Protection and Human Rights",11 Mar 2022,"Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights: Liz Throssell, Location: Geneva, Date: 11 March 2022, Subject: Ukraine, We remain gravely concerned by the rising death toll and human suffering in Ukraine and call for an immediate end to the attacks. We have so far recorded 549 civilian deaths and 957 injuries since the armed attack began on 24 February, although the actual figure could be much higher., Civilians are being killed and maimed in what appear to be indiscriminate attacks, with Russian forces using explosive weapons with wide area effects in or near populated areas. These include missiles, heavy artillery shells and rockets, as well as airstrikes., Schools, hospitals, and kindergartens have been hit – with hugely devastating consequences. On 3 March, 47 civilians were killed when Russian airstrikes hit two schools and several apartment blocks in Chernihiv. On 9 March, a Russian airstrike hit Mariupol Hospital No.3 injuring at least 17 civilians. We are still investigating reports that at least three civilians may have been killed in the airstrike. We spoke to different sources in Mariupol, including local authorities, indicating consistently that the hospital was both clearly identifiable and operational when it was hit., We have also received credible reports of several cases of Russian forces using cluster munitions, including in populated areas. On 24 February, a cluster munition exploded at the Central City Hospital in Vuhledar, in government-controlled Donetsk, killing four civilians, injuring 10 others, and damaging ambulances, civilian vehicles and the hospital itself. There were other cluster munition attacks in several districts of Kharkiv, in which nine civilians were killed and 37 injured., Due to their wide area effects, the use of cluster munitions in populated areas is incompatible with the international humanitarian law principles governing the conduct of hostilities., Civilian casualties are rising daily, as is general human suffering. We remind the Russian authorities that directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects, as well as so-called area bombardment in towns and villages and other forms of indiscriminate attacks, are prohibited under international law and may amount to war crimes., We also remain concerned by continued reports of arbitrary arrests and detention of Ukrainians who voice their opposition to the Russian attack, including in peaceful protests. We have documented individual cases of such arbitrary arrests in the east of Ukraine, but have been asked not to release details, as there are concerns regarding the safety of those who have spoken to us. We believe that those detained are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment and call for their immediate and unconditional release. We are also concerned by the pejorative use of labels such as “saboteurs” and “mercenaries”, with the intent or effect of exposing certain individuals to higher risks of harm., We call on the parties to fully respect the rights of everyone under their control. Those who have laid down their weapons or are hors de combat by injury or detention, including prisoners of war, must be treated humanely, and be protected from any form of torture or degrading treatment., ENDS, For more information and media requests, please contact:

Ukraine war: “Bombs on a maternity and children’s hospital are utterly unacceptable”,News and Press Release,CARE,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",10 Mar 2022,"As the war in Ukraine enters its third week this Thursday, the humanitarian organization CARE International is deeply worried about the protection of civilians caught in the crosslines. ""Over the past two weeks, there have been numerous reports of impacts on civilian infrastructure, most recently even on a maternity and pediatric hospital"", says CARE's humanitarian advocacy coordinator Delphine Pinault. ""Bombs on hospitals that house expecting mothers, new-born babies and children at their most vulnerable, are an unacceptable breach of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Law."", Since the beginning of the war, the World Health Organization has confirmed at least 18 incidences of severe impacts on medical facilities in Ukraine, with fatal consequences in some instances and devastating damages to the infrastructure and equipment. CARE strongly calls on conflict parties to minimize the effects of the war on civilians by respecting the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction, the corner stones of IHL., ""Civilians, and especially women, pregnant women and those with new-born and small children bear the brunt of this horrifying escalation of violence"", notes Pinault. ""We know from other conflicts such as Syria and Yemen that the specific needs of women, girls and children are far too often unmet in war times: pre- and postnatal care, safe delivery facilities, protection from abuse, exploitation and violence as well as safe shelters and adequate nutrition should be a priority for this humanitarian response"". Ukraine also has a large population of elderly and disabled women who face even greater risks., Civilians always pay the highest price. This escalating violence - which is resulting in civilian deaths, including children -- is totally unacceptable. The protection of civilians, including their safe passage to voluntarily leave Ukraine in whatever direction they choose must be priority number one"", says CARE's Delphine Pinault., The road to safety is particularly dangerous for women travelling alone with their children, as men have to stay behind. 25-year-old Eugenie made the trip of 28 hours to reach neighbouring Romania with her 11-month-old baby Mikhael and 5-year-old Sofia. ""It was very scary on the road. We saw 8 missiles coming overhead at one point. My husband drove us to the border, to safety, and then he turned around and went back. I am so scared for him."", *About CARE: Founded in 1945, CARE is a leading humanitarian organization fighting global poverty. CARE has more than seven decades of experience helping people prepare for disasters, providing lifesaving assistance when a crisis hits, and helping communities recover after the emergency has passed. CARE places special focus on women and children, who are often disproportionately affected by disasters. To learn more, visit www.care-international.org., As part of the Ukraine response, CARE International is currently partnering with People in Need, one of the largest non-governmental organisations in Eastern Europe and has provided humanitarian aid in the affected regions of Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict in 2014. CARE is also working with its long-term partner of 20 years SERA - a child protection focused organization - in Romania to deliver assistance to those fleeing into Romania from Ukraine.*",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-war-bombs-maternity-and-children-s-hospital-are-utterly-unacceptable

Food security implications of the Ukraine conflict (March 2022),Analysis,WFP,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",11 Mar 2022,"Ukraine war: More countries will ‘feel the burn’ as food and energy price rises fuel hunger, warns WFP, Increased costs set to affect World Food Programme operations and impact the most vulnerable well beyond Ukraine’s borders, The World Food Programme (WFP) is working to minimize the knock-on effects of rising food and energy prices – triggered by the Ukraine conflict – on hunger around the world, while it looks to scale up operations within the country and reach 3.1 million people. “[As] hunger threatens Ukraine directly, the fallout from this war will spread across the globe. Russia and Ukraine together export about 30 percent of the world’s wheat,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley., A report just published by WFP warns that the costs of its global operations look set to increase by US$29 million a month. When added to pre-existing increases of US$42 million (since 2019), the total additional costs facing WFP are US$71 million per month., This could spell disaster for millions, as WFP had already warned that 2022 would be a year of catastrophic hunger, with 44 million people in 38 countries teetering on the edge of famine., As well as exporting a significant proportion of the world’s wheat, over the past ten years Ukraine has become WFP’s biggest supplier of foods such as sunflower oil., With Russia being such a huge player in the energy sector, inevitable prices hikes resulting from sanctions on its oil and gas will limit access to food for some of the most vulnerable people in the world, many of whom are already facing super-high inflation, according to the report., Adding to woes, shipping costs are multiplying with ‘war risk’ insurance premiums of up to US$300,00 for some voyages., “As the war heats up, dozens of distant countries are set to feel the burn,” Beasley said., “With our funding levelling off because donor nations’ treasuries are so stretched, we have had to slash rations to refugees and other vulnerable populations across East Africa and the Middle East,” he added. “Halved rations mean hungry children eating the equivalent of just one bowl of cereal each day.”, Places where WFP has had to reduce rations include Yemen, one of the world’s worst hunger crises, where 16.2 million people are food insecure and there are pockets of famine-like conditions., With Ukrainian ports closed and Russian grain deals on pause because of sanctions, 13.5 million tons of wheat and 16 million tons of maize are currently frozen in Russia and Ukraine, WFP’s report states., Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Syria are particularly vulnerable to any hold-up on wheat imports, on which millions of people are heavily dependent. These countries, where WFP is running emergency operations, are already reeling from the combined effect of conflict, climate change, the coronavirus pandemic and rising costs., n the Middle East and North Africa region, higher food and energy prices also spell misery for Lebanon and Yemen, while complications are expected in East Africa, where 84 percent of wheat demand is met by imports., The report warns of “cancellations or delays of WFP shipments from the port of Odessa” which will “likely primarily affect West Africa,” where the cargo is needed for distributions from May onwards., Because of scarcity, war, the pandemic’s economic aftershocks and crude oil prices near a 13-year high, WFP is already paying 30 percent more for food than it was in 2019,” said Beasley. “If the Black Sea transport corridors are disrupted further by this burgeoning war, transport prices will spike in lockstep, doubling or even tripling.”, He added: “Very soon, surviving Ukrainian farmers will be trying to seed their spring fields in some of the world’s richest earth, from where WFP had hitherto drawn more than half our wheat.” But the war will likely hinder that., “If Ukrainian fields lie fallow this year, aid agencies such as ours will be forced to source new markets to compensate for the loss of some of the world’s best wheat. Doing so will come at a vastly inflated cost., ”This week, Beasley visited border towns in Poland where WFP staff are ramping up operations to support the disrupted commercial supply chain inside Ukraine and deliver assistance to over 3 million people. Working with local NGO Tarilka, WFP has already started a 10-day daily distribution of 30,000 loaves of bread in Kharkiv, benefiting 60,000 people, as it seeks to scale up exponentially. WFP has also mobilized a consignment of wheat flour that is being moved by rail to Kyiv., “Even as humanitarians and governments feed those who make it out, the systems that feed the tens of millions trapped inside Ukraine are falling apart: trucks and trains destroyed, airports bombed, bridges fallen, supermarkets emptied and warehouses drained,” said Beasley., DONATE to WFP's Ukraine response",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/food-security-implications-ukraine-conflict-march-2022

Ukraine: Federal Council approves CHF 80 million for Swiss humanitarian aid in Ukraine and wider region,News and Press Release,Govt. Switzerland,Contributions,11 Mar 2022,"Bern, 11.03.2022 - Around 12 million people are dependent on emergency aid because of Russia's ongoing military intervention in Ukraine. At its meeting of 11 March, the Federal Council decided to increase humanitarian aid to Ukraine and the wider region to CHF 80 million. With this contribution, Switzerland is expressing its solidarity with Ukrainians in need., About 12 million people are currently dependent on emergency aid as a result of the Russian attack on Ukraine. Many lack access to electricity, water, food and other basic necessities. Millions have been forced to flee their homes but remain in Ukraine. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) warns that over two million people have already fled to neighbouring countries – more than half of them to Poland. The vast majority of those displaced are women and children, as able-bodied men are obliged to remain behind in Ukraine to defend their country. In their latest appeals for support, the UN and the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement put the funding needs for Ukraine and neighbouring countries at just under USD 2 billion over the next three months., Switzerland responded swiftly to the war in Ukraine with humanitarian aid. Switzerland's humanitarian support package currently involves three elements: sending relief supplies, deploying Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit (SHA) specialists and providing financial support to humanitarian organisations. To date, Switzerland has sent over 500 tonnes of relief supplies to Ukraine, Poland and Moldova. Switzerland's support package for the initial phase of the aid operation amounts to CHF 8 million., Major increase in financial aid
In response to the refugee crisis, the Federal Council decided at its meeting of 11 March to increase humanitarian aid to Ukraine to a total of CHF 80 million. With this contribution, Switzerland is expressing its solidarity with the people of Ukraine in their time of need., A quarter of this sum will be used to help Ukrainian refugees in neighbouring countries. Three quarters are earmarked to help those who have remained in Ukraine. The funds will go to the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, UN agencies, international and local NGOs and projects implemented by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) in Ukraine., The FDFA is contributing CHF 21 million from existing credits; the Federal Department of Justice and Police CHF 6 million. The remaining CHF 53 million are additional funds and will be submitted to parliamentary approval., Address for enquiries, For further information:

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 10 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,10 Mar 2022,"From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 10 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 1,546 civilian casualties in the country: 564 killed and 982 injured. This included:, a total of 564 killed (106 men, 73 women, 6 girls, and 9 boys, as well as 26 children and 344 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 982 injured (83 men, 67 women, 14 girls, and 4 boys, as well as 34 children and 780 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 622 casualties (128 killed and 494 injured), On Government-controlled territory: 481 casualties (103 killed and 378 injured), On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 141 casualties (25 killed and 116 injured), In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 924 casualties (436 killed and 488 injured)
Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes.
OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, the towns of Volnovakha, Mariupol, Izium where there are allegations of hundreds of civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics.
OHCHR notes the report of the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, according to which as of 11 a.m. (local time) 10 March, 71 children had been killed and more than 100 injured., An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00 midnight on 9 March 2022 local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 10 March only, as during the day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days., The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available and numbers may change as new information emerges over time., Since 24 February 2022, in the context of the Russian Federation's military action in Ukraine, HRMMU has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview victims and witnesses there. All other sources of information have been extensively used, including HRMMU contact persons and partners in places where civilian casualties occurred. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the ""reasonable grounds to believe"" standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described., ENDS, Ukrainian and Russian language versions of this update as they become available, please visit this page., For more information and media requests, please contact:, Liz Throssell + 41 22 917 9296 / elizabeth.throssell@un.org, Tag and share Twitter @UNHumanRights Facebook unitednationshumanrights Instagram @unitednationshumanrights, [1]An increase in figures in this update compared with the previous update (as of 24:00, 6 March 2022, local time) should not be attributed to civilian casualties that occurred on 7 March 2022 only, as during the day OHCHR also corroborated casualties that occurred on previous days.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-10-march-2022-enruuk

HIV/Aids",10 Mar 2022,"GENEVA – The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has approved US$30 million to top up its Emergency Fund, including US$15 million to support the continuity of HIV and TB prevention, testing and treatment services in Ukraine. This is on top of the US$119.4 million allocated to Ukraine to support the fight against HIV and TB in the country over the 2020-2022 period, and of the US$46.6 million granted for the COVID-19 response since the pandemic broke out., “We are extremely alarmed by the devastating effects on peoples’ lives in Ukraine,” said Peter Sands, Executive Director of the Global Fund. “Ensuring patients affected by the conflict can continue to access prevention and treatment services is our immediate priority.”, Over the last 20 years, the Global Fund has invested more than US$850 million in Ukraine for HIV and TB testing, prevention and treatment programs and to fight COVID-19 by protecting front-line workers and reinforcing systems for health., Despite remarkable achievements in combatting HIV and TB in recent years, Ukraine has the second largest HIV epidemic in Eastern Europe and Central Asia and remains one of the high-priority countries to fight TB in the region., The Global Fund’s Emergency Fund is designed to support countries when disasters, conflicts or other emergencies are impacting the provision of HIV, TB or malaria treatment and prevention or other health services., The newly approved additional emergency funds also aim to respond to the negative impact on other Global Fund-supported health programs, including disruptions caused by the conflict in Ethiopia’s northwestern Tigray region and by Tropical Cyclone Ana in Malawi and Mozambique., In 2021, the Global Fund approved nearly US$16 million in emergency funding to ensure the continued availability of essential prevention and treatment services in Afghanistan and Haiti.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/global-fund-approves-emergency-funding-maintain-essential-hiv-and-tb-services-ukraine

Afghan family in Ukraine forced to flee conflict for second time in eight months,News and Press Release,Save the Children,Protection and Human Rights,10 Mar 2022,"“We came here for peace. Nobody could believe there would be bombing... but it was not a dream”, Suceava, 11 March 2022 - Vicious conflict has forced a family from Afghanistan to flee across borders twice in less than a year., Fourteen year-old Samad* and his family faced the unthinkable when fighting erupted in Ukraine just eight months after they fled violence in Afghanistan., Samad's father Mohammad* said: ""My family came here for peace. But when they heard fighting would start here... nobody could believe it. That there would be bombing, there would be fighting. But it was real. It was not a dream."", Fighting in Ukraine has forced hundreds of thousands of children into neighbouring countries in the space of just two weeks. Hundreds of civilians have been killed, including children. Schools and health facilities have come under attack., Away from the violence which has escalated to horrific levels in Ukraine, conflict rages in many places across the world. The number of children living in high intensity conflict zones is rising, reaching 193 million according to the latest figures., Samad and his family were in eastern Afghanistan when fighting escalated across the country in July 2021. Along with his father, mother and two grown up siblings, Samad made it to Kabul where they spent three days outside the airport trying to secure their escape, with gunfire ringing out as the alarming pictures were beamed across the world., Samad said: ""It was war and it was bombing, and very bad days. A lot of people were killed in this war. So we left Afghanistan."", When they finally made it inside and onto an evacuation flight their destination was Ukraine, where Mohammad had spent time living and working for thirty years. The thought that just months later they would be fleeing for their lives a second time was unimaginable., But the unimaginable happened. Samad was settling into life in eastern Ukraine, going to school, making friends and starting to learn the language when suddenly he and his family found themselves in the path of approaching bombardment again., Samad said: ""It was a very big thing for me to come from war, and live in a peaceful place... This was very good for me and my family. I made friends... I came to school. And the people were very kindly."", As the fighting started, Samad and his family heard explosions in the distance. They made the devastating decision to flee another country., For Samad, the echoes of eight months ago are unavoidable. ""It was just like this in Kabul. A lot of people wanted to leave Kabul and go to a peaceful place. And [in Ukraine], a lot of people wanted to leave and go to a peaceful place, for their children, for themselves., ""When the war started in Afghanistan we left our house full of things."" Now, after rebuilding their lives once, they were forced to abandoned everything they own in Ukraine. ""We just closed and locked our house and came here,"" he added., They drove for more than thirty hours on crowded roads before waiting three days at the border, sleeping in their car while temperatures plummeted outside. With shelves at roadside petrol stations emptying, they were glad they had brought food with them. That was all they had managed to bring apart from the clothes on their backs., The overwhelming feeling of relief when they crossed the border was sadly all too familiar. ""I felt well, because we survived 2nd war... Just like when I came to Kyiv, the feeling was the same when I came to Romania."", Gabriela Alexandrescu, CEO of Save the Children Romania, said: ""Children and families across Ukraine are facing impossible decisions every day. The choice between retreating below ground to try and survive a terrifying onslaught or abandoning everything and escaping as conflict rages is one no parent should have to make. To be forced to flee across borders twice in the space of months is almost impossible to conceive., ""Many people originally from outside Europe are fleeing Ukraine and they need Europe's help and protection."", Save the Children is calling on EU Member states to ensure that those who were seeking international protection in Ukraine will be granted temporary protection in the EU country where they have fled, and that they can apply for international protection in the EU if they wish to do so. That would grant Samad and his family the same protection and opportunities as Ukrainians who, like them, fled the country after when conflict erupted., For now, it's impossible for Samad to comprehend the impact of what he has been through. ""In the future I will miss a lot of things that I had there. [But] for us it's a very big thing for us to be safe, it's enough for us to be safe here."", Mohammad knows just how hard it has been on his family. ""Of course it is very hard to leave your home, your house, your country your city. But there was no option... We have seen two wars."", Samad, Mohammad and their family are currently seeking asylum in northern Romania, staying in a reception centre while their documents are processed as some of the family do not have passports., With tens of thousands of people entering the country in a short period of time, the response of the authorities, Save the Children and other organisations helping at the border at least helped Mohammad and his family feel welcome in Romania in the midst of so much chaos and uncertainty., Their future is not yet certain. Hopes and fears about what will come next exist side by side. ""We're just in a camp, and I'm worried for my future. I want to study, I want to be a good man. For my family, for my future, for myself,"" said Samad., Mohammad added, ""Everything will be right. I think so. I hope so."", Save the Children is encouraged by the response of neighbouring countries opening their borders to those fleeing horrific violence in Ukraine. Neighbouring states should ensure that all those fleeing Ukraine, are granted unhindered access to territory, regardless of status and in accordance with International Humanitarian Law., Save the Children works in the reception centre where Samad and his family are staying and provided them with information and guidance, clothes and shoes. The aid agency is also on the border distributing food, blankets and hygiene kits., Notes to editors, Save the Children staff and volunteers are distributing food, water and hygiene kits to to IDPs inside Ukraine and refugees arriving at the Romania-Ukraine border and in reception centres., In Poland and Romania, we provide Child Protection services including targeted support for unaccompanied and separated children, psychosocial support and access to legal services., Save the Children works with refugee and migrant children inside and outside of Europe, aiming to support vulnerable children with the greatest needs., Individuals should not attempt private adoption as such services are unregulated.

"Even wars have laws: CARE implores Ukraine conflict parties to spare hospitals, routes to safety",News and Press Release,CARE,Protection and Human Rights,11 Mar 2022,"As the war in Ukraine enters its third week, the humanitarian organisation CARE is deeply worried about the protection of civilians caught in the crosslines., “Over the past two weeks, there have been numerous reports of impacts on civilian
infrastructure, most recently even on a maternity and paediatric hospital”, says CARE’s humanitarian advocacy coordinator Delphine Pinault., “Bombs on hospitals that house expecting mothers, new-born babies and children at their most vulnerable, are an unacceptable breach of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Law.”, Since the beginning of the war, the World Health Organisation has confirmed at least 18 incidences of severe impacts on medical facilities in Ukraine, with fatal consequences in some instances and devastating damages to the infrastructure and equipment., CARE strongly calls on conflict parties to minimise the effects of the war on civilians by respecting the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction, the cornerstones of International Humanitarian Law., “Civilians, and especially women, pregnant women and those with new-born and small children bear the brunt of this horrifying escalation of violence”, notes Pinault., “We know from other conflicts such as Syria and Yemen that the specific needs of women, girls and children are far too often unmet inwar times: pre- and postnatal care, safe delivery facilities, protection from abuse, exploitation and violence as well as safe shelters and adequate nutrition should be a priority for this humanitarian response. Ukraine also has a large population of elderly and disabled women who face even greater risks., “Civilians always pay the highest price. This escalating violence – which is resulting in civilian deaths, including children – is totally unacceptable. The protection of civilians, including their safe passage to voluntarily leave Ukraine in whatever direction they choose must be priority number one“, says CARE’s Delphine Pinault., The road to safety is particularly dangerous for women travelling alone with their children, as men have to stay behind., 25-year-old Eugenie made the trip of 28 hours to reach neighbouring Romania with her 11-month-old baby Mikhael and 5-year-old Sofia., “It was very scary on the road. We saw 8 missiles coming overhead at one point. My husband drove us to the border, to safety, and then he turned around and went back. I am so scared for him.”, Donate to CARE Australia’s Ukraine crisis appeal, For interviews, photos and other media resources, contact Iona Salter on 0413 185 634",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/even-wars-have-laws-care-implores-ukraine-conflict-parties-spare-hospitals-routes

Ensuring the health and safety of Ukrainian refugees is a matter of high concern for the charity as the situation continues to evolve., “Many of these families scrambled to leave a frightening situation and urgently need medical assistance,” Sohail said. “Sending medical aid now will help provide lifesaving assistance before the situation gets worse.”, According to the UN, an estimated 1 million people fled Ukraine in the span of one week. Many have sought refuge in neighboring countries such as Poland, Hungary and Moldova. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has killed more than 400 people and injured over 800 so far, and the situation continues to deteriorate., To help with emergency aid efforts for Ukrainian refugees, donors can contribute to the Baitulmaal Ukraine Emergency fund at https://baitulmaal.org/help4ukraine., Baitulmaal is an international humanitarian nonprofit that provides life-saving, life-sustaining and life-enriching aid to people in need around the world.

Ukraine: Humanitarian corridors for civilians fleeing Russian attacks must provide safety – new testimonies,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,10 Mar 2022,"Civilians whose homes have been destroyed and others fearing for their lives forced to flee Russian bombardment must be granted access to safe humanitarian corridors, Amnesty International said today., To date, thousands of people have been living under unlawful bombardment, while millions of people have been forcibly displaced over the course of two weeks of conflict in Ukraine. Russian forces’ assault on civilian populations and wanton destruction of the infrastructure of daily life violate the Geneva Conventions and international human rights law and must cease., At a bare minimum, safe evacuation routes must be provided and yet, to date, many such corridors have proven both unreliable and dangerous. Ukraine and Russia first agreed on 3 March to establish humanitarian corridors for civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery, but implementation to date has been slow and limited. It is urgent that civilians seeking safety from the bombardments, including those whose homes have been destroyed be provided safe passage. They further should not be forced to relocate to Russian-controlled territory., “Genuine humanitarian corridors must be established quickly, effectively, and safely. Civilians must not be put at even more risk as they seek to escape the conflict,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General., “The deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian objects and indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international law. All unlawful attacks must cease. This pressing need for humanitarian corridors is a direct result of Russia’s betrayal of its legal obligations. Regrettably humanitarian corridors are needed urgently., “The parties to the conflict must give absolute priority to civilians’ safe passage out of the conflict areas and into safe havens, meaning also not to those under Russian control. Russian forces must also immediately allow humanitarian aid to reach civilians who remain in their homes.”, Ukrainian authorities have requested that the routes should allow civilians from heavily bombed Mariupol, Enerhodar, Sumy, Izyum and Volnovakha to escape, and for residents of several towns close to Kyiv – including Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel – to reach the capital. Testimonies that Amnesty International have collected to date from civilians in several of these locations indicate they were prevented from leaving by continuous Russian shelling., Amnesty International is calling on the parties to agree on establishing well-planned, safe humanitarian corridors and to respect such agreements in good faith; for civilians to be provided accessible transportation as well as sufficient time to safely exit, and for international observers to be granted access to monitor their safe passage., “Civilians must be protected at all times. Safe and secure humanitarian corridors are a must, but unlawful attacks which are killing and injuring civilians must cease forthwith and comprehensively,” said Agnès Callamard., “International humanitarian law prohibits attacks against civilians and civilian objects, indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. Hospitals, schools and civilian infrastructure must be protected. Even wars have laws.”, The parties must grant impartial humanitarian relief organizations access to all civilians in need, including those who remain after evacuations. Russian forces must not employ the types of illegal sieges of civilians reminiscent of those they carried out in Grozny and Syria, subjecting them to indiscriminate bombardment, destroying infrastructure and leaving them with the choice to surrender or starve. Amnesty International also objects to any plan which would require civilians to relocate to areas they consider unsafe, including the occupied Crimea or Donbass regions of Ukraine, or Russia., Attacks in Irpin, On Sunday 6 March, near the town of Irpin, a Kyiv suburb, Russian fire hit an evacuation crossing point, killing several civilians who were trying to flee., One woman, who was in a convoy of 12 cars of civilians with signs marked ‘kids’ leaving Irpin, told Amnesty International they came under attack from Russian soldiers., She said: “In two, three minutes [after they passed a destroyed tank] the shooting began. We know for sure that a 30-year-old woman died, [and a relative’s] mother died: she was 60, she was with me in the car., “A shard or a bullet went two millimetres from my brother-in-law’s eye, [and] his arm is broken. Our driver has an issue with his ribs. I’m OK, a small wound close to my head, just blood… but in general, everything is fine with me. The other woman, who lost her mother… everything is OK with her too.”, Journalists filming in the area reported that another Russian attack occurred as civilians were streaming through an intersection, killing four people, including a woman and two of her children. Media also reported repeated firing and shelling in the area, raising concerns that these attacks were indiscriminate or disproportionate, violating the rules of international humanitarian law., ‘It isn’t possible to leave’, Amnesty International is concerned that certain groups will face particular challenges if they try to escape the conflict. In interviews with Ukrainian residents of threatened cities, the organization learned of people with disabilities, older people, and people with health conditions who are less able to easily evacuate their homes, seek safety during attacks, or get medical care., Elena Kozachenko, a 38-year-old from Chernihiv, has breast cancer and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. She said: “I have cancer and I need to get medication. I had my last round of chemotherapy on 23 February. My next chemotherapy is supposed to be 16 April. I need check-ups, but they are bombing all the time in the neighbourhood where the cancer hospital is, it’s too scary to go there.”, “I want to leave because staying in Ukraine [now] with my diagnosis is suicide. [But] it isn’t possible to leave… I’m afraid to evacuate because I’m a living target.”, Many older people impacted by the conflict face great difficulty in trying to flee or in seeking safety during attacks, and are often less willing to leave homes where they have lived for decades, or even their whole lives., Rita, a 64-year-old family doctor in Kyiv, explained: “Kyiv is an old city, all of the older people, people with limited mobility, can’t get from their apartments to the basement. In our building they wanted to turn off the electricity [at night] so as not to attract bombardment… We said it would be a death sentence for the older people; if they can’t use the lift, they can’t leave their apartments at all.”, A member of the Kyiv regional council – who represents Irpin, Bucha, and other communities under Russian siege – added: “It’s mostly [older people] who are staying… It is more safe for them to stay than to go without money or food, because it’s in their native town – they know their neighbours. If they move out, they’re not sure somebody will help them; they don’t have the money to move.”, Tatyana Sobko, a 70-year-old in Kyiv, told Amnesty International: “We don’t want to leave, our children have tried to take us away many times… This is our home, how can you abandon your home and go sit somewhere abroad? How is that possible?… It’s our land and we won’t run away.”, Older people and people with disabilities, as well as other groups who may face particular risks and challenges in fleeing, should be prioritized for evacuation, as is outlined under international humanitarian law. Planning and communication about evacuations and safe humanitarian corridors must also be undertaken in an inclusive way, including by ensuring that information, transportation, and services are all accessible., Interviewees across Ukraine also told Amnesty International of living in cramped conditions, and suffering severe shortages of food, water and medicine. Some have been unable to leave basements for days on end, due to relentless Russian shelling. They have also been experiencing loss of electricity, heating and communications for days.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-corridors-civilians-fleeing-russian-attacks-must-provide-safety

Humanitarian access to Ukraine is currently very restricted and the situation is constantly changing. According to the UN Refugee Agency, as of 10 March 2022, more than 2.3 million people have crossed international borders into neigh- bouring countries., The UN Flash Appeal launched on 1 March is projecting up to 18 million people directly affected by the conflict and 12 million people in need, alongside 6.7 million people internally displaced. It is estimated that up to 4 million people might be displaced across the border, with many neighbouring and European countries (including Denmark) expressing a wish to support., Crisis Response Plan March, DRC is one of the largest and most experienced international NGOs responding to multiple crisis globally, with expertise in numerous humanitarian sectors and operational modalities. Operating within Ukraine since 1998 with over 200 staff, DRC is currently scaling up its operation in Ukraine to deliver lifesaving assistance and emergency response to the many people affected by the conflict., Furthermore, DRC is right now building a response structure in neighbouring countries of Moldova, Romania and Poland to assist people from Ukraine crossing borders in search of refuge and international protection there or as they transit towards other European countries., Within the wider Europe, DRC is scaling up its existing operations in Italy, Georgia, Greece and possibly in Kosovo Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to engage in asylum counselling, protection, reception, and inclusion support to people arriving from Ukraine., Given its Danish origin, DRC’s engagement in Denmark, is framed by its role as a national refugee man- dated civil society organisation with a defined role in the asylum procedure and refugee integration work in Denmark. Therefore, DRC engages with Ukrainian diaspora, a network of more than 6,000 volunteers, immigration authorities and municipalities to establish an overview of the need for help and provide direct support including legal aid to the people of Ukraine already arriving in Denmark, while preparing for new arrivals.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-response-11-march-2022

Khan QC, on the Situation in Ukraine: Additional Referrals from Japan and North Macedonia; Contact portal launched for provision of information [EN/RU/UK]",News and Press Release,ICC,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,11 Mar 2022,"On 28 February 2022, I announced my decision to seek authorisation to open an investigation into the Situation in Ukraine, on the basis of my Office's earlier conclusions arising from its preliminary examination, and encompassing any new alleged crimes falling within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (""ICC"" or ""the Court""). By 2 March, my Office had received referrals of the Situation in Ukraine from 39 ICC States Parties, allowing me to immediately open an investigation and commence evidence-collection., Today, I can confirm that an additional two States, Japan and North Macedonia have referred the Situation in Ukraine to my Office, bringing the total number of referring States to 41., I note that this action by Japan represents an expansion of the regional groups engaged in the referral of the Ukraine situation. They are the first Asian State to do so. I am grateful to Japan for this further expression of their staunch support for the work of my Office, which is already reflected by their position as leading financial contributor to the ICC., My Office has responded immediately to this unprecedented collective call for action by States Parties. The investigative team that I deployed to the region last week has already commenced evidence-collection activities. I am also personally seeking to engage with all relevant stakeholders and parties to the conflict with the aim of strengthening channels for the collection of relevant information and engendering coordinated action towards our common goal of ensuring accountability for crimes falling within ICC jurisdiction., International criminal investigations require the engagement of all those who may hold information relevant to our work. Witnesses, survivors and affected communities in particular must be empowered to actively contribute to our investigations. There can be no bystanders in our effort to establish the truth and pursue those allegedly responsible for international crimes., I can therefore announce today that my Office has established a dedicated portal through which any person that may hold information relevant to the Ukraine situation can contact our investigators. I encourage all those with relevant information to come forward and contact our Team through this platform, which can be accessed here., We will be circulating this portal widely on social media channels and I would encourage all relevant stakeholders, including media outlets, both local to the Situation in Ukraine and internationally, to raise awareness of this platform., The collective support of all States Parties and the international community more broadly will also continue to be essential as my Office moves to accelerate its work across all its investigations. To this end, I can further announce that I have circulated a formal communication extending an invitation to all States Parties to provide assistance to my Office including through voluntary financial contributions and the provision of national experts on a secondment basis. This will be essential in addressing the urgent resource needs of my Office and in allowing us to effectively address all situations presently under investigation or in trial. I have already been encouraged by the initial response from States Parties to this call for support., I wish to conclude by underlining that, as our investigation team continues its work on the ground, I am closely following the deeply troubling developments in hostilities. The events of recent days require me to again emphasise that all those involved in this conflict must adhere strictly to the applicable rules of international humanitarian law., I note, in particular, that if attacks are intentionally directed against the civilian population: that is a crime. If attacks are intentionally directed against civilian objects: that is a crime. I strongly urge parties to the conflict to avoid the use of heavy explosive weapons in populated areas, There is no legal justification, there is no excuse, for attacks which are indiscriminate, or which are disproportionate in their effects on the civilian population., My Office will continue its work on the Situation in Ukraine and will seek to further deepen its engagement with all actors in pursuit of our common objective in ensuring accountability for international crimes.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-icc-prosecutor-karim-aa-khan-qc-situation-ukraine-additional-referrals

"We are responsible for our children – message by Rita Izsák-Ndiaye, Personal Representative of the Chairman-in-Office on Children and Security",News and Press Release,OSCE,Protection and Human Rights,11 Mar 2022,"VIENNA, 11 March 2022 - I received the following WhatsApp message on 2 March from a Nigerian mother and her husband, both of them students in Ukraine, asking for help:, “On 24 February, when the war started, we were in Kyiv, and I suddenly went into labour because of the shock of the bombs. I was able to get to the hospital and deliver the baby. But then very close to the hospital, they threw bombs again, several times. It was terrifying to know that you can’t even help your baby if anything happens. The next morning, we were told to leave the hospital and look for shelter. Shops were closed and we hadn’t stocked our house with food. We heard the bombs close to the house. Yesterday, luckily, we were able to take a train and go to Uzhhorod and then pass the border to Hungary. We got us a little shelter where we can stay for the time being. It’s cold, really cold here but I was able to cover the baby, I used my body to wrap the baby around, so he doesn’t freeze.”, Within a day, with the help of some amazing and caring friends in Budapest, we managed to find them a safe place to stay, where they are now trying to overcome the trauma they went through., Their precious newborn, just like millions of other babies and children, is experiencing a war that he knows nothing about. Children in shelters with no possibility of movement, no school or playground in sight. Children on the move, often without papers, accompanied by their mothers and grandparents, or worse, unaccompanied, left all alone, freezing, exposed to insecurity and uncertainty. These children are living through severe trauma that may interfere with their ability to live a normal life., These children know nothing about article 38 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child, which makes clear that States must respect international humanitarian law, protect civilian populations in armed conflicts, and ensure the protection and care of children who are affected by armed conflict., These children do not know that OSCE participating States decided in 1990 to accord particular attention to the recognition of the rights of the child. That in 1999 they committed themselves to actively promote children's rights and interests, especially in conflict and post-conflict situations, and to pay particular attention to the physical and psychological well-being of children involved in or affected by armed conflict., However we do know this and we must do everything in our power to uphold these principles and commitments., Children in Ukraine are being killed, wounded, and traumatized for a lifetime. According to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, as of 7 March 2022, there were 1,335 civilian casualties; 29 children were killed and 41 children were injured., The true number of casualties may be much higher, especially due to the more intense hostilities that are taking place now. There are reports of hospitals, maternity wards, schools, water and sanitation facilities and orphanages being under fire. There are several reported cases of shelling of educational facilities., By 8 March, two million Ukrainians had fled the country. Hundreds of thousands of people are on the move, searching for shelter and safety, including in neighboring countries. Half of them are children. According to UNICEF, humanitarian needs across the country are multiplying by the hour. Thousands of families are without safe drinking water and many have been cut off from access to other essential services. There is a shortage of critical medical supplies. All 7.5 million children of Ukraine are now extremely vulnerable., We must remember those most vulnerable, orphans, undocumented or stateless children, children with severe illness or disability, those in need of continuous care and medication. Roma children, children in marginalized communities and those whose skin color results in additional barriers while fleeing and seeking help., The shelling in urban areas causing death and injury to civilians must stop. Humanitarian corridors must be secured and safe passage guaranteed to civilians. Children must be kept safe. Basic services and facilities, including psychosocial support and trauma counselling, must be allowed to operate and to deliver essential assistance to all children in need, regardless of their status and ethnic background. It is imperative to integrate children’s rights and children’s protection into mediation processes and peace negotiations., We must act as role models for our children. We should demonstrate how a global rules-based system can work to their benefit. The longer this conflict goes on, the more difficult it will become not only to heal, restore normal life, rebuild the country, and repair a torn social fabric. It will also be more difficult to raise a new generation able to act towards one another in a spirit of kinship, as the most basic international human rights norm, article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, expects from all of us., Contacts, Communication and Media Relations Section

Afghan family in Ukraine forced to flee conflict for second time in eight months,News and Press Release,DEC,Protection and Human Rights,11 Mar 2022,"“We came here for peace. Nobody could believe there would be bombing... but it was not a dream”, Images and footage of the family available here., Suceava, Romania, Conflict has forced a family from Afghanistan to flee across borders twice in less than a year after taking refuge in Ukraine., Fourteen-year-old Samad* and his family faced the unthinkable when fighting erupted in Ukraine just eight months after they fled violence in Afghanistan., Samad’s father Mohammad* said: “My family came here for peace. But when they heard fighting would start here… nobody could believe it. That there would be bombing, there would be fighting. But it was real. It was not a dream.”, Fighting in Ukraine has forced hundreds of thousands of children into neighbouring countries in the space of just two weeks. Hundreds of civilians have been killed, including children. Schools and health facilities have come under attack., Away from the violence which has escalated to horrific levels in Ukraine, conflict rages in many places across the world. The number of children living in high intensity conflict zones is rising, reaching 193 million according to the latest figures., Samad and his family were in eastern Afghanistan when fighting escalated across the country in July 2021. Along with his father, mother and two grown up siblings, Samad made it to Kabul where they spent three days outside the airport trying to secure their escape, with gunfire ringing out as the alarming pictures were beamed across the world., Samad said: “It was war and it was bombing, and very bad days. A lot of people were killed in this war. So we left Afghanistan.”, When they finally made it inside and onto an evacuation flight their destination was Ukraine, where Mohammad had spent time living and working for 30 years. The thought that just months later they would be fleeing for their lives a second time was unimaginable., But the unimaginable happened. Samad was settling into life in eastern Ukraine, going to school, making friends and starting to learn the language when suddenly he and his family found themselves in the path of approaching bombardment again., Samad said: “It was a very big thing for me to come from war, and live in a peaceful place… This was very good for me and my family. I made friends... I came to school. And the people were very kindly.”, As the fighting started, Samad and his family heard explosions in the distance. They made the devastating decision to flee another country., For Samad, the echoes of eight months ago are unavoidable. “It was just like this in Kabul. A lot of people wanted to leave Kabul and go to a peaceful place. And [in Ukraine], a lot of people wanted to leave and go to a peaceful place, for their children, for themselves., “When the war started in Afghanistan we left our house full of things.” Now, after rebuilding their lives once, they were forced to abandoned everything they own in Ukraine. “We just closed and locked our house and came here,” he added., They drove for more than thirty hours on crowded roads before waiting three days at the border, sleeping in their car while temperatures plummeted outside. With shelves at roadside petrol stations emptying, they were glad they had brought food with them. That was all they had managed to bring apart from the clothes on their backs., The overwhelming feeling of relief when they crossed the border was sadly all too familiar. “Just like when I came to Kyiv, the feeling was the same when I came to Romania.”, The public’s incredible generosity has helped to raise over £150 million in a single week for the Disaster Emergency Committee’s Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal, including £25 million matched by the UK Government, in an inspiring demonstration of support for people fleeing the conflict., Donations to the DEC appeal mean that DEC charities and their local partners are able to respond immediately to urgent needs both inside Ukraine and on its borders, and help rebuild lives in the months and years to come., DEC member charity Save the Children works in the reception centre where Samad and his family are staying and provided them with information and guidance, clothes and shoes. The aid agency is also on the border distributing food, blankets and hygiene kits., Gabriela Alexandrescu, CEO of Save the Children Romania, said: “Children and families across Ukraine are facing impossible decisions every day. The choice between retreating below ground to try and survive a terrifying onslaught or abandoning everything and escaping as conflict rages is one no parent should have to make. To be forced to flee across borders twice in the space of months is almost impossible to conceive., “Many people originally from outside Europe are fleeing Ukraine and they need Europe’s help and protection.”, For now, it’s impossible for Samad to comprehend the impact of what he has been through. “In the future I will miss a lot of things that I had there. [But] for us it’s a very big thing for us to be safe, it’s enough for us to be safe here.”, Mohammad knows just how hard it has been on his family. “Of course it is very hard to leave your home, your house, your country your city. But there was no option.”, With tens of thousands of people entering the country in a short period of time, the funds donated to DEC’s appeal allows DEC member charities to help people like Mohammad and his family and ensure they feel welcome in Romania in the midst of so much chaos and uncertainty., Their future is not yet certain. Hopes and fears about what will come next exist side by side. “We’re just in a camp, and I’m worried for my future. I want to study, I want to be a good man. For my family, for my future, for myself,” said Samad., Mohammad added, “Everything will be right. I think so. I hope so.”, *Name changed to protect identity, ENDS, Notes to Editors:, Multimedia content available here, Media enquiries please call 020 7387 0200 or 07734 653616 (out of hours)., DEC charities are working in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries, ramping up efforts to meet the growing humanitarian need.

Update 17 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (10 March 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,10 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it had lost today all communications with the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), the day after the Russian-controlled site lost all external power supplies, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., The Director General said that the Agency is aware of reports that power has now been restored to the site and is looking for confirmation., Earlier in the day, the Ukraine regulatory authority had told the IAEA that emergency diesel generators were providing electricity to the Chornobyl NPP. The subsequent loss of communication meant that the regulator could no longer provide updated information about the site to the IAEA., According to the information received before the loss of communication, both of the site’s power lines had been damaged, in effect disconnecting it from the grid, the Ukraine’s regulatory authority said. To ensure continued power, these lines would either need to be repaired or the generators holding fuel for two days would require additional diesel deliveries. The diesel generators were powering systems important for safety, including those for spent nuclear fuel and water control and chemical water treatment, the regulatory authority said, adding that the operator was not able to maintain some functions such as radiation monitoring, ventilation systems, and normal lighting., Nevertheless, as reported in Update 16, the disconnection from the grid will not have a critical impact on essential safety functions at the site, where various radioactive waste management facilities are located, as the volume of cooling water in the spent fuel facility is sufficient to maintain heat removal without a supply of electricity., The regulator further confirmed this assessment, stating that the safety analysis report for the site’s spent fuel storage facility concluded that there would be “no impact on essential safety systems” in the case of a total loss of power, including electricity provided by emergency sources such as diesel generators. Furthermore, the operator has also been able to confirm that there are no damages in the structures and systems of the spent fuel storage pool, and their original functions are maintained., If emergency power was also to be lost, the regulator said it would still be possible for staff to monitor the water level and temperature of the spent fuel pool. But they would carry out this work under worsening radiation safety conditions due to a lack of ventilation at the facility. They would also not be able to follow operational radiation safety procedures., The Director General has expressed alarm about the deteriorating and exhausting conditions for staff at the Chornobyl NPP, who have not been able to rotate since the day before Russian forces took control on 24 February. He has said this is also compromising a vital safety pillar, which states that “operating staff must be able to fulfil their safety and security duties and have the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure”. Further adding to the stressful situation is the total loss of communication. The site had earlier been able to communicate with the regulator by email., Regarding the status of Ukraine’s operational nuclear power plants, the regulator said eight of the country’s 15 reactors remained operating, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP, three at Rivne, one at Khmelnytskyy, and two at South Ukraine. Radiation levels at the four sites were normal, it said., The Zaporizhzhya NPP site power supply situation is unchanged from that reported in Update 16. The site has four high voltage (750 kV) offsite power lines plus an additional one on standby. Two of the four have been damaged and therefore currently there are two power lines, plus the one on standby. The operator informed the IAEA that the NPP off-site power needs could be provided with one power line available. Furthermore, diesel generators are ready and functional to provide back-up power., However, in another challenge for the same plant, it was not currently possible to deliver necessary spare parts, equipment and specialized personnel to the site to carry out planned repairs, and maintenance activities at Unit 1 had been reduced to the minimum level required by the plant operational procedures., The Director General also said that the IAEA is in contact with Ukraine authorities regarding radiation monitoring systems in Ukraine., Regarding the loss of remote data transmission from the safeguards systems installed to monitor nuclear material and activities at the Chernobyl NPP and Zaporizhzhya NPP, reported in Update 16, the IAEA has not been able to re-establish communication with those installed monitoring systems., Director General Grossi today held talks with the Foreign Ministers of Ukraine and the Russian Federation - Dmytro Kuleba and Sergei Lavrov – in Antalya, Turkey. He held a press conference upon his return to Vienna.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-17-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-10-march-2022-enru

(Source: FTS), SITUATION OVERVIEW, After more than two weeks of intense fighting, civilian casualties continue to mount across the country. Between 4 a.m. on 24 February and midnight on 9 March, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports at least 1,506 civilian casualties, including 549 killed., On 9 March, the maternity and children’s wards of a prenatal hospital in the centre of Mariupol were destroyed in an attack. Less than a kilometre away, explosions later that day damaged a university and city council building in the city, adding to the scores of homes, grocery stores and other critical infrastructure damaged or destroyed. The civilian toll has yet to be confirmed., On 9 March, Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company Energoatom announced that all nuclear facilities in the Chornobyl exclusion zone were without power, warning of a possible nuclear discharge. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) later reported that there has not been any critical impact to the safety of Chornobyl, adding that the plant’s fuel storage pool and volume of cooling water remain sufficient to effectively remove heat without electricity., Since 24 February, an estimated 4.2 million people have been forcibly displaced during the Ukraine crisis. This includes 2.3 million refugees who have fled to other countries, as reported by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, and an estimated 1.85 million people internally displaced, according to the Ukraine Protection Cluster. The Protection Cluster further reports that the largest locations of internally displaced people (IDP) are in Zakarpatska (500,600), Lvivska (386,900) and Volynska (169,500) oblasts in the west and north-west of the country. The displaced populations – mainly women, children and older persons – face significant protection risks and require urgent multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance that is tailored to their specific needs., The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed at least 24 attacks on health facilities, health workers and ambulances, killing at least 12 people and injuring 17 more. Amid harsh winter temperatures, WHO says that displaced people face growing risks of hypothermia, frostbite, respiratory diseases and mental health issues, adding that the current conditions on the ground are ripe for the growth and spread of infectious diseases., International humanitarian organizations continue to rapidly scale up their response activities against the ever-growing scope and scale of needs across Ukraine. Still, access and security constraints prevent humanitarian organizations from reaching those most affected, with local authorities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and civil society actors better positioned to respond to people in need quickly and effectively. However, these organizations need safe and predictable windows of silence and safe passage in and out of affected communities, along with access to streamlined additional funding, to sustain and expand life-saving response activities., SITUATION OVERVIEW, After more than two weeks of intense fighting, civilian casualties continue to mount across the country. Between 4 a.m. on 24 February and midnight on 9 March, OHCHR reports at least 1,506 civilian casualties, including 549 killed. OHCHR also reports 608 casualties in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (99 killed and 370 injured in Government-controlled areas, GCA, and 24 killed and 115 injured in non-Government-controlled areas, NGCA) and 898 civilian casualties in other regions of Ukraine., The actual number of civilian casualties across Ukraine is likely much higher, as reports in some locations experiencing intense fighting in recent days are still pending corroboration. In Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east) alone, local authorities claim that around 1,300 civilians have been killed since the military offensive began on 24 February., On 9 March, a 12-hour ceasefire agreed to by both sides of the conflict largely failed to facilitate the wide-scale evacuation of people trapped in dire conditions across Ukraine. While evacuations did get underway in five of the six cities agreed to for the safe passage of civilians, including Enerhodar (Zaporizka oblast, south) and Sumy (Sumska oblast, north-east), there was limited movement of people out of the worst-affected areas, like Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east) and the satellite towns of Kyiv (north)., In Bucha – a city of nearly 37,000 people north of Kyiv – forces reportedly blocked the evacuation of people through an agreed safe passage route as some 50 buses attempted to evacuate conflict-affected people. In Izyum – home to around 46,600 people in Kharkivska oblast (east) – local authorities reported that the safe evacuation of civilians could not be carried out as hostilities continued unabated., Nevertheless, national authorities report that more than 51,500 people were successfully evacuated between 8 and 9 March, mainly from the cities of Sumy and Enerhodar. The Russian Federation reports that it has so far evacuated around 187,000 people from Ukraine towards Russia., The delay of civilian evacuations from the conflict-ravaged city of Mariupol has left hundreds of thousands of people trapped in a rapidly deteriorating humanitarian crisis. On 9 March, attacks on civilian infrastructure in the alreadydevastated city escalated. Attacks reportedly destroyed the maternity and children’s wards of a hospital in the centre of Mariupol. The civilian toll has yet to be confirmed., Less than a kilometre away, explosions later that day damaged a university and city council building in Mariupol, adding to the scores of homes, grocery stores and other critical infrastructure damaged or destroyed amid the ongoing military encirclement of the city. For nearly two weeks, the affected population has remained without safe water, electricity, and access to the most basic supplies, like food and essential medicines, that are in desperately short supply., Fighting in Kyivska oblast continues to flare up in new localities, while others have been under continued attack almost since the beginning of intensified hostilities over two weeks ago. In Nemishaieve – a small town of around 7,800 people – residents have reportedly been sheltering in their homes amid relentless shelling that has left the town without water, electricity and heat since 28 February. As of 9 March, the town is without gas supply as well, further exacerbating already dire conditions., On 9 March, the announcement of Ukraine’s state-run nuclear company Energoatom that all nuclear facilities in the Chornobyl exclusion zone were without power, possibly triggering nuclear discharge, served as an ominous reminder of the potentially catastrophic public health and environmental impacts of the ongoing conflict. Fortunately, IAEA reported that there has not been any critical impact to the safety of Chornobyl, adding that the plant’s fuel storage pool and volume of cooling water remain sufficient to effectively remove heat without electricity., Between 24 February and 8 March, WHO confirmed at least 24 attacks on health facilities, killing at least 12 people and injuring 17 more. Amid harsh winter temperatures, WHO says that displaced people face growing risks of hypothermia, frostbite, respiratory diseases and mental health issues, adding that the current conditions on the ground are ripe for the growth and spread of infectious diseases. Amid the ongoing military offensive, WHO has delivered around 81 tons of medical supplies to Ukraine and surrounding countries and is establishing a pipeline to ensure that much-needed relief support reaches health facilities and affected people in the hardest-hit areas., International humanitarian organizations continue to rapidly scale up their response activities to match the ever-growing scope and scale of needs across Ukraine. The Ukrainian Red Cross has already delivered around 400 tons of humanitarian aid to affected people, including food, hygiene kits, medicines, blankets and tents. Still, access and security constraints prevent humanitarian organizations from reaching those most affected, with local authorities, nongovernmental organizations and civil society actors better positioned to quickly and effectively respond to people in need. However, these organizations need safe and predictable windows of silence and safe passage in and out of affected communities, along with access to streamlined additional funding, to sustain and expand life-saving response activities as soon as possible.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-10-march-2022
"ACLED Regional Overview – Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (24 February - 4 March 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,10 Mar 2022,"Last week in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, the Russian invasion of Ukraine entered its second week. The ongoing invasion prompted demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine throughout the region, alongside a much smaller number of demonstrations in support of Russia. In France, an attack on a Corsican prisoner sparked demonstration activity. Meanwhile, fighting continued along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact., In Ukraine, the second week of the full-scale Russian invasion was marked by increased targeting of civilians by the Russian military, which included deliberate shelling of hospitals, kindergartens, and residential buildings (The Guardian, 27 February 2022). In addition, Russian forces shelled humanitarian corridors set up for residents of Volnovakha and Mariupol in the Donetsk region, killing civilians (Reuters, 5 March 2022). According to estimates from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), 532 civilians were killed and 675 were wounded across Ukraine as of 4 March (Deutsche Welle, 4 March 2022). However, the actual numbers could be much higher. Fatality numbers are frequently the most biased and poorly reported component of conflict data; they can vary considerably and are often the subject of debate given the strategic incentives to over- or underestimate these numbers, as well as the significant logistical difficulties in collecting accurate data, among other factors (*for more, see this piece by ACLED in *Washington Post, 2 October 2017). Russian forces also seized Europe’s largest nuclear power station in Zaporizhia, with fighting causing a fire to break out on the site, raising fears of a possible nuclear disaster (Al Jazeera, 4 March 2022). Overall, the invasion contributed to the 166% increase in violence in Ukraine over the past month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the country last month. Previously peaceful regions — such as Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia, and Kyiv — experienced greater than 1000% increases in violence last week relative to the past month (over 2000% percent in Kyiv), as flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Surge Tracker.1 (ACLED’s new Ukraine Crisis page serves as a research hub, offering curated data, an interactive dashboard, the latest analysis, and more.), In Belarus, the government of Alexander Lukashenko staged a successful referendum on 27 February to legalize expansions to its support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The referendum included constitutional amendments that allow Russian troops and nuclear weapons to be permanently stationed in Belarus, expand Lukashenko’s presidential powers, and provide Lukashenko with immunity from prosecution (RFE/RL, 28 February 2022). Around 65% of voters voted in favor of the proposed changes, although independent observers argue that the campaign restricted voices against the proposed changes and against the referendum (Viasna, 1 March 2022)., Since 24 February, the EU has imposed numerous sanctions against both Russia and Belarus. These include freezing the assets of Russian and Belarusian officials and government-aligned businessmen, banning transactions with the Russian central bank, deferring approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and closing EU airspace to Russian carriers (Reuters, 7 March 2022). As a result of these sanctions, Russia surpassed Iran to become the most sanctioned country in the world (Bloomberg, 7 March 2022). Additionally, around 280 international companies pulled out of Russia in response to the Russian invasion (Yale School of Management, 8 March 2022)., The ongoing armed conflict has forced more than two million people to flee Ukraine since 24 February, with the majority – 1.2 million – arriving in Poland (UNHCR, 8 March 2022). Moldova accepted over 80,000 refugees from Ukraine, becoming the country with the largest number of Ukrainian refugees per capita (BBC, 8 March 2022). Moreover, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that there could be over one million internally displaced people in Ukraine, moving to the safer western regions of the country and putting a strain on the local resources (BBC, 8 March 2022)., Demonstrations denouncing the Russian invasion of Ukraine continued across the region last week. In Ukraine, demonstrations centered in towns where Russian military forces were present. In several war-torn regions — including Chernihiv, Zaporizhia, Kherson, and Luhansk — people took to the streets to demand Russian forces leave Ukraine. In many instances, people gathered on roads and attempted to prevent Russian military vehicles from entering their town. In Bucha, Kyiv region, local residents threw Molotov cocktails at the approaching Russian infantry fighting vehicles (Novoye Vremya Ukraine, 27 February 2022). In Zaporizhia region, Russian forces opened fire and threw grenades at the protesting crowd, injuring two people (061.ua, 2 March 2022)., In Russia, people held nearly 100 demonstration events across the country last week to oppose the large-scale Russian invasion and war against Ukraine. Police intervened in the majority of these demonstrations, detaining hundreds of participants. In Belarus, on 27 February and 28 February, Belarusians took to the streets to demonstrate in Minsk and several other cities against the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Belarus’ participation in it. Around 900 people were arrested for participation and the organization of demonstrations (Viasna, 4 March 2022; Viasna, 28 February 2022)., Demonstrations against Russian military aggression and in support of Ukraine also took place in Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Hungary, Cyprus, Moldova, Albania, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Norway, Latvia, Sweden, Denmark, Georgia, Serbia, Lithuania, Estonia, Montenegro, Armenia, Kyrgyzstan, Iceland, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Andorra, Austria, France, Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, San Marino, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In Germany, one of the largest demonstrations in recent German history took place in Berlin on 27 February, with between 100,000 and 500,000 demonstrators protesting against the war in Ukraine (Al Jazeera, 27 February 2022; Exberliner, 28 February 2022)., Conversely, several countries also saw demonstrations in support of Russia amid the war with Ukraine, including in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Armenia., Meanwhile, in France, a prison attack on a prominent Corsican militant separatist prompted demonstrations across Corsica last week. On 2 March, Yvan Colonna was attacked and strangled by a jihadi prisoner in the prison of Arles, leaving him in a coma (RFI, 3 March 2022); Colonna is affiliated with the National Liberation Front of Corsica (FLNC), and is condemned to life in prison for the assassination of a French prefect in 1998. The FLNC was a militant group advocating for a free Corsican state; it ceased operation in June 2014; however, there have been splinter groups that have committed violence since then in their name, suggesting a resurgence (France3, 23 June 2017; France3, 2 September 2021). Colonna’s supporters hold the French government responsible for the attack, calling the attack an attempted assassination. They organized demonstrations across Corsica, largely at the call of Corsican independence political parties, Femu a Corsica and Corsica Libera, and a Corsican independence movement, Core in Fronte. The attack on Colonna contributes to the 26% increase in violence in France over the past week relative to the past month that is flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map.2, Along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, fighting decreased last week compared to the week prior. All ceasefire violations last week were reported in the Tovuz region. A recent spate of ceasefire violations has contributed to the 34% increase in violence in Azerbaijan and Artsakh3 last month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the region last month.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-24-february-4-march-2022
RSF and Free Press Unlimited join efforts to support at-risk Ukrainian journalists,News and Press Release,RSF,Protection and Human Rights,9 Mar 2022,"**As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to be backed by an information war, the two international press freedom organisations for the promotion of journalism are entering a partnership on the Lviv Press Freedom Centre and the Media Lifeline Ukraine initiative to bring coordinated and efficient support to Ukrainian journalists and media at risk. Two leading NGOs in the field of journalism join efforts to support Ukrainian journalists. This is vital now that communication lines are severed, journalists face hardship to report and whilst censorship prevents audiences in neighbouring countries from access to fact based, verified and relevant content. **, Cooperation is vital in order to support the courageous journalists and independent media outlets who are informing the public about the war in Ukraine. Coordination assures avoiding overlap and creates a central access point for Ukrainian journalists and media (but also for journalists / media from the region) to go to for support., The Paris based international press freedom organisation Reporters without Borders (RSF) will cooperate with the Amsterdam based Free Press Unlimited (FPU), specialised in media development, in order to support Ukrainian media and journalists and to keep reliable information available. FPU will contribute to the activities of the Lviv Press Freedom Centre, and RSF will mobilise its support for Media Lifeline Ukraine., On 4 March, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) announced it would be launching the Press Freedom Centre, in Lviv, Western Ukraine, together with its local partner, the Institute for Mass Information (IMI). The Lviv Press Freedom Centre aims to serve as a reception and distribution hub for protective equipment for journalists, particularly bulletproof vests and helmets, which are currently in short supply. This physical and digital centre will also provide resources to journalists seeking financial or psychological assistance and will launch an accompanying digital portal to channel requests and evaluate needs., On 4 March, Free Press Unlimited (FPU) launched the Media LifeLine Ukraine initiative, with support of Dutch media stakeholders. Media Lifeline Ukraine aims to secure the free flow of information for the public in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries. Media Lifeline is a one stop shop, to respond to all the needs of partners and journalists in Ukraine and beyond., “Unprecedented crisis require unprecedented alliances,” said Christophe Deloire, Secretary-General of RSF. “FPU and RSF share the same values and missions and our teams are devoted to responding to the needs of Ukrainian and international reporters covering the war. Uniting our strengths will enable us to go further and quicker.”, “People in Ukraine need to know where it is safe to go and where attacks are expected. International audiences - including the policymakers and politicians deciding on sanctions and relations with Russia and Ukraine - need to be informed on what is happening. Whether civilians are attacked or whether parties adhere to cease fires.” says Ruth Kronenburg, Director of Operations at Free Press Unlimited., The two organisations call on donors to contribute to this effort in the coming weeks to ensure all needs are covered and that procurement, shipment and distribution is mutualized.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/rsf-and-free-press-unlimited-join-efforts-support-risk-ukrainian-journalists
War in Ukraine: journalists constantly risking their lives [EN/RU],News and Press Release,RSF,Protection and Human Rights,8 Mar 2022,"Several media crews have already come under fire and four reporters have sustained gunshot injuries in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion less than two weeks ago. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) reiterates its call to the Russian and Ukrainian authorities to comply with their international obligations to guarantee the safety of reporters in the field, and urges the latter to take the utmost care., The shots came within centimetres of Swiss photographer Guillaume Briquet’s head when presumed members of a Russian special commando fired on him shortly after he passed a Ukrainian checkpoint on a road towards the southern city of Mykolaiv on 6 March, while covering the Russian advance in the region. Despite the many “Press” markings on his car and his bulletproof vest marked “Press,” this experienced war reporter was then harassed by the soldiers, who stole 3,000 euros and reporting equipment from him., “As this incident clearly illustrates, reporters in the field are targets for belligerents despite all the rules protecting journalists,” said Jeanne Cavelier, the head of RSF’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk. “They are civilians, who are keeping the world informed about the progress of the fighting. They must be able to work safely. We therefore call on all parties to the conflict to immediately commit to protecting journalists in the field in accordance with international law. We also recommend that journalists exercise the utmost caution in the light of the many attacks by Russian commandos sent ahead as scouts.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/war-ukraine-journalists-constantly-risking-their-lives-enru

Office of Press Relations
press@usaid.gov, Today, Vice President Kamala Harris announced nearly $53 million in additional humanitarian assistance from the United States government, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), to support Ukrainians affected by Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine., This additional assistance includes support to the UN World Food Programme (WFP) to provide lifesaving emergency food assistance, including high-energy biscuits, to meet immediate needs. This assistance is for hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians affected by the invasion, including people who are displaced from their homes and who are crossing the border out of Ukraine. In addition, it will support WFP’s logistics operations to move assistance into Ukraine, including to people in Kyiv., The United States stands with the people of Ukraine and will continue to work to meet immediate needs and save lives. The United States is the single largest donor of humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and has provided $159 million in overall humanitarian assistance to Ukraine since October 2020. In the past two weeks, the United States has provided nearly $107 million in humanitarian assistance in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. USAID’s Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) based in the region is leading the U.S. humanitarian response to the crisis in Ukraine. In addition, USAID's development programming has ramped up in the wake of the crisis to respond to cyber attacks, disinformation, threats to the energy sector, essential health needs, and to support the continued functioning of local and national government entities., To date, over two million people have been forced to flee Ukraine due to the conflict, and an estimated one million are displaced inside Ukraine.

IMF Executive Board Approves US$ 1.4 Billion in Emergency Financing Support to Ukraine [EN/RU/UK/ZH],News and Press Release,IMF,Recovery and Reconstruction,9 Mar 2022,"Washington, DC : The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a disbursement of US$1.4 billion (SDR 1,005.9 million) under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to help meet urgent financing needs and mitigate the economic impact of the war., The Executive Board expressed its strong support for the Ukrainian people., The war in Ukraine is resulting in tragic loss of life and human suffering. While the outlook is subject to extraordinary uncertainty, the economic consequences are already very serious, with refugee flows of over 2 million persons in just 13 days and large-scale destruction of key infrastructure in Ukraine. This disbursement under the RFI, equivalent to 50 percent of Ukraine’s quota in the IMF, will help meet urgent balance of payment needs arising from the impacts of the ongoing war and will provide critical support in the short term while playing a catalytic role for financing from other partners., The Ukrainian authorities have canceled the Stand-by Arrangement and the authorities have expressed their intent to work with the IMF to design an appropriate economic program aimed at rehabilitation and growth, when conditions permit. The authorities intend to remain in close consultation with staff as they continue to design and implement effective crisis mitigation measures., Following the Executive Board discussion, Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director and Chair, made the following statement:, The Russian military invasion of Ukraine has been responsible for a massive humanitarian and economic crisis. The tragic loss of life, huge refugee flows, and immense destruction of infrastructure and productive capacity is causing severe human suffering and will lead to a deep recession this year. Financing needs are large, urgent, and could rise significantly as the war continues., The emergency policy response of the Ukrainian authorities has been remarkable. Administrative and capital controls have been introduced to preserve the availability of foreign exchange reserves and reduce uncertainty regarding the exchange rate. To further support financial stability, the National Bank of Ukraine has established a new liquidity facility and introduced regulatory forbearance measures. While cash withdrawal limits have been imposed, cashless transactions have not been limited. Fiscal policy has focused on ensuring priority payments. Ukraine has stayed current on all debt obligations., Against this extraordinary background, the IMF has approved critical financial support. This should be instrumental in catalyzing the large-scale mobilization of additional concessional financing that will be required to help fill the financing gap and mitigate the economic impacts of the war. Once the war is over and a proper damage assessment can be performed, additional large support is likely to be needed to support reconstruction efforts., The Fund expresses its deepest sympathy to the Ukrainian people in these extraordinarily difficult times and will remain closely engaged with the Ukrainian authorities., IMF Communications Department

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24.00 9 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],Situation Report,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,10 Mar 2022,"Date: 10 March 2022, From 4 a.m. on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 24:00 midnight on 9 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 1,506 civilian casualties in the country: 549 killed and 957 injured., This included:, a total of 549 killed (101 men, 67 women, 6 girls, and 9 boys, as well as 26 children and 340 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 957 injured (81 men, 64 women, 14 girls, and 4 boys, as well as 34 children and 760 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 608 casualties (123 killed and 485 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 469 casualties (99 killed and 370 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 139 casualties (24 killed and 115 injured) o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 898 casualties (426 killed and 472 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, the towns of Volnovakha, Mariupol, Izium where there are allegations of hundreds of civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, according to which as of 1 p.m. (local time) 9 March, 61 children had been killed and 100 injured. OHCHR also notes a report by the National Police of Kharkiv region, according to which as of 6 p.m. (local time) 8 March, the total number of civilian casualties in Kharkiv region was 170 killed (165 adults and 5 children) and 368 injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-9-march-2022-enruuk
Ukraine: JRS in action to welcome refugees,News and Press Release,JRS,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",1 Mar 2022,"JRS has been following with concern the developments in Ukraine even before the start of the Russian military offensive. We join with Pope Francis in grieving the “diabolical senselessness of violence” and in asking all parties to “refrain from any action that would cause more suffering.” While we hope that they will soon be able to return safely, JRS and the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) are mobilizing resources worldwide to provide immediate support in Ukraine and in neighboring countries. JRS stands close in thoughts and prayers with people being forced to leave their homes. We welcome efforts by the EU and its Member States, in particular those neighboring Ukraine, to keep borders open and welcome those forced to flee and we call on the EU to respond with unity and in solidarity in the short and long term., In Ukraine: helping those fleeing, supporting the internally displaced, In Lviv, where JRS is present, the security situation is still relatively calm. Many people are arriving from other parts of Ukraine. The majority of them intends to reach the Polish border and often need support or a place to spend the night on their way there. JRS refugee house, with a capacity of about 20 people, is currently been used to that end. Also the retreat house of the Jesuits has been immediately converted into a transit house for displaced people., In Romania: JRS on the first line, Between the 24th and 28th of February, 70.000 people have transited from Ukraine into Romania. About 30.000 of them quickly left for other EU countries, while about 28.000 chose to remain. Only a small minority officially applied for asylum for the moment, so most of them are legally migrants and not entitled to reception as asylum seekers. Both the Romanian authorities and citizens are showing great enthusiasm to welcome people, however coordination is still needed in the different responses., JRS Romania is providing support both in the centers for asylum seekers along the borders and to the people who are not in the centers, by providing welcome packages, acting as a mediator between private donors, government organizations and the people in need, supporting people to reach airports and train stations, providing accommodation in JRS’s own shelter and looking for more accommodation for people in need., In Poland and Hungary: creating and supporting a welcoming infrastructure, Poland is for the moment the country receiving the most arrivals of people from Ukraine. Many are staying with family and friends as well as travelling forward to other EU countries. JRS is mobilizing to facilitate transportation for people from the borders as well as providing basic supplies and supporting people finding provisional accommodation through rental assistance. Additional support in the form of legal, administrative as well as psychological assistance is being organized., Hungary is receiving smaller numbers of people for the moment, including Hungarians who were living across the border in Ukraine. The government has expressed the will to support the refugees and the Hungarian population is reacting in a very welcoming way. JRS has a small presence in the country and at this moment is assessing how to best be of use. Hungary is traditionally a transit country for refugees, however in this case, should the conflict continue, it is likely that many Ukrainians will want to remain. JRS is therefore already looking into medium-term support needs, such as longer term accommodation support, next to the more immediate needs such as food and healthcare supplies., In South-East Europe: preparing from the ‘second line’, Bearing in mind the experience of the Crimean crisis in 2014, JRS in South-East Europe (Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, North-Macedonia) is also preparing to receive some Ukrainian refugees should the conflict persist. Contingency planning is prepared, including the search for potential accommodation within families, parishes and Jesuit houses. Relevant contacts with government authorities and municipalities, such as the city of Zagreb in Croatia, are being established in order to be ready with response based on hospitality in case of need., At the EU level: advocating for a welcoming response, At the regional level JRS Europe is monitoring the developments in the region as a whole and the EU’s response in particular., We welcome the initial positive response of the EU Member States, determined to react as a Union and provide protection to people feel Ukraine and we strongly support the proposal of activating the procedure to provide temporary protection in cases of max influx of refugees as foreseen by the Temporary Protection Directive., We wish to stress that all people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine should be allowed to leave the country, irrespective of their nationality. Once in safety, and within adequate reception conditions, the protection needs of third country nationals that are not Ukrainians can be assessed according to the existing procedures and the repatriation of those who wish to return to their home-countries can and should be facilitated., Next to the immediate response, EU Member States need to quickly discuss and agree on a responsibility-sharing scheme, including clear relocation measures, to ensure that the workload of Ukraine’s neighboring countries remains under control and that EU standards of protection and reception conditions can be guaranteed. Finally, the protection needs of Ukrainians who were already outside the country when the conflict started must also be recognized.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-jrs-action-welcome-refugees

They arrived in Morshyn, western Ukraine, three days after the Russian invasion. “By the time we left Kholodna Hora, it was already under fire. At the same time, people were quietly walking to buy some bread. I mean, a lot of people still hope that everything is going to be okay,” Natasha describes the day they left home. “I called the taxi. The taxi driver said that he took his family out of the town, and he continued working. I asked: ´Why do you not leave?´ He said, ´Who, if not us?´,” she says., “I realized that wars do not end quickly. So, I have accepted my company’s offer to relocate, and I have come here by bus,” Natasha states, adding that they crossed many checkpoints and passport controls on the way. “It breaks my heart to realize how many of my friends are staying there.”, Natasha and Ivan got to Lviv in western Ukraine and began looking for a place to stay. Finally, they found a place in an old sanatorium in Morshyn. This building was recently re-opened for people are fleeing the war. Natasha needs to carefully consider her next moves, noting, ""I am not going anywhere right now. Only if the bombs will fall, I would leave."" Although her son Ivan is highly adaptable, Natasha is concerned about him. “He is fine, but I think he is traumatized. In any case, it could reveal later on,” she concludes., We wanted to take our children to a safer place, “We’ll never forget Thursday, February 24th. Our children spent nine days in the basement after it,” says Svitlana, currently displaced in Opaka in western Ukraine. After the time spent in the basement, fear, and concerns for her family's safety, Svitlana decided to flee. She fled with her daughter Nastia (24 years old), granddaughter Maia (1-year-old) and several other mothers with children who were afraid to stay home due to the intensive fighting in the area., The women took the train from Zaporizhzhia to Lviv, which took 30 hours. Svitlana informs us that the journey “was terribly cold in the train. When we entered, there was no heating. But on the way, it was already warmer. The train was very slow on the way; besides, we stopped every time when the sirens were heard,” she goes on to note that “The train was full of mothers and children, some of them were crying. Nobody wanted to leave our city, our husbands, fathers, brothers, relatives and friends. But we wanted to take our children to a safer place. We were scared. But we’ll come back home because we’ll win this war”., After thirty hours on the train, Svitlana and the other women and children went to the sanatorium in Opaka. They covered more than one hundred kilometres by bus and were utterly exhausted by the very long and complicated journey. “When we arrived, we were happy that it is calm here. Despite the fact that there is no heating, we are happy. It is a beautiful landscape. It’s very nice here. But we desperately want to go back home,” she noted wearily., We’ve spent several days in the bomb shelter, “We’ve spent several days in the bomb shelter with my six years old daughter. It was terrible there. There were other mothers with children, and some of them got sick as it was cold and wet in the shelter. And we decided to leave to Lviv, jointly with other women and children as it is much easier to go together,” says Iryna, 30-years-old from Zaporizhzhia. Like many innocent civilians seeking safety in Lviv, she spent thirty hours on the train with two more on the bus to the Opaka sanatorium, where the families are hosted for free., “It is very quiet here. We are not afraid as we were in Zaporizhzhia,” shares Iryna. “But anyway, we desperately want home… In the worst-case scenario, if the bombing will start here, we’ll go to Poland. But I don’t want to! I want to go home,” adds Iryna. “We are not discussing the war with children. But they feel and understand that something very bad is happening. We don’t need anything but peace in our country so that we can go back home,” says Iryna., People in Need plans to support centres where people like Natasha, Iryna and Svitlana are seeking safety.

Moldova: Rapid Needs Assessment of Older Refugees – 10 March 2022,Assessment,HelpAge,"Food and Nutrition

Shelter and Non-Food Items
Water Sanitation Hygiene",10 Mar 2022,"Context, An estimated 230,000 refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine to Moldova, with 120,000 of these planning to remain in the country., As much of the border with Ukraine is part of Transnistria (an area of Moldova with links to Russia) most refugees are entering through the southern tip of Moldova close to the Ukrainian port city of Odessa. Despite the amazing support provided by Moldovan volunteers and the government, people and resources are being stretched to their limit., Moldova is one of the poorest countries in Europe with a population of only 2.6 million, making it the country with the most refugees per-capita. Ensuring adequate assistance is provided to all Ukrainian refugees arriving in the country is vital, including those at greater risk such as older people and those with disabilities. However, given the levels of poverty in Moldova, consideration should also be given to their needs when considering any interventions in the country., Methodology, To provide a snapshot of the current needs, 105 older people (aged 50+) were interviewed by HelpAge International using a short multi-sectoral needs assessment between 4 and 6 March. 60% of these interviews were conducted at the border (Palanca, Costești, Tudora) and 40% at refugee centres in Chisinau. A convenience sampling approach was used in identifying older people. The small sample and approach used limits the representativeness and disaggregation of this data. Therefore, unless further assessments, encompassing age disaggregated data, are conducted by other actors, this will be the first of several on-going larger assessments that HelpAge will conduct. Also, older refugees may also not yet have a clear picture of their longer terms needs. As the crisis evolves their responses may change, as will their needs., Movement, • Most older refugees interviewed have arrived in Moldova from neighbouring areas in Ukraine, with the highest number arriving from Odessa. However, some have travelled further from cities such as Kyiv and Dnipro in what are likely to have been very difficult and traumatizing journeys, complicated by mobility issues that many older people face., • 56% of older refugees reported that they are not planning to stay in Moldova for more than three months and aim to move onto another country. Supporting them in their on-going journey is therefore likely to be needed, especially for older people travelling alone (including accessing buses and even support with VISA processes). Only 17% plan to stay longer with family and friends within the country., • 27% of older people reported that they did not know if they are going to stay in Moldova. This highlights the chaos and uncertainty many refugees face. Currently around 98 temporary shelters / refugee centres have been established where many of the most at-risk older refugees have gone. However, many other refugees are currently staying in hotels or rented accommodation where prices may be increasing as supply reduces. Others are being tempoarly housed by Moldovans for free. Therefore, accommodation options need to be found both temporarily and, in some cases, longer-term., • 62% of older people reported that they are travelling with children. As most men under 60 have remained in Ukraine, and in many cases have been conscripted into the army, older people will likely play an increasingly crucial role in providing care to children. For those staying in Moldova this can include support in enrolling children in their care at local schools., • 10% of those interviewed are travelling alone. This group faces particular risks, and their support needs may be higher. Where possible, helping them reunite with family and friends will be important, as well as ensuring they can access mobile phones and sim cards.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/moldova-rapid-needs-assessment-older-refugees-10-march-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",10 Mar 2022,"Budapest/Geneva, 10 March 2022 – As the conflict continues in Ukraine and a cold front descends, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) warns of the dire health - including the spread of COVID-19 - and mental health consequences for millions of people both inside and outside of the country., The fighting in Ukraine has continued for two weeks and no one has been left unscathed. An estimated 18 million people – a third of the country’s population – will need humanitarian assistance, and more than 2.3 million people have fled to neighbouring countries. As the lives of millions are being upended, there is a real concern of diseases spreading, pre-existing health conditions worsening and mental health concerns increasing., “Many of the people affected were already vulnerable before the conflict and now face an even harsher situation as they are losing their homes and their livelihoods, being forced to seek shelter wherever they can or fleeing their country in search of safety. They urgently need food, water and shelter, but also emergency medical care, protective measures and psychosocial support to avert an even greater humanitarian catastrophe,” said Birgitte Bischoff Ebbesen, IFRC Regional Director for Europe., At the Przemyśl railway station in Poland, a woman was crying and being comforted by a volunteer from the Polish Red Cross. When asked what had happened, she answered that she had spent the whole night and day waiting for the train from Ukraine that would bring her daughter to safety. The train had finally arrived, but her daughter had not., People fleeing conflict often experience highly distressing situations, loss and trauma, which may impact their mental health and ability to cope. Psychosocial support will be needed in the days, weeks, and months to come., In conflict settings, public health measures to prevent diseases from spreading become extremely challenging. People are forced to shelter in crowded spaces with limited sanitary conditions or access to basic health services, which increases the risk of infectious disease outbreaks, such as tuberculosis and diarrheal diseases. The spread of COVID-19 is a particular concern as the vaccination rate in Ukraine is among the lowest in Europe with only one-third of the population having received the first dose. Ukraine also has one of the highest rates of multidrug resistant tuberculosis in the world., Adding to what is already a desperate situation, temperatures are dropping below freezing. There is an urgent need for warm clothing and adequate shelter to shield people in temporary locations and those who are queuing at the borders from the elements, the majority of whom are women, children and older people., “Our Red Cross and Red Crescent teams in Ukraine and neighbouring countries are doing their utmost to support anyone in need, in particular those who are most at-risk including unaccompanied minors, single parent households, older people, and people with disabilities. They have the full support of IFRC and our global network, but more funding is desperately needed as millions of lives are at stake. Even if the armed conflict was to end tomorrow, the humanitarian consequences will be felt for years to come,” said Bischoff Ebbesen., Notes to editors, In Ukraine, Red Cross teams are providing first aid and first aid training, helping in reception centres and to transport people to safety, and distributing relief items, including warm clothes. Despite the mortal danger they themselves are under, 3,000 new local volunteers have stepped up to support their neighbours., In Hungary, Red Cross teams are operating three health service points at the border. They are also running reception and collection centres where they are welcoming people crossing from Ukraine and distributing relief goods., In Poland, where 60 per cent (more than a million) of people from Ukraine are fleeing, the Polish Red Cross has activated more than 20 rescue teams, including approximately 450 medics, who are providing round-the-clock health care and psychosocial support at five of the eight border points as well as in major cities., In Moldova, volunteers and staff from Moldova Red Cross have provided support to approximately 200,000 people who have crossed over from Ukraine. They are at all border crossing points offering hot tea, warm food, diapers, and personal protective equipment including face masks and sanitizer. Volunteers are also helping at reception centres, assisting with food preparation and playing with children., In Russia, Red Cross teams have delivered 187 tonnes of aid including clothing, hygiene kits, baby products and household items. They are providing psychosocial support, have opened a mental health support hotline and, to date, have provided 756 consultations. More than 160 calls have come in to the restoring family links hotline., In Romania, volunteers and staff from the local Red Cross are at various border crossings distributing food items, water, basic necessities, hygiene products, and thousands of SIM cards to people in need. The Red Cross is helping local authorities in equipping reception centres with tents, bedding, food and hygiene and baby items.

Russian bombings of hospitals and healthcare,News and Press Release,AOAV,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",10 Mar 2022,"By Emily Griffith, On 9 March 2022, horrific images and testimonies emerged from Mariupol, Ukraine, of a maternity and children's hospital destroyed by a Russian airstrike. It is the third recorded instance of Russian explosive weapon use on hospitals since Putin's invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February 2022., Since Action on Armed Violence began recording the global casualties of explosive violence in 2011, we have recorded 12 incidents in which Russia has bombed hospitals. These attacks have resulted in 124 civilian casualties, 45 of whom were killed and 79 injured. Among these casualties have been at least eight women and six children, though the number is likely much higher. Ten of the 12 incidents of Russian explosive weapon attacks on hospitals have been targeted airstrikes, accounting for 84% (104) of civilian casualties., Hospital attacks have been a consistent and devastating feature of Russia’s air campaign in Syria, and this inhumane tactic is now being seen in Ukraine. Since Russia’s military engagement in Syria began in 2015, AOAV has recorded nine incidents of explosive weapon use by Russian forces on hospitals across Syria, killing 37 civilians and injuring 47. On the first day of Russia’s invasion into Ukraine, explosive weapons were used on a hospital. Since then, there have been two more targeted explosive weapon attacks on hospitals in Ukraine by Russian forces. Eight civilians have now been killed by Russian bombings of hospitals in Ukraine, and at least 32 civilians injured., According to AOAV data on State perpetrators of explosive weapon attacks on hospitals and healthcare facilities since 2011, Russia is second only to Syrian government forces in causing the highest numbers of civilian casualties from the bombing of hospitals., Below is a complete list of AOAV’s recorded incidents of Russian explosive weapon use on hospitals and healthcare:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/russian-bombings-hospitals-and-healthcare

Food and Nutrition",10 Mar 2022,"Team on ground regrouped; strengthened with surge personnel; Declaration of corporate scale-up response, Rome - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is rapidly scaling up its efforts to respond to urgent food security needs resulting from the unfolding war in Ukraine, focusing initially on livelihood-saving interventions for the most vulnerable smallholder farmers., FAO has a team of 81 experts in Ukraine – 76 national and 5 international members. Most have been redeployed to the west of the country, as part of UN coordination. Declaration of FAO corporate scale-up emergency procedures implies activation of fast track management procedures, and upscaling of the chain of command with appointment of a senior designate responsible official supported by an Emergency response manager, and a very experienced surge support team from FAO’s headquarters in Rome, moving into the country to join the team. FAO as leader together with WFP of the Humanitarian Food Security Cluster in Ukraine regrouping more than 40 organizations is now engaged with partners from the Ministry of Agriculture in an assessment of the impact of the war on the sector and resulting needs., FAO is pivoting its ongoing programmes to emergency response, continuing its longstanding commitment to the people of Ukraine, while ensuring safety of its staff. Mara Lopes, FAO Ukraine Emergency Response Manager, said the team is highly motivated, with colleagues keen to take on the new assignments to respond quickly to meet the needs of vulnerable farming families in rural areas., “We are working 24/7 to scale up. We are fully committed to staying and delivering for everyone affected and particularly the farmers and people deriving their livelihood from food and agriculture,” she said., The conflict is not only affecting food security in the country, but also forcing massive displacement, with likely serious impacts to food production and agriculture-based livelihoods, a key source of income in rural areas of Ukraine., $50 million needed over the next three months, FAO has just made an urgent request for immediate initial obviously minimal funding of $50 million to assist up to 240 000 most vulnerable rural men and women in the next three months and address the most pressing and urgent needs of rural communities. All told, the Food Security and Livelihoods Cluster, co-led by FAO, has appealed for $183.5 million to provide food aid and agricultural livelihoods support as part of the larger United Nations flash appeal., The funds aim to support smallholder farmers in the country to plant their fields, harvest their crop, save their livestock and keep producing food. Multi-purpose cash assistance will be provided to address urgent needs, and where needed and possible, combined with the provision of seeds, tools, and other agricultural inputs., About 30 percent (12.6 million people) of Ukraine’s population lives in rural areas (as of January 2021). Agriculture is key to Ukraine's economy and livelihoods of rural communities, accounting for 9 percent of GDP., Upcoming planting season, The coming weeks will be critical as farmers will need to prepare land for sowing vegetables in the middle of March. Likewise, between February and May, farmers need to start preparing land for planting wheat, barley, maize and sunflower. All efforts should be made to protect harvests and livestock., Population displacement, damage to agricultural infrastructure, lack of affordable agricultural inputs, and disruption to markets and food supply chains are likely to impact food security in both the short and longer term., Contact

Free the Data for Ukraine’s Children,News and Press Release,HRW,"Education
Logistics and Telecommunications",10 Mar 2022,"Opening Up Access to Educational Content Would Help Millions, Hye Jung Han
Researcher and Advocate, Children's Rights Division, Children’s lives and learning are at stake. On February 25, the day after Russia’s invasion, Ukraine’s Education Ministry announced “extraordinary holidays” and closed all schools across the country, with no notice of re-opening. The conflict instantly suspended the education of 5.7 million children between the ages of 3 and 17, many of whom had already missed out on months of education due to deadly attacks on schools in eastern Ukraine, or Covid-19 school closures. A million children have already fled the fighting in Ukraine, with many more scrambling for shelter within the country., If telecommunication providers within Ukraine and in countries receiving refugee children were to zero-rate designated educational websites—that is, to provide children free access to learning and psychosocial support, without charging them for data—they could help provide immediate relief for children who have been pulled out of their schools and homes to access some remote emergency education, now., Telecommunications providers should prioritize providing free access to the educational content already created by the Ukrainian Education Ministry for children to continue learning during Covid-19 school closures. For children who have lost safety and routine, helping them to finish what remains of their school year using familiar content in their own language is critical. Making access free would provide some relief for displaced and distressed parents. Telecommunication providers can also temporarily provide free access to select general educational resources, which would benefit not only children impacted by the crisis, but also children living in host countries and communities., To help people communicate with loved ones and search for life-saving information, the Ukrainian telecommunication regulator has temporarily released spare radio frequencies to mobile phone networks to relieve congestion, and, with Ukrainian telecommunications providers, launched domestic roaming services to ensure people can stay connected., In turn, more than twenty major European telecommunication providers have rapidly provided free connectivity services to refugees, including distributing pre-paid SIM cards on arrival and providing free international calls to Ukraine., These commendable efforts can be extended to help protect children’s education in the early stages of this emergency, as host countries work to ensure uprooted children’s access to school., Past and current humanitarian crises have taught the world that when children lose their access to education, they risk losing their futures. Telecommunication providers can help stop the hemorrhaging of children’s futures, today.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/free-data-ukraine-s-children

Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič is currently in Romania to meet with the authorities and coordinate EU support to help those arriving from Ukraine., The Commissioner has visited the border to Ukraine at the Siret crossing point to assess the situation on the ground. The Commissioner also visited the new EU civil protection logistics hub in Suceava where four truckloads of medicine for Ukraine arrived yesterday from Italy., To efficiently manage this exceptionally high amount of deliveries, logistical hubs have been set up in Poland and Romania with the support of the European Commission’s Emergency Response Coordination Centre. These hubs will gather the assistance offered by Member States and dispatch it to Ukraine., Today the Commissioner will meet with the Prime Minister of Romania, Mr Nicolae-Ionel Ciucă, the Minister of Internal Affairs and State Secretary, Mr Lucian Bode, and the Head of the Romania Emergency Situations Inspectorate, Mr Raed Arafat., All 27 EU Member States, plus Norway and Turkey, have now offered help to Ukraine via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The assistance includes over 80 million items such as first aid kits, shelter equipment, firefighting equipment, water pumps, power generators, and fuel., This is the largest ever activation of the Mechanism to date, and the EU keeps receiving new offers every day. Neighbouring countries Moldova, Poland and Slovakia have also requested assistance via the Mechanism in light of the large influx of people fleeing the war, and several EU countries have responded by offering shelter items, medicines, hygiene kits and power generators., Furthermore, the EU is allocating additional €3 million in humanitarian funding to Moldova. This new funding will support the Ukrainians forced to flee their country by providing winterisation items and shelters, protection services, transportation and access to healthcare, but also cash assistance., Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, said: “Europe is witnessing the worst humanitarian catastrophe since World War II. In this dark hour, we also see the generosity of European countries as they come together to support the people of Ukraine who have been dragged to this war against their will. The EU has been working around the clock to coordinate the emergency assistance via its Civil Protection Mechanism, with much of life-saving aid already having reached Ukraine. Despite the ongoing hostilities, our humanitarian partners in Ukraine are starting to scale up their operations to bring relief to the people most in need.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-eu-continues-providing-emergency-aid-commissioner-lenar-i-visits-romania

The Jesuit refugee house in Lviv welcomes displaced people as they look for a safe place to rest after days of travelling in dangerous conditions., Fr. Andrii Syvak SJ describes the situation: ""Currently, most people who come from Kiev, Kharkiv, Mariupol, Crimea, Kherson, Wolnovachy and other regions are women and children. Men usually come only to accompany their wives, children, sisters, mothers to a safe place. There are, however, some who are exempt from military service for various reasons. Most of these people are not planning to stay, but are looking for an opportunity to leave Ukraine, so the Jesuit refugee house in most situations is a transit point, where people can rest after their exhausting journeys. They come to eat, rest, wash, warm up and then move on."" Fr Syvak adds: ""It is worth noting that in recent days, due to the relatively safe situation in Lviv, the number of people who want to stay in Ukraine is increasing. These people are following information about how the situation is developing and intend to stay in Lviv as long as it is safe""., The Jesuit house in Lviv is able to accommodate about 35 people. We provide beds, food, and access to laundry and bathrooms for all. We also assist with clothing and medicine for those in need. We are trying to make people feel like they finally reached a safe place. We also accompany them with psychological and pastoral support, as many of them have relatives and friends in the area where hostilities are ongoing, which is a serious psychological burden for them., JRS has been present in Lviv since 2005. In 2008, it opened the safe house to welcome refugees arriving from Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Palestine, Afghanistan and other countries. Since December 2014, displaced people from the Crimean peninsula and from the regions of Donetsk and Lugansk began to arrive. All the people who sought shelter in Lviv were provided with accommodation, food, legal and spiritual-psychological assistance., JRS working with Jesuits in Lviv began preparing for the onset of further hostilities from Russia as early as December last year by storing food and basic medical supplies and getting alternative sources of heating and electricity. Support is now arriving from all across JRS and the Society of Jesus and we can effectively respond to the needs of the current situation.

IOM has also created a separate Flash Appeal solely for Ukraine based on its inputs into the inter-agency appeal.
As of 9 March, IOM has received approximately USD 45 million, which represents confirmed funding and is exclusive of USD 1 million from the Migration Emergency Funding Mechanism (MEFM) and USD 0.3 million in reallocated funds.* Intervention areas include: water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), shelter/non-food items (NFI), health (including mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS)), cash-based interventions, food security and livelihoods (including integration support), protection (including humanitarian transport), humanitarian border management (HBM), camp coordination and camp management (CCCM), the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), and logistics. IOM has also created a separate Flash Appeal for Ukraine based on its inputs into the inter-agency appeal., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a military operation in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region on 24 February. Since the start of the military operation, major attacks have been reported across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv. Russian troops have quickly expanded their presence across Ukraine, with military clashes ongoing in other major cities: Chernihiv (north), Kharkiv (north-east), Kherson (south), Mariupol (south -east), Mykolaiv (south), Odessa (south-west), Sumy (north), among other cities.
On 8 March 2022, the Russian Federation declared a ceasefire at 10:00 MSK. Four humanitarian corridors/evacuation routes have been established from Chenihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol but are yet to be utilized.
The towns of Bucha, Hostomel, Irpin, Makariv and Vorzel on the outskirts of Kyiv have recently witnessed increasingly intense fighting, hindering the humanitarian response. While 2,000 people have been evacuated from Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin, more than 4,000 people urgently need to be evacuated in hotspots outside Kyiv. As the railway track and bridge leading out of Irpin – around 25 km north-west of Kyiv – have been destroyed, people are evacuating on foot. Between 24 and 8 March, the OHCHR recorded 1,335 civilian casualties, including 474 people killed; these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OCHA).
The increasing intensity of the conflict has contributed to growing internal displacement and cross-border movement. As of 9 March, over 2.2 million people have left Ukraine and crossed into neighbouring countries. Of concern is the situation of TCNs, as there have been increasing reports of discrimination, xenophobia, and harassment against TCNs while trying to leave Ukraine as well as on the other side of the border. Additionally, more than 2,000 seafarers are stranded in Ukrainian waters unable to leave. All Ukrainian ports have been closed since the start of the Ukraine-Russian Federation conflict and embassies and consulates have been working to get affected crews out of the country.
Despite the growing operational and security challenges, IOM, UN agencies, and humanitarian partners are preparing to scale -up operations for whenever access and security allow for humanitarian operations to be rolled out in the hardest-hit areas.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-4-9-march-2022
Russia’s Bombing of Ukrainian Hospitals Directly Violates Geneva Conventions: PHR,News and Press Release,Physicians for Human Rights,Health,9 Mar 2022,"NEW YORK – Medical experts and human rights advocates condemn in the strongest terms Russia's reported bombing of a hospital's maternity ward and children's clinic in Mariupol, Ukraine on Wednesday. The following statement is attributable to Christian De Vos, JD, PhD, director of research and investigations at Physicians for Human Rights (PHR):, *""Physicians for Human Rights is appalled by Russia's bombing of a children's clinic and maternity ward in Mariupol, Ukraine and calls on the Russian Federation and President Vladimir Putin to end their military aggression in Ukraine, and to respect the inviolability of medical facilities as protected zones under international humanitarian law. *, *""Thirteen days into this unlawful invasion, the World Health Organization has verified at least 18 attacks on health care facilities in Ukraine, with reports of new attacks escalating by the day. These indiscriminate assaults on hospitals and other civilian objects are in direct violation of the Geneva Conventions. It is also a tactic Russia has honed in other wars. From Chechnya to Syria, Putin-led Russian forces have used the targeting of health care facilities and personnel as a weapon of war -- shamelessly violating international law, killing untold numbers of innocent civilians, and leaving tens of thousands in dire need of medical care. PHR data has traced at least 244 attacks on medical facilities to Russian or Syrian government forces since 2011. *, ""It's shocking to behold the wanton destruction the innocent people of Ukraine have faced since Putin's war of aggression began. They are tragically now experiencing the same fear and panic felt by Syrians, who have seen their cities, neighborhoods, and health care facilities systematically torn apart by the targeted bombings of Russian forces in partnership with the Syrian government over more than a decade of conflict. Russia's brutal history of consolidating power through military action is a clear warning -- these horrific attacks on civilians and critical health care infrastructure are a brazen and unambiguous violation of international humanitarian law.

Protect persons with disabilities in the Ukraine conflict,News and Press Release,Diakonia International Humanitarian Law Centre,Protection and Human Rights,10 Mar 2022,"Russia's invasion of Ukraine is having a devastating impact on all civilians, who have been killed, injured, and forced from their homes. The impact on the millions of civilians with disabilities will be particularly severe., The Diakonia International Humanitarian Law Centre calls on parties to the conflict and the international community to ensure that persons with disabilities receive equal protection from the harms of this conflict and are included in humanitarian responses. Persons with disabilities must also be included within the accountability mechanisms that we hope will follow this unlawful act of aggression., Persons with disabilities in Ukraine are exposed to an elevated risk of harm. They will face significant and multiple barriers in fleeing violence and accessing humanitarian support. Most shelters are not accessible for wheelchair users and those with mobility impairments forcing people to remain in their homes as attacks continue. Evacuation procedures, transport and information are not accessible, meaning many are denied an opportunity to flee. Audio warnings are not accessible for persons who are deaf. Emergency information is not provided in easy read and other formats that are accessible to persons with intellectual impairments., Right to equal protection, Those that do not flee -- either by choice or because they have no option -- face an increased risk of death and serious injury. As civilian infrastructure is destroyed, the support that persons with disabilities, including medical, rehabilitation and social-care support, will disappear. Their family and other support systems on which they rely are at risk of being lost. As recent media reports have highlighted millions of persons with disabilities across Ukraine are at risk of being abandoned as those within their support networks flee. As we saw during the COVID-19 pandemic, those that live in congregated living settings, including institutions, are at increased risk of isolation, abandonment, and potential abuse., All parties to the conflict must adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law, which serves to limit the harmful impact of conflict. Civilians and civilian objects are protected and must never be targeted. Attacks must be proportionate and the harm to the civilian population -- which includes persons with disabilities -- considered. Disproportionate attacks are prohibited and may amount to war crimes. Indiscriminate weapons, including cluster munitions are prohibited and must not be used. All feasible precautions to protect the civilian population should be taken, including accessible warnings before attack, and accessible shelters and emergency information. As affirmed by Article 11 of the CRPD and reiterated in UNSC Resolution 2475 (2019), persons with disabilities have a right to equal protection in conflict situations, including under the protections of IHL., Inclusion in humanitarian support, For those that reach the boarder and seek safety in neighbouring countries, checkpoints and immigration controls should be accessible. This should include the provision of information in accessible formats, including easy read and audio, and persons with disabilities must be able to pass through with their personal assistance and any assistive devices or support animals they use., As the international community responds to the invasion with humanitarian support, persons with disabilities must be included in the design, roll-out and monitoring of humanitarian support and international standards, including the IASC Guidelines on Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in Humanitarian Action should be adhered to., All monitoring and accountability mechanisms, including the investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the soon to be established Independent Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine should include the disability dynamics of the conflict within their investigations, including potential war crimes and crimes against humanity against persons with disabilities., The Diakonia International Humanitarian Law Centre stands ready to provide technical support to stakeholders on all the issues raised in this statement.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/protect-persons-disabilities-ukraine-conflict
Asylum Access calls on the international community to protect those fleeing Ukraine,News and Press Release,Asylum Access,Protection and Human Rights,10 Mar 2022,"Asylum Access is deeply concerned about the situation unfolding inside and outside of Ukraine. We stand with people fleeing the Russian aggression and everyone seeking safety and protection right now. As the Russian offensive continues to target civilian areas and Ukraine's infrastructure, over 2 million people crossed the borders to neighboring countries in 12 days---including 1 million children---while many more are being forcibly displaced inside the country., The United Nations predicts that 4 million people may flee Ukraine soon. With these large projected numbers, the need for protection and humanitarian assistance will grow exponentially, requiring a high level of coordination and cooperation internationally and at the local level in each receiving country., We commend the quick response by the European Union (EU) countries to open their borders to Ukrainians and the swift decision to offer immediate temporary protection to Ukrainians and third-country nationals or stateless persons benefiting from international protection in Ukraine and their family members. We hope for continuous solidarity and support for everyone fleeing as the humanitarian situation in the country continues to deteriorate. Individuals fleeing violence or persecution in their home countries must have equal access to their human rights, regardless of one's nationality. This includes, but is not limited to, freedom of movement, the right to safe, dignified work, and access to education and healthcare. We encourage EU countries to implement an inclusive approach by extending protection to all people seeking safety and ensuring that their human rights are respected., We support the overwhelming vote and the United Nations General Assembly's resolution to condemn the Russian aggression against Ukraine. Countless human rights violations have stemmed from the Russian invasion. Asylum Access endorses the UN Human Rights Council's decision to form a commission of inquiry to investigate human rights violations, especially those committed near the borders against families trying to exit Ukraine., The escalation in violence is tearing families apart, forcing impossible decisions about who will flee and who will stay behind. While many parents stay behind to fight, children are escaping to neighboring countries with a single parent or unaccompanied. As many families remain stranded inside Ukraine, we implore the Russian forces to spare civilian areas and humanitarian corridors from the violence and provide a safe passage for individuals and families to seek safety in neighboring countries., We must keep in mind the human cost of this conflict, and all conflicts worldwide as civilian casualties and numbers of forcibly displaced people continue to rise. Wars are a turning point in the lives of humans who are drawn into them and a long-term traumatizing experience. As individuals seek safety for themselves and their families, we must be prepared to support them in a swift, holistic, and welcoming manner that preserves their dignity, protects their human rights, and mitigates the damage forced upon them by this violent aggression., If you need advice on seeking safety outside Ukraine, please see this list of resources that we have compiled. Where one chooses or is forced to flee is complex, and though we do not advocate for any particular destination, if you find yourself in Malaysia, Thailand, or Mexico, Asylum Access is ready to help you.

Communiqué on Women and Girls in Ukraine,News and Press Release,UNESCO,Protection and Human Rights,8 Mar 2022,"In its landmark Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (2000), the United Nations Security Council calls on ""all parties to armed conflict to take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence, particularly rape and other forms of sexual abuse, and all other forms of violence in situations of armed conflict."", Twenty-two years later, on International Women's Day, UNESCO is deeply concerned at the devastating escalation of violence in Ukraine, which threatens the safety and protection of women and girls across its fields of competence., In education, first of all, the current situation in Ukraine is endangering the lives and futures of the country's 7.5 million children, both girls and boys, who are now without access to learning. As we have seen with the COVID-19 pandemic, educational disruptions put a high number of girls at risk of never returning to school. UNESCO stands with education institutions to ensure that girls and women do not pay the price of this conflict with their future., In this conflict, women journalists are also under threat. UNESCO recalls UN Security Council Resolution 2222, which not only acknowledges the specific risks faced by women journalists, media professionals and associated personnel in carrying out their work, but also underlines the importance of considering the gender dimension of measures to address their safety in situations of armed conflict. UNESCO is monitoring worrying reports of women journalists being beaten, detained and threatened., In addition, UNESCO is responding to the cultural community's appeal for solidarity to protect artists and cultural workers in Ukraine, including their freedom of artistic expression. Women artists and cultural workers need urgent access to emergency resources such as safe havens for themselves and their artistic works. UNESCO deeply regrets reports of damage to the works of the celebrated Ukrainian artist, Maria Primachenko, with whose anniversary UNESCO was associated in 2009. UNESCO is mobilized to ensure that this does not happen again., Ukrainian women scientists who are dedicating their life to finding solutions to some of the most pressing issues, such as the climate change expert Svitlana Krakovska, have had to withdraw from negotiations on the impact of global warming. UNESCO has celebrated the achievements of some of these scientists throughout the years - such as the mathematician Olena Vaneeva who was nominated UNESCO/L'Oréal International Rising Talent in 2020 - and will continue to stand by their side., The critical voices of women journalists, educators, artists and scientists are the bedrock of society and democratic discourse. They are essential to preserve peace, to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms. Yet, their unique role is also what makes them a priority target of narratives of hate, dominance, and destruction., As we celebrate International Women's Day this year, UNESCO is committed to the protection of women and girls across the globe. Equality is a universal cause and an everyday imperative, in times of peace and in times of conflict. Today more than ever, we must show that we are equal to these challenges.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/communiqu-women-and-girls-ukraine

Approximately 2 million refugees have crossed the borders into countries neighbouring Ukraine. The Red Cross’ focus will be on providing aid to vulnerable people, including unaccompanied minors, single women with children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. Besides providing immediate relief aid, the focus is also on addressing basic needs, emergency shelter, protection, health, water, sanitation, hygiene, and psychosocial support. (Details in Annex A), This disbursement follows SRC’s first tranche of aid worth US$100,000, which arrived in Ukraine on 4 March, and was distributed by the Ukrainian Red Cross Society (URCS) and the IFRC as part of their ongoing response. Local branches of URCS, URCS Emergency Response Teams are organising collection points for the distribution of food, clothing, blankets to social institutions and Internally Displaced People (IDP). Besides these, they are supporting evacuation and transition points by evacuating the casualties and civilians, providing support to fire brigades, offering relief aid, rendering psychological first aid and providing information support to mothers, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities., An Outpouring of Support from the Community, In Singapore, donations to the SRC fundraising appeal (25 February to 31 May 2022) have reached close to S$3 million.

Ukraine: Russian ‘dumb bomb’ air strike killed civilians in Chernihiv – new investigation and testimony,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,9 Mar 2022,"Attack on March 3 killed people as they queued for bread, Lethal air strike may constitute a war crime, A Russian air strike that reportedly killed 47 civilians in the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv may constitute a war crime, Amnesty International said today following an investigation into the attack., At approximately 12.15pm on Thursday 3 March, the small public square formed by Chernihiv’s Viacheslava Chornovola and Kruhova streets was hit by multiple bombs, killing civilians and severely damaging nearby buildings., Based on new interviews and the verification and analysis of video evidence, Amnesty International’s Crisis Response team has concluded the attack was mostly likely a Russian air strike in which at least eight unguided aerial bombs – known as ‘dumb bombs’ – were used., “The air strike that hit the streets of Chernihiv shocks the conscience. This was a merciless, indiscriminate attack on people as they went about their daily business in their homes, streets and shops,” said Joanne Mariner, Amnesty International’s Crisis Response Director., “This shocking attack is one of the deadliest that the people of Ukraine have endured yet. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court should investigate this air strike as a war crime. Those responsible for such crimes must be brought to justice, and victims and their families must receive full reparation.”, The Chernihiv Regional Administration reported that 47 people (38 men and nine women) were killed in the strike. Verified footage of the strike shows eight munitions being dropped in close succession and falling in a line, as is typical in a bombing run., Amnesty International was not able to identify a legitimate military target at, or close to, the scene of the strike. Satellite imagery from 28 February shows a queue of people outside the building that was impacted by the strike. Based on this imagery and testimony gathered from witnesses, Amnesty International believes the majority of victims were queuing for food when the missiles struck., ‘Everything was destroyed’, When the bombs struck, Alina, a 21-year-old student, was in her home on nearby Ivana Bohuna Street with her family., She told Amnesty International: “I heard a very, very loud buzzing, and I felt our building shaking. It was as if our flat was inflating… And then after two seconds, I heard the windows get blown out into the courtyard. Our building shook a lot; I thought there would be no walls left., “When I heard the buzz, I called my grandma into the corridor with me. We laid on the ground and that’s likely what saved us.”, Alina’s parents were in the street when the blast happened, and they survived the attack. She added: “At [a nearby] yellow building, there had been a line for bread, and that’s where they had wanted to go… I don’t remember whether it was my mother or my father, one of them said, ‘No the line is too long, let’s go.’ And so they left. The people who were in that line are no more.”, Yulia Matvienko, a 33-year-old mother-of-three, was at home with her children, also on Ivana Bohuna Street, when the attack happened., She suffered a head injury, telling Amnesty International: “I was walking along the corridor and hadn’t even made it into the kitchen when I was suddenly deafened – I didn’t understand what was happening., “Everything started to suddenly crumble and fall. The children screamed. For several seconds, it was like there was silence and time stood still. Then I dragged my children out from under the rubble. Blood was flowing down me, and I dragged my children out., “Everything was destroyed, and the door [to their building] was knocked off. Not a single window was left, and some balconies were totally torn off. There is not a scratch on the children. It’s a miracle… [there was] only my blood on them.”, In dashcam footage of the strike, falling munitions are visible and the sound of what is likely a low quick-passing aircraft can be heard, consistent with the tactics of conducting a strike of this type. Dropping unguided bombs in populated areas violates the prohibition of carrying out indiscriminate attacks. Such bombs have wide-area effects and are far less accurate than precision-guided munitions., Crisis Evidence Lab verification, Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab verified footage of the aftermath of the strike that showed damage to buildings and bodies in the street. Footage from the State Emergency Service of Ukraine also showed damage and the rescue effort., Other verified videos of the aftermath show widespread destruction and at least one distinctive bomb crater, of a size consistent with surface impacted munitions of approximately 500kg., Other verified content from another air strike location in Ukraine shows an unguided dud FAB-500 M62 bomb being removed by civil defence forces. In addition, an official video released by the Russian military on 6 March shows the sortie launch of Su-34 Fullback aircraft loaded with eight FAB-500 bombs, an indicator of the typical combat load in current Russian operations., “All states should cooperate with the ICC and the new Commission of Inquiry established by the UN Human Rights Council to help ensure accountability for grave violations and crimes such as this attack. Victims of this conflict must have justice,” said Joanne Mariner., Amnesty International has previously called for international humanitarian and human rights law to be respected by all parties as the conflict in Ukraine continues.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russian-dumb-bomb-air-strike-killed-civilians-chernihiv-new-investigation-and

From 24 February to 8 March the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) verified 516 civilian deaths, including 37 children, and hundreds of people injured. OHCHR has warned that the actual death toll is undoubtedly much higher. According to the World Health Organization, at least 20 attacks on healthcare facilities, workers and ambulances have been recorded. Deliberate attacks against civilians and healthcare, as well as the use of indiscriminate weapons in civilian areas, are forbidden under international law and may amount to war crimes and/or crimes against humanity., More than two million people have fled so far, with millions more trapped or unable to flee. On 6 March Russian forces repeatedly shelled an intersection on an evacuation route in the city of Irpin, killing eight people, including two children. Although Ukrainian and Russian forces agreed on humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to flee from besieged cities like Kharkiv, Mariupol and Sumy, shelling has continued. On 8 March Russian forces reportedly shelled designated evacuation routes in Mariupol, leaving hundreds of thousands trapped without food and water., On 7 March the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, said that, “simply put, millions of lives shattered… even as the TV cameras roll, many can’t flee in safety… It’s been 11 days of escalating violence, fear and pain.” Griffiths alerted that UN agencies are unable to meet growing humanitarian needs., The international community has continued to rapidly respond to the crisis. On 3 March representatives of the International Criminal Court arrived in Ukraine to begin the Court’s investigation of the situation. On 4 March the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate systematic violations and abuses of human rights and International Humanitarian Law. On 7 March the International Court of Justice held its first hearing in the case Ukraine brought against Russia under Article IX of the Genocide Convention., Amidst the ongoing conflict, member states must continue to assist refugees, as well as support aid delivery and the evacuation of civilians. The UN General Assembly should suspend Russia from its seat on the HRC for violating its fundamental responsibilities as an HRC member. The UN Security Council must work on an agreement ensuring safe passage and the delivery of humanitarian aid in conflict affected areas. Parties to the conflict should reconvene ceasefire talks and adhere to agreed-upon humanitarian pauses., TATMADAW ALLEGEDLY PREPARING “KILL ALL, TORCH ALL” CAMPAIGN IN SAGAING REGION, Since October 2021 Myanmar’s (Burma) military – the Tatmadaw – has concentrated its ongoing scorched earth campaign in Sagaing Region, as well as other areas with strong opposition. On 7 March local media reported that the military may have plans to escalate its offensive and launch a so-called “kill all, torch all” campaign in Sagaing Region. News reports indicate that clashes have broken out daily in Sagaing Region in recent weeks and that the military allegedly wants to eliminate all resistance in the region before the annual Armed Forces Day on 27 March., The Tatmadaw has recently escalated its raids on villages in Sagaing Region, including with air strikes, the torching of civilian infrastructure and killing of civilians. In February alone the military killed at least 47 civilians suspected of supporting armed resistance groups in seven of the region’s townships. On 26 February a large group of civilians, including at least 80 children, were detained amidst clashes with local resistance groups in Chin Pone village in Yinmabin township, Sagaing Region. The Tatmadaw allegedly detained the civilians as human shields against a counterattack from a local armed resistance group. The use of human shields is a violation of International Humanitarian Law and a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court., Amidst the intensifying assault, the region’s internet blackout has been expanded, cutting internet access “indefinitely” to all of Sagaing Region’s 34 townships, except for four urban centers. Communities are becoming isolated and residents have reported that the lack of internet access has limited their capacity to flee and avoid the military’s raids., Liam Scott, Research Associate at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, stated that, “the military has already cracked down especially hard on Sagaing Region, so a major offensive would be devastating for the region’s civilian population. The ‘kill all, torch all’ rhetoric presents a grave warning that the military is preparing to indiscriminately target civilians and civilian infrastructure.” To limit the Tatmadaw’s capacity to perpetrate atrocities in Sagaing Region and throughout the country, the UN Security Council should urgently impose an arms embargo on Myanmar, and member states should immediately impose sanctions on Myanmar’s oil and gas sector., DOZENS KILLED AS ATROCITIES CONTINUE IN CENTRAL MALI, On 4 March the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali (MINUSMA) announced the opening of an investigation into allegations that at least 35 people were killed in Diabaly commune, Ségou Region. A video circulating on social media last week shows dozens of burned bodies with their eyes blindfolded and hands bound together. Some of the victims appear to have holes in the back of their heads. According to a local official, the bodies were found on 1 March and are believed to be people who were arrested earlier by Malian soldiers. The Malian Armed Forces have denied allegations of their role in the killings and announced their own investigation into the situation., Malian defense and security forces have been fighting Islamist armed groups in Diabaly for years. Fulani villages in central Mali have frequently been targeted and persecuted due to their perceived support for Islamist armed groups. Although Islamist armed groups and community self-defense militias are the primary sources of violence and insecurity in central Mali, defense and security forces have also committed atrocities. The UN has previously accused Malian soldiers of war crimes, including targeted killings, torture and rape, during the decade-long crisis in the country., Despite counterterrorism and military operations, the security situation in Mali has continued to deteriorate. The center and north of the country are marked by increasing attacks targeting civilians and peacekeepers. Following a visit to the country in February, Alioune Tine, UN Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Mali, emphasized that, “the international and African community must recognize the need to rethink security responses in the Sahel and I call for the development of more integrated security strategies, focused on the protection of civilian populations and their fundamental human rights.”, MINUSMA is one of the largest and most dangerous UN peacekeeping operations, with 154 peacekeepers killed in hostile acts since 2013, including 20 in 2021. On 7 March two peacekeepers were killed by a roadside bomb in central Mali. Targeting UN peacekeepers may constitute war crimes under international law., It is essential that the Malian transitional authorities ensure their operations against Islamist armed groups do not further exacerbate inter-communal tensions and are undertaken in strict compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law. Malian authorities, with the support of MINUSMA, must increase their security presence in central Mali and strengthen capacity to prevent future atrocities. All attacks against civilians and MINUSMA must be properly investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice. Ending the current climate of impunity is crucial.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/atrocity-alert-no-291-ukraine-myanmar-burma-and-mali

All parties must ensure the safety and protection of all civilians., With great concern, Berghof is witnessing a growing militarisation and war rhetoric. We strongly oppose this development. The war in Ukraine is a serious setback for peace., We get that with the anger over the brutal and unprovoked assault, plus the need to bolster security, many people are not prioritising negotiations at the moment. This is understandable but also a mistake. True security cannot come from military capability alone. For that, there has to be a negotiated settlement all sides can live with.

Recommendations of the OSCE Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings (SR/CTHB) on the need to enhance anti-trafficking prevention amid mass migration flows,Manual and Guideline,OSCE,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",10 Mar 2022,"OSCE States need to strengthen anti-trafficking prevention measures amid humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, VIENNA, 10 March 2022 – Unprecedented numbers of people seeking refuge from armed violence in Ukraine are arriving in many OSCE participating States. These people, mostly women and children, face risks of human trafficking, including sexual and labour exploitation, during their journey or upon arrival in a destination country. In light of the vulnerabilities of these people, the Office of the Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings today issued a set of concrete recommendations for countries to prevent trafficking., The recommendations contain guidance to address the needs of people seeking refuge, as well as policy measures to prevent and mitigate their vulnerabilities. They also look at longer-term challenges like integration into host communities from the perspective of preventing exploitation., Recommendations include:, Providing housing and immediate assistance like food and clothing;, Establishing information centres and hotlines that can give clear official information on registration, residence, and rights in a language refugees understand;, Introducing immediate measures to inform people seeking refuge of the risks of human trafficking, including “too good to be true” transportation, housing and job offers along migration routes and in vicinity of reception facilities and online., Disseminating official information broadly and monitoring for misleading information on housing and employment opportunities to prevent trafficking and fraud;, Furthermore, States are recommended to grant temporary residence permits, access to the job market, education for children, and ensure family preservation and reunification by not separating children from their parents. Reception facilities should be distributed across countries to avoid overburdening assistance and support systems in certain areas. Finally, States should also establish clear procedures for exchanging information on people seeking refuge to prevent people, especially children, from going missing., “We need to prevent the current humanitarian crisis from turning into a human trafficking crisis,” said the OSCE Special Representative for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings Valiant Richey. “Establishing prevention measures and addressing vulnerabilities of people seeking refuge should be a priority right now and is the focus of our recommendations.”, The complete set of recommendations is available on the OSCE website: www.osce.org/cthb/513784, The Special Representative continues to monitor the humanitarian situation and will be traveling to the border areas of the neighbouring countries to assess the situation on the ground and assist OSCE participating States on issues related to trafficking in human beings., Contacts, Lilia Rotoloni

Guidance for protecting displaced and refugee children in and outside of Ukraine,Manual and Guideline,UNICEF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",10 Mar 2022,"How authorities and aid workers can help keep children displaced by the war in Ukraine safe from trafficking and other forms of exploitation and abuse., The war in Ukraine has forced people to flee their homes by the millions – some seeking safety in other parts of the country, others taking refuge in neighbouring nations. Roughly half of those displaced are children. Among them, many are unaccompanied or have been separated from their families., Children on the move in and outside of Ukraine are at heightened risk of violence, exploitation and abuse., What risks do children displaced by the war in Ukraine face?, Are any of these children unaccompanied?, What’s happening to children in institutional care?, What about the risk of trafficking?, How can volunteers and Good Samaritans help protect children from trafficking?, How should institutions and care facilities in Ukraine move children to safety?, What should neighbouring countries do to protect unaccompanied children?, What about adoption?, What are Blue Dots?, What is UNICEF doing to protect displaced children and their families?, 1. What risks do children displaced by the war in Ukraine face?, Whenever children are driven from their homes by conflict, their exposure to danger escalates. In addition to the risk of being injured or killed by weapons and explosive munitions, displaced children face numerous challenges in transit. As fighting intensifies, they have few – or no – options to move through safe pathways, whether on their own or with their families. They may be caught up in violence, while cut off from essential medical care, clean water and food. They may be subjected to human trafficking, forced into child labour, or exposed to aggravated smuggling. Displaced women and girls are especially at risk of gender-based violence when sheltering or seeking asylum., The war in Ukraine is exacting a harrowing toll on children. UNICEF is on the ground in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, scaling up life-saving support for children and their families., >>Read: War in Ukraine poses immediate threat to children, 2. Are any of these children unaccompanied?, Many children on the move in and outside of Ukraine are unaccompanied or have been separated from their parents and family members. Nearly 100,000 children in Ukraine were living in institutions – residential care and boarding schools – when the crisis escalated. Almost half of these children live with disabilities., Children without parental care are at heightened risk of violence, abuse and exploitation. When these children are moved across borders, the risks multiply. The risk of trafficking also soars in emergencies., >>Read: How UNICEF protects children separated from their families during crisis, 3. What’s happening to children in institutional care?, Nearly 100,000 children, half of them with disabilities, live in institutional care and boarding schools in Ukraine. Many of these children have living relatives or legal guardians., As institutions seek to move children to safety in neighbouring countries and beyond, it is critical that special measures be taken in the best interest of the children, and that the consent of their parents or persons responsible for their care be granted. Moving children to safety must not hinder their prospect for family reunification in the future. Under no circumstances should families be separated as a result of relocation or evacuation movements., 4. What about the risk of trafficking?, As families transit to and through neighbouring countries in search of safety, they may find it difficult to identify trustworthy help. Volunteers have turned out by the thousands to support refugees at border crossings and guide them to protection. But the outpour of care, especially among unregistered volunteers, also provides cover to violent and unlawful groups, like traffickers, posing as Good Samaritans., Many refugees – the vast majority, children and women – arrive in neighbouring countries under unthinkable duress. They are hungry, exhausted and distressed. They may not speak the local language. And amid the chaos and confusion, they may be unknowingly approached by traffickers or other groups seeking not to connect them to essential services (like government registration, shelter, health care, education and more), but to exploit them., Children who are unaccompanied or who have been separated from their families are particularly vulnerable to trafficking. For women and girls, especially those travelling on their own, gender-based violence, which includes trafficking for sexual exploitation, is a real and harrowing danger., The risks of abduction, trafficking for sale and exploitation, and illegal adoption of children may be even greater where there are pre-existing child rights violations or large numbers of people crossing borders., 5. How can volunteers and Good Samaritans help protect children from trafficking?, Volunteers in and around host communities have turned out by the thousands to welcome refugees and guide them to safety. Many are unregistered, acting in goodwill to link families to government registration and other critical services. But the outpour of help at border crossings also provides cover for traffickers and other predators seeking to exploit women and children fleeing war. For refugees under unthinkable duress, especially unaccompanied children, distinguishing Good Samaritans from traffickers can be impossible., If you’re an unregistered volunteer providing assistance, follow these protection guidelines should you encounter a child who is alone:, 6. How should institutions and care facilities in Ukraine move children to safety?, Under specific circumstances, humanitarian evacuations of institutions providing residential care are necessary to bring children to safety. Those legally responsible for children in institutions in Ukraine must ensure that such evacuations are done in line with national authorities’ instructions. The Government of Ukraine has issued clear directives to all child-care facilities, including residential care and boarding schools, on how to organize necessary evacuations. Movements must be reported to competent authorities in Ukraine and neighbouring countries immediately upon crossing the border, and, as far as possible, children should be evacuated with their identification papers and case files., To provide maximum protection, UNICEF calls on all those legally responsible for children in institutional care to:, 7. What should neighbouring countries do to protect unaccompanied children?, UNICEF, together with UNHCR, urges all neighbouring and impacted countries to ensure the immediate identification and registration of unaccompanied and separated children fleeing from Ukraine, after allowing them access to their territory., For children who have been displaced across borders without their families, temporary foster or other community-based care through a government system offers critical protection. Adoption should not occur during or immediately after emergencies. Every effort should be made to reunify children with their families when possible, if such reunification is in their best interest., To protect all children from exploitation and abuse, States should offer safe spaces for families, immediately following border crossings, and link these to national child protection systems. The current emergency also necessitates rapidly expanding the capacity of emergency care arrangements with screened caregivers, as well as other critical services for the protection of children, including against gender-based violence, as well as family tracing and reunification mechanisms. This is crucial for unaccompanied and separated children who need temporary care while reunification efforts are underway. Per UNICEF guidelines, family-based and community-based care should be promoted in these circumstances, with institutional care being used only as a last resort and for the shortest duration possible., Specifically, neighbouring and impacted countries should:, 8. What about adoption?, Children separated from their parents during a humanitarian emergency cannot be assumed to be orphans and are not available for adoption. For this reason, adoption should not occur during or immediately after emergencies. Until the fate of a child's parents or other close family members can be verified, each separated child – even those who were living in residential care before the war – is considered to have living close relatives. Every effort should be made to reunify children with their families when possible, if such reunification is in their best interest., Intercountry adoption should only be considered once all family tracing and reunification efforts have been exhausted and stable solutions in the child’s country, including kinship care and national adoptions, have been considered., Displacement in an emergency should not be used as justification for expediting adoption or circumventing international standards. Adoptions should always be made in the best interests of the child, with full respect for her rights., UNICEF supports intercountry adoption when pursued in conformity with the standards and principles of the 1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoptions. In an emergency situation, it can be near impossible to ensure that the standards and safeguards of the convention are respected. This escalates the risk of child abduction, sale, or trafficking, and of illegal adoptions., 9. What are Blue Dots?, Jointly set up by UNICEF and UNHCR together with local authorities and partners, 'Blue Dots' are safe spaces that provide children and families fleeing Ukraine with critical information and services. Blue Dots ensure families are aware of their rights as refugees and help them access health care, education, psychosocial support and more. They identify and register children travelling on their own and connect them to protection services. Blue Dots also offer referral services to women, including for gender-based violence., UNICEF, together with UNHCR and local authorities and partners, is scaling up Blue Dots in Moldova, Romania, Poland and Belarus to protect children on the move and others at risk of exploitation and abuse., 10. What is UNICEF doing to protect displaced children and their families?, UNICEF is working day and night to scale up our life-saving operations for children, both in and around Ukraine.

Additional UNICEF supplies on their way to Ukraine as number of child refugees exceeds 1 million mark [EN/RU],News and Press Release,UNICEF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",10 Mar 2022,"GENEVA/NEW YORK, 10 March 2022 – More than one million children have now fled Ukraine as war continues to ravage the country, UNICEF said today. Most have fled with their families to Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Moldova and Romania., “The number of children on the move is staggering, an indication of how desperate the situation for children and families in Ukraine has become,” said UNICEF Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia Afshan Khan. “Children are leaving everything they know behind in search of safety. This is heart-breaking.”, So far, 6 trucks carrying nearly 70 tons of supplies have arrived to Ukraine. The supplies include personal protection equipment and medical, surgical and obstetric kits., Working with partners, UNICEF teams in Ukraine will be delivering medical supplies to 22 hospitals in 5 different conflict-affected areas of Ukraine, to benefit 20,000 children and mothers., UNICEF renews its call for safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian access to reach populations in need, and for the safe passage of civilians to reach the services and protection to which they are entitled., Across the border, three trucks were dispatched from Copenhagen – UNICEF’s warehouse and the largest humanitarian hub in the world – carrying essential supplies, such as early childhood development, recreational and hygiene kits. These supplies have now arrived in Poland., Additional supplies are on their way from Copenhagen and from Turkey, and are due to arrive in the coming days., To assist children and families on the move from Ukraine to Moldova, Poland, Romania and Belarus, UNICEF has set up “Blue Dots,” one-stop safe spaces that provide key information to traveling families and the ability to identify unaccompanied and separated children and ensure their protection., UNICEF is appealing for US$ 349 million to prevent a further deterioration of the welfare of children in Ukraine and neighbouring countries and to enable the effective provision of critical life-saving support. This includes US$ 276 million for immediate needs within Ukraine and US$73 million in neighbouring countries., “We’re doing everything we can to help the children and families in need but the war must end.

"Those fleeing Ukraine conflict must be granted safe passage and international protection without delay, OSCE human rights head says [EN/RU]",News and Press Release,OSCE,Protection and Human Rights,7 Mar 2022,"WARSAW, 7 March 2022 – The OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) is alarmed that more than 1.7 million people have already fled Ukraine as a consequence of the Russian Federation’s military attack, with many others still trying to find safety by crossing international borders or moving inside the country. An increasing number of civilians are falling victim to what appears to be the indiscriminate use of explosive weapons in residential areas, which is prohibited by international humanitarian law., “Safeguarding civilian lives during a military attack is an obligation that must be met unreservedly and without delay. It is vital that safe passage is guaranteed to all civilians in need of protection, in line with the commitments made by every OSCE country, as well as the norms of international law,” said ODIHR Director Matteo Mecacci. “Failing to ensure safe passage for those in need will continue to cause immense suffering to innocent people.”, Due to the present crisis, hundreds of thousands of civilians are unable to move to safety or seek international protection. Particularly those in vulnerable situations such as the elderly, children, or people with disabilities, require particular attention and assistance to reach safety., ODIHR applauds the steps taken by many countries to open their borders to assist people fleeing Ukraine. Recognizing the immense challenge of dealing with a mass movement of this kind, more efforts and coordination are still needed. It is also crucial that such assistance is provided effectively and without discrimination to all those who need it, and to observe all obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law., All countries of the OSCE have recognized that the rights of people at risk of displacement or already affected by it “need to be effectively protected in all phases of the conflict cycle” (Vilnius 2011). OSCE countries have also committed to “promote dignified treatment of all individuals wanting to cross borders, in conformity with relevant national legal frameworks, international law, in particular human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law” (Ljubljana 2005)., Contacts, OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights

"Gender, Health, and the War in Ukraine",News and Press Release,Direct Relief,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",9 Mar 2022,"Women and girls face increased levels of gender-based violence and interruptions to maternal health care, among other grave risks., By Andrew Schroeder, Today, multiple press reports are confirming that a Russian missile struck a maternity and children’s hospital in the city of Mariupol, Ukraine. Staff and patients, including children, appear to be trapped under the rubble, and total casualty numbers are unknown., In addition to the obvious human rights violations of deliberately targeting a maternity and children’s hospital, the attack highlights several gendered risks facing civilians in the Ukraine crisis. At such a moment, it’s essential to think about the role that gender and health play in conflict situations, and how best to respond to related needs., DEMOGRAPHICS IN UKRAINE, Prior to the war, Ukraine had a demographic profile that was highly skewed by gender: The overall population was composed of 54% women to 46% men., That gendered disparity gets even wider when looking at the upper ends of the age distribution. Whereas the number of younger people in Ukraine leans slightly male, there is an extreme lean towards females in people above age 45., By far the greatest disparity occurs between men and women in their 70s and 80s. Ukrainian men tend to live shorter lives than Ukrainian women, which is reflected in the proportion of men and women over the age of 70 in the country. On average, women tend to outlive men in Ukraine by about 10 years., DISPLACEMENT, The refugee evacuations from Ukraine have likely altered this demographic picture somewhat. Of the 2 million people who have fled the country since the war started, roughly half are children under the age of 18, and men between the ages of 18 and 60 are essentially not permitted to leave the country, given the needs of the Ukrainian war effort., Men are far more likely to experience traumatic injuries because of combat, while women are more likely to face a host of other health risks and vulnerabilities. In part due to the highly skewed gender distribution of the Ukrainian population, the best current estimates from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees indicate that, prior to the conflict, nearly 60% of internally displaced persons within Ukraine were female. This surely continues to be the case today, and the number has likely increased somewhat during the conflict., As a result, it is entirely reasonable to suggest that the health needs of displaced persons, whether they are in Ukraine or have fled the country, represent the needs of women to a great degree., NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES, In addition to the issues of maternal health and gender-based violence, discussed below, it’s important to understand the problem of gendered differences in the incidence and risk factors of non-communicable diseases like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Differences in exposure to non-communicable diseases account for a significant amount of the overall gendered population disparity., For example, the World Health Organization published a report in 2020 on non-communicable diseases in Ukraine, looking in part at disparities in risk factors such as smoking, diet, physical activity, obesity, and blood pressure. Here’s what the gender distribution looks like by age group for men and women – specifically, their likelihood of having three or more significant risk factors:, These risk factors tended to be somewhat more extreme for women and men in urban versus rural areas. Differences by income were minimal, and middle-aged men had higher rates of alcohol consumption. However, the main difference is that Ukrainian men tend to die of non-communicable diseases at an earlier age than women do. Older Ukrainian women tend to live with the consequences and higher incidence of non-communicable diseases., MATERNAL HEALTH, Over the past 20 years or so, Ukraine has made significant progress in reducing the risks to women in childbirth. During that time, the maternal mortality ratio went from 35 to 19 people per 100,000., Access to and quality of health services increased steadily throughout Ukraine’s post-Soviet transition. The current maternal mortality rate places Ukraine at the bottom end of all countries in and around Europe, and roughly on par with the United States., According to estimates from the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere, roughly four percent of displaced people will be pregnant women, and 15% of those women will require emergency obstetric interventions., Applying that number to the current 2 million refugees who have left Ukraine, and estimating roughly another 1 million internally displaced persons based on pre-war reports, that would mean there are currently around 120,000 displaced pregnant women in and around Ukraine, with about 18,000 in need of emergency obstetric interventions., During the conflict, however, women are disproportionately at risk of being cut off to all aspects of quality maternal health throughout the entire cycle of care. On the most extreme level, women who were in the late stages of their pregnancies when the war in Ukraine started are now giving birth while displaced. Some have even given birth in bomb shelters, where they may lack not only skilled birth attendance but even the basic supplies required to give birth safely., It’s important to remember that many women in Ukraine, particularly those in eastern separatist areas, have been facing the consequences of conflict-related disruptions since 2019. The World Health Organization recommended prioritization for women in these situations as follows:, Improving access to reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health services for internally displaced persons and in the eastern regions affected by the crisis;, Increasing the capacity of health care providers working in Mobile Emergency Primary Units by updating and organizing trainings with the inclusion of maternal and child health modules; and, Strengthening services in emergency triage assessment and treatment of children., These recommendations continue to apply in the current situation and should expand in scope relative to the size of the conflict-affected population., Likewise, conflict tends to sharply reduce access to sexual and reproductive health services, while increasing women’s exposure to gender-based violence., GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE, According to a 2019 study by UNFPA, roughly 75% of Ukrainian women reported having experienced some form of violence prior to age 15, with 30% reporting direct physical or sexual violence., During situations of conflict and displacement, the risk of gender-based violence tends to increase dramatically. According to a 2020 Amnesty International report, Ukraine saw a severe increase in reports of domestic violence in separatist areas in 2018: 76% in the eastern region of Donetsk and 158% in Luhansk. These types of statistics are quite common in wartime situations, with reports of general violence against women, including rape and other forms of sexual abuse, increasing significantly., Likewise, reports by UN Women, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and others prioritize a focus on the human trafficking of women and girls, specifically as a result of forced displacement. This is because people tend to end up in difficult and insecure living situations over long periods of time due to conflict., Ukraine is, of course, not unusual – every conflict sees these trends of disproportionate exposure to risks for women and girls. But because of the scale of the Ukraine crisis, which has already displaced millions, it is essential to prioritize gender as a lens through which to view the health impacts of the war.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/gender-health-and-war-ukraine

While we can’t confirm that this was a targeted attack, we know from our staff that houses and hospitals have been damaged during the fighting over the past days. With active shelling, gunfights, and aerial bombardment in Mariupol ongoing, seeking health care has become increasingly hard, especially for expecting mothers and elderly people who are limited in their movements., Attacks on health structures destroy what little capacity is left to treat urgent cases. In a city, where the health system is close to collapse, depriving people of much-needed health care is a violation of the laws of war., People in Mariupol have been living through days of siege in agonizing conditions, and every new attack on civilian infrastructure adds to their utter desperation. It is imperative that civilians and civilian infrastructure including health facilities be spared from attacks, and people’s right to seek health care and safety be guaranteed.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-hospitals-must-not-be-attacked

Director, Crisis and Conflict, On February 25, Russian military forces reached the outskirts of Sumy, a city in northeastern Ukraine about 30 kilometers from the Russian border. By that evening, they had encircled the city, isolating it from the rest of the country., Two Sumy residents, Svitlana and Olexandr – pseudonyms for a woman and man – told Human Rights Watch on March 7 about the difficulties they face. Electricity, water, and heating services have been cut off in some areas, reportedly due to Russian bombing and shelling of the city’s infrastructure. Some residents have had to melt snow for drinking water, while others moved in with friends in other neighborhoods., Food stocks have dwindled as Russian forces have severed supply routes from Kyiv and Kharkiv. Svitlana and Olexandr said that shops near them are out of most goods and there was no meat, dairy, grains, or fresh produce, and heard the same from friends and family in other parts of the city. “There are only chocolates and juices and some very expensive products we can’t afford,” Svitlana said. They said they were unaware of any humanitarian relief getting into the city., Like many Sumy residents, Svitlana and Olexandr had no time to flee before the city was encircled. “I’ve heard of a few groups of people who tried to leave, but they came under fire and had to turn around,” Svitlana said. Both said they were affected by videos of Sumy residents being shot at while trying to flee in cars., On March 8, thousands of Sumy residents and foreign students were able to evacuate under the first organized ceasefire and evacuation in Ukraine since the war began. But many civilians remain in Sumy, including Svitlana, who did not want to leave her older parents behind, and Olexandr, who was worried his wife and children might come under fire during the evacuation., As Russian forces encircle more cities and towns across Ukraine, horrific reports of civilians lacking necessities are mounting. A 6-year-old girl reportedly died of dehydration in the southern coastal city of Mariupol this week. All warring parties must abide by their international legal obligations to facilitate civilians’ access to water, food, electricity, and medical care, and their ability to leave for safer places.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/trying-survive-besieged-ukrainian-city

At the time of writing, it remains unclear if the security conditions will permit these evacuations to take place., OCHA and the United Nations Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) have established an inter-agency operations cell, under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator and the recently appointed Crisis Coordinator, to facilitate the safe passage of humanitarian personnel and goods delivered by the humanitarian community into the hardest-hit areas., SITUATION OVERVIEW, As the situation enters its second week, the human cost of the conflict continues to mount. Between 4 a.m. on 24 February and midnight on 8 March, OHCHR reports at least 1,424 civilian casualties, including 516 killed., The steady, yet sharp increase witnessed in civilian casualties in the last two weeks is alarming. The number of civilians killed since 24 February already surpasses the 353 conflict-related civilian deaths recorded by OHCHR during six years of conflict in eastern Ukraine combined., In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, OHCHR reports 573 casualties (87 killed and 349 injured in Government-controlled areas, GCA, and 24 killed and 113 injured in non-Government-controlled areas, NGCA), while 851 civilian casualties have been confirmed in other regions of Ukraine. However, it is presumed that the actual numbers are likely much higher. OHCHR reports that the civilian toll remains incomplete pending corroboration of reports, adding that in cities and towns like Volnovakha, Mariupol (Donetska oblast, east), Izium (Kharkivska oblast, east) and other hard-hit areas, where there are allegations of hundreds of civilian casualties., The humanitarian situation in Ukraine becomes increasingly more dire with each passing day. While the roll-out of assessments is greatly restricted by lack of access and growing insecurity, the Humanitarian Country Team estimates that around 12 million people – nearly 30 per cent of the population – require life-saving humanitarian assistance., The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reports that more than two million people have been forced to flee to neighbouring countries for safety, while the most vulnerable people, those lacking the means to escape the conflict remain in Ukraine. Their unmet needs continue to accumulate and worsen by the hour. UNHCR further estimates that around 1 million people are newly displaced in Ukraine, although it is difficult to have an accurate estimate due to the ongoing situation., To ease human suffering and prevent the needless loss of human life, an immediate ceasefire must be negotiated. In the meantime, reliable and predictable windows of silence and safe passage are urgently needed to safely relocate conflictaffected people and deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance. So far, some 600,000 people have reportedly been evacuated from Kharkiv (east) by railway, according to the Kharkivska Oblast Administration. Additionally, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine reportedly evacuated more than 292,000 people, including over 61,000 children and nearly 1,300 people living with disabilities, to different parts of the country. Meanwhile, the Russian Federation reported it has so far evacuated around 179,000 people from Ukraine towards Russia., Early on 9 March, the Ukrainian Ministry of Reintegration confirmed that the Russian Federation agreed on six humanitarian safe passage routes to evacuate people from Enerhodar to Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast, south-east); Mariupol (Donetska oblast) to Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast, south-east); Volnovakha (Donetska oblast) to Pokrovsk (Donetska oblast); Izium to Lozova (Kharkivska oblast, south-west); from Sumy to Poltava (Poltavska oblast, central Ukraine); and the Kyiv oblast (Borodianka, Bucha, Hostomel, Irpin and Vorzel) to the city of Kyiv through Stoianka and Bilhorodka. At the time of writing, it remains unclear if the security conditions will permit these evacuations to take place, as police in the Kyivska oblast reported earlier today that a police officer was killed and two civilians injured by active hostilities during an evacuation in the town of Demydiv located north of the capital., On 8 March, around 5,000 civilians were reportedly evacuated from Sumy to Poltavska oblast. The Administration of Sumska Oblast says that safe passage for the evacuation of civilians will continue through 9 March, as the city and oblast of the same name, come under attack. Overnight on 8 March, nearly two dozen people were reportedly killed, including three children, after airstrikes rained down on the north-eastern city of Sumy – home to around 267,000 people., In Mariupol (Donetska oblast), humanitarian needs continue to accumulate as hundreds of thousands of people remain trapped in dire conditions for more than 10 days. On 8 March, the Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister announced that eight trucks and 30 buses were sent from Zaporizhzhya to Mariupol with humanitarian aid; however, at the time of writing, it remains unclear if the delivery arrived as shelling continued unabated. On 9 March, a children’s hospital in Mariupol reportedly came under direct attack resulting in severe damages; the number of casualties is yet to be confirmed., Recent safe passage for the evacuation of civilians and the delivery of humanitarian relief supplies to military encircled cities, like Mariupol, have been repeatedly postponed or even come under attack. Humanitarian organizations may attempt to reach affected people as fast as possible, however, uncoordinated humanitarian convoys hastily deployed are more likely to be to put civilians, humanitarian staff and relief goods at risk., On 8 March, a non-governmental organizations (NGO) convoy carrying life-saving humanitarian aid was reportedly destroyed after being caught in crossfire. OCHA and UNDSS have established an inter-agency operations cell, under the leadership of the UN Resident Coordinator/Humanitarian Coordinator and the recently appointed Crisis Coordinator, to facilitate the safe passage of humanitarian personnel and goods delivered by the humanitarian community into the hardesthit areas.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-9-march-2022

Update 16 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (9 March 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,9 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) had been disconnected from the electricity grid and lost its supply of external power, two weeks after Russian forces took control of the site of the 1986 accident, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., The Director General expressed deep concern about this development as the “secure off-site power supply from the grid for all nuclear sites” was one of seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security that he outlined at a meeting of the IAEA’s Board of Governors on 2 March, convened to address the safety, security and safeguards implications of the situation in Ukraine., In the case of the Chornobyl NPP, however, he said the IAEA agreed with the Ukrainian regulator that its disconnection from the grid would not have a critical impact on essential safety functions at the site, where various radioactive waste management facilities are located. Specifically, regarding the site’s spent fuel storage facility, the volume of cooling water in the pool is sufficient to maintain effective heat removal from the spent fuel without a supply of electricity. The site also has reserve emergency power supplies with diesel generators and batteries., Nevertheless, the lack of power is likely to lead to a further deterioration of operational radiation safety at the site and create additional stress for around 210 technical experts and guards who have not been able to rotate for the past two weeks, in effect living there around the clock, Director General Grossi added., “From day to day, we are seeing a worsening situation at the Chornobyl NPP, especially for radiation safety, and for the staff managing the facility under extremely difficult and challenging circumstances,” he said. “I repeat my urgent appeal to the forces in effective control of the plant to respect internal radiation protection procedures, to facilitate the safe rotation of staff and to take other important steps to ensure safety.”, In another development, he said the IAEA in recent days had lost remote data transmission from its safeguards systems installed to monitor nuclear material at the Chornobyl NPP and another Ukrainian nuclear power plant now controlled by Russian forces, the Zaporizhzhya NPP. He said he was concerned about the sudden interruption of such data flows to the IAEA’s Vienna headquarters from the two sites, where large amounts of nuclear material are present in the form of spent or fresh nuclear fuel and other types of nuclear material., The reason for the disruption in the transmission of safeguards data was not immediately clear. The IAEA continues to receive such data from other nuclear facilities in Ukraine, including the three other nuclear power plants., “The remote transmission of data from IAEA safeguards equipment located at nuclear sites around the world is an important component of our safeguards implementation, in Ukraine and globally,” he said. “Such systems are installed in several facilities in Ukraine, including all nuclear power plants, and enable us to monitor nuclear material and activities at these sites when our inspectors are not present.”, Even though technical features were in place to ensure that the data was stored locally, the storage capacity as well as the operational status of the monitoring systems remained uncertain, he said., Through safeguards technical measures the IAEA verifies that countries are honouring their international legal obligations to use nuclear material and technology only for peaceful purposes., Regarding the status of Ukraine’s operational nuclear power plants, the regulator said eight of the country’s 15 reactors remained operating, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP. Radiation levels at the sites were normal, it said., The Zaporizhzhya NPP site has four high voltage (750 kV) offsite power lines plus an additional one on standby. The operator informed the IAEA that two have been damaged and therefore there were now two power lines, plus the one on standby, available to the plant. The operator also said that the NPP off-site power needs could be provided with one power line available. Furthermore, diesel generators are ready and functional to provide back-up power. “Nevertheless, this is another example of where the safety pillar to secure off-site power supply from the grid for all nuclear sites has been compromised,” Director General Grossi said., In addition, the regulator reported that the Unit 6 transformer had been taken out of service and was undergoing emergency repair after damage to its cooling system was detected following the events of 4 March., These recent developments added to the IAEA’s growing concerns about the safety, security and safeguards impact of the conflict in Ukraine on the country’s nuclear facilities, including its four operating nuclear power plants as well as the Chornobyl site., As part of his new initiative regarding Ukraine, Director General Grossi said he will travel to Antalya tomorrow at the invitation of Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu. “In meetings there, I hope to make progress on the urgent issue of ensuring the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. We need to act now,” he said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-16-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-9-march-2022-enru

Ukraine: UN expert seriously concerned by housing rights violations,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,9 Mar 2022,"GENEVA (9 March 2022) – The UN Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, Balakrishnan Rajagopal, today expressed grave concerns about the serious violations of the right to adequate housing in Ukraine after Russian Federation forces invaded the country. He issues the following statement:, “Indiscriminate use of weapons such as cluster munitions, multiple launch rocket systems, tactical missile systems and artillery systems have been reported in multiple areas of Ukraine including in and around the cities of Chernihiv, Kyiv, Kherson, Mariupol, Okhtyrka, Zhytomyr and several others. Many homes, civilian infrastructure including fuel depots, water and power stations are under attack or threat of attack., These armed attacks come on top of an ongoing armed conflict between Ukraine Government forces and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine since 2014, which has already taken a heavy toll on civilians, including their homes and vital infrastructure, and has killed over 3,400 civilians, more than 10,000 combatants, and displaced over 1.5 million. More than 1.5 million people from Ukraine have now fled within 10 days into neighboring countries and an undetermined but large number have been internally displaced. Directly or indirectly, the aggression will have a massive toll on the access to and habitability of housing in Ukraine., I call for an immediate end to all violations of the right to adequate housing in Ukraine, which may amount to grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and crimes under international criminal law., The deliberate targeting of civilian housing and vital infrastructure is prima facie, a violation of international law of armed conflict and gives rise to individual and State responsibility for such acts. All feasible precautions should be taken to minimize harm to civilians, their housing and civilian infrastructure, avoid indiscriminate attacks that fail to distinguish between military and civilian objects and attacks that would cause disproportionate harm to civilians, their housing and infrastructure. The use of indiscriminate shelling of residential areas and use of cluster munitions is, by these standards, incompatible with international law. These provisions of international humanitarian law are applicable to the armed conflict in Ukraine as they are to previous conflicts such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq, where States used cluster munitions and attacked civilian housing and infrastructure. The failure to hold States accountable for these serious violations of international humanitarian law is undermining the very idea of rule of law., Any bombardment of civilian objects in cities or other densely populated areas must immediately stop. All parties to the armed conflict in Ukraine must minimize harm to civilians including their housing and infrastructure. The Russian Federation and Ukraine must take all feasible precautions to minimize or avoid such harm, and provide effective advance warning of attacks when such attacks are justified by military necessity. Military forces deployed in cities or densely populated areas must, to the extent feasible, avoid locating themselves near civilian objects, housing and infrastructure, and must avoid shielding behind civilian infrastructure or housing., Forced evictions and displacement are a severe violation of the right to adequate housing. In addition, the forcible transfer of population, whether by direct or indirect means, is a grave breach of the 1949 Geneva Convention, its first optional protocol of 1977, and a crime under the Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The armed forces of the Russian Federation are, in parts of Ukraine under their control, governed by the obligations that apply to occupying powers. This includes the obligation not to forcibly alter population ratios in specific areas by causing one of the largest mass exodus of people in Europe or transferring its own population into Ukrainian territory under occupation., Ukraine and the Russian Federation are parties to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, the 1977 Protocols, and major human rights treaties. While the Russian Federation is not a party to the Rome Statute establishing the ICC, Ukraine has accepted the jurisdiction of the ICC for all acts that occur on its territory. I welcome the announcement by the ICC that it has opened an independent investigation into the situation in Ukraine and I call on all States to cooperate with the court. Mass, indiscriminate or deliberate destruction of civilian housing are acts that incur liability under the Rome Statute and could potentially also be prosecuted by other States under the principle of universal jurisdiction., Ukraine and the Russian Federation are both parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which does not permit derogations during a State of Emergency or armed conflict. Thus all parties are under an obligation to respect, protect and fulfill the right to adequate housing even when armed conflict occurs. The right to adequate housing has at its core, the right to live in a home in peace, security and dignity. The hostilities have already resulted in a gross violation of this right, as several million civilians in Ukraine have fled their homes or are trapped or seeking shelter in basements, subway stations, bathrooms or other locations in constant fear for their life., Lastly, I strongly welcome the decision of EU countries to offer temporary protection to refugees fleeing Ukraine and the humanitarian assistance provided by many civil society organisations and States. I urge States to offer assistance to all victims of the gross violations of the right to adequate housing in Ukraine, including access to housing, physical and mental health care, education and livelihoods. Everyone fleeing this armed conflict should be offered safe passage, shelter, emergency housing and humanitarian support without any discrimination, irrespective of nationality, race, gender or age.”, ENDS, Mr. Balakrishnan Rajagopal is the UN Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context.

Two million people are reported to have left their homes into neighbouring countries, while countless more are trapped and desperate for a safe escape., The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been working in Ukraine since 2014 and continues to help those living through the conflict., “Teams from the ICRC have been delivering medical supplies, food, water and hygiene material in Kyiv, Mariupol, Odessa, Donetsk, Luhansk, and many other places. But it’s clear much more must be done to assist the skyrocketing number of people in need. That’s why we are mobilizing more staff and supplies to Ukraine and neighbouring countries, to help people suffering from the effects of this conflict,” said Martin Schüepp, ICRC’s regional director for Europe and Central Asia., Additional ICRC staff arrived in Ukraine this week to significantly scale up our work, including medical staff, weapons contamination specialists and other emergency team members. We are also sending teams to Hungary, Moldova, Poland Romania and Russia to support our regional response and coordinate with our partners from the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. The ICRC is also setting up logistical hubs in neighbouring countries to more efficiently send relief items into Ukraine, with local supply chains broken down., In addition to stepping up our operational response on the ground, we continue a sustained, bilateral and confidential dialogue with all sides on the conduct of hostilities as well as on the protection of the civilian population, reminding them of their obligations under international humanitarian law., From 22 February to 8 March, the ICRC in partnership with the Ukraine Red Cross Society (URCS), delivered:, Medical:, Medical items to the Regional Hospital of Intensive Care and children’s hospital in Mariupol., Medical assistance in several displaced people centres in Mariupol., Surgical materials to three main hospitals in Kyiv as a joint ICRC/URCS effort with MSF., 2.5 tons of insulin in Odessa, enough for 6,500 people for six months; insulin for 9,000 people in Dnipropetrovsk for three months., Psychosocial support to children, adults in basements and shelters in Kyiv, Severodonetsk and Slovyansk., More than 160 first-aid kits for use by the URCS and other authorities., Food, water, and relief items:, Food, water and hygiene items to 4,000 people in shelters in Mariupol., 500 food parcels and hygiene kits, along with drugs and shelter material, in Gorlovka., 7,000 litres of potable water to the municipality of Donetsk., Fuel to URCS so it could donate 750 aid parcels in Kurenivka, Obolon and Podil., Food items to residents in Schastia, Triokhizbenka, Novoaidar., 38,000 litres of bottled water for residents and health facilities around Donetsk., 2.5 tons of water and 50 tarpaulins to officials in Kirovsk for distribution., Food and shelter materials to nine villages around Donetsk to internally displaced people., Tools for water infrastructure repair teams in Donetsk., Safe water, fuel and tarpaulins for residents in Donetskiy., Assistance to LuhanskGas in Vrubivka to repair gas pipelines., Cash assistance of nearly 28,000 CHF ($30,000) to the URCS in Kramatorsk., Blankets, Mattresses and jerrycans to 3 shelters in Severodonetsk., $66,000 in cash assistance to the UCRS branch in Lukansk, Blankets, pillows and mats for internally displaced people in the region around Novoazovskyi, 200 tarpaulins and plastic sheeting in Luhansk, 4,900 kilograms of potassium permanganate used for water purification donated to the Vodadonbassa Pokrovsk., Assistance items for 7,000 people donated to an aid organization in Sviatohyrsk., Weapon contamination work:, A newly deployed ICRC weapons contamination team will help communities clear unexploded ordnance., A donation to URCS of 500 signs to mark out hazardous, UXO-contaminated areas., Multiple emergency “Risk Awareness and Safe Behavior” briefings for Red Cross volunteers and others.

IOM Assists Nearly 100 Third Country Nationals Fleeing War in Ukraine to Return Home,News and Press Release,IOM,Protection and Human Rights,9 Mar 2022,"Geneva – The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has helped almost 100 third country nationals (TCNs) from Tunisia, Ghana and Lebanon, who fled the war in Ukraine, to voluntarily return safely to their countries of origin., Among them were 77 Tunisians forced to flee to Romania and Poland, three Lebanese nationals who had moved to Romania and 17 Ghanaian students.Seven other students will leave for Ghana on Thursday., Since the start of the war,more than 2.2 million people including 109,000 TCNs have fled Ukraine.

Emerging Patterns of Civilian Harm in Ukraine,Analysis,CIVIC,Protection and Human Rights,9 Mar 2022,"Ukraine: Russia Shift in Warfare Tactics Is Resulting in Mass Civilian Casualties, Civilians have become a prime target of Russian Armed Forces following their invasion of Ukraine, according to an initial research and analysis published by Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC). As the conflict escalates, reports of attacks by Russian forces that appear to have been directed at civilian areas have multiplied, according to CIVIC‘s initial findings. Current trends indicate that relevant obligations defined by international humanitarian law are not being met and its provisions could have been violated., Following the launch of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC) has been monitoring civilian harm incidents from open-source information, including local and international news sources and information shared by local authorities and communities. The initial report offers examples of cases of civilian harm in cities such as Kyiv, Mariupol, Uman, Vuhledar, and Kharkiv, noting that significant civilian harm has been the result of “fighting in densely populated areas and from the use of non-precision weapons.”, The report also notes that increased fighting and shelling in and near populated and urban areas suggest a shift in warfare tactics used by Russia’s Armed Forces aimed at causing mass civilian casualties to break down the Armed Forces of Ukraine., “There is little doubt that the war in Ukraine will be a massive tragedy for civilians that the world will remember for years to come,” says Beatrice Godefroy, Director for Europe at CIVIC. “The situation for civilians in areas under constant shelling or under the control of Russian Armed Forces is particularly alarming. Those willing to flee are prevented to do so and those staying are at risks of being killed or being assimilated to combatants.”, As attempts to put in place evacuation and humanitarian routes continue to fail, the cumulative impact on civilians trapped in frontline cities while having limited or no access to basic services, live-saving information, and communications will increase. This combination of different civilian harms hampers the ability of civilians to self-protect, warn the authors of the report., Attacks on civilian infrastructure and dangerous sites such as hospitals and nuclear facilities pose also direct and indirect threats to civilians. “Strikes on gas pipelines or nuclear energy reactors can cause severe, long-term environmental and health consequences,” the report notes., Based on this initial research and analysis, CIVIC offers urgent recommendations to better protect the civilians in Ukraine from the devastating consequences of war. Among several recommendations, the first priority is an immediate “pause in hostilities for several days” to create an environment conducive to the safe evacuation of civilians present in areas under constant fighting and to allow the delivery of humanitarian assistance into these areas. CIVIC also calls Russian Armed Forces to immediately cease indiscriminate and targeted attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure and urge the international community to prioritize the protection of civilians in all their efforts in order to exert pressure on Russia., For more information, please contact:, In The Hague: Hajer Naili, Director of Communications: hnaili@civiliansinconflict.org, +33.06.03.50.53.93 / +1.917. 889.5982 (WhatsApp), In Washington, D.C.: CIVIC’s Global Media team: comms@civiliansinconflict.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/emerging-patterns-civilian-harm-ukraine
Update 15 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (8 March 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,8 Mar 2022,"Ukraine told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that it was becoming increasingly urgent and important for the safe management of the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) to rotate some 210 technical personnel and guards who have been working there since Russian forces took control of the site almost two weeks ago, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., In contrast to the current situation for staff at Ukraine’s operating nuclear power plants who are rotating regularly, the same shift has been on duty at the Chornobyl NPP since the day before the Russian military entered the site of the 1986 accident on 24 February, in effect living there for the past 13 days, the regulator said., The Ukrainian regulator added that the staff had access to food and water, and medicine to a limited extent. However, the situation for the staff was worsening. It asked the IAEA to lead the international support needed to prepare a plan for replacing the current personnel and for providing the facility with an effective rotation system., Director General Grossi has repeatedly stressed that staff operating nuclear facilities must be able to rest and work in regular shifts, stating this is crucial for overall nuclear safety. Their capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure is among the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security he outlined at a meeting of the IAEA’s Board of Governors on 2 March, convened to address the safety, security and safeguards implications of the situation in Ukraine., “I’m deeply concerned about the difficult and stressful situation facing staff at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and the potential risks this entails for nuclear safety. I call on the forces in effective control of the site to urgently facilitate the safe rotation of personnel there,” he said today., The handling of nuclear material at the Chornobyl NPP has been put on hold for the time being, the regulator added. The site, located in an Exclusion Zone, includes decommissioned reactors as well as radioactive waste facilities. The regulatory authority said it could only communicate with the plant via e-mail., To help protect the country’s nuclear facilities, the Director General has expressed his readiness to travel to the Chornobyl NPP, or elsewhere, to secure the commitment to the safety and security of all Ukraine’s nuclear facilities from the parties of the conflict., The Director General also indicated that remote data transmission from safeguards monitoring systems installed at the Chornobyl NPP had been lost. The Agency is looking into the status of safeguards monitoring systems in other locations in Ukraine and will provide further information soon., Regarding the status of Ukraine’s operational nuclear power plants, the regulator said eight of the country’s 15 reactors were operating, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP controlled since last week by Russian forces, and that the plants’ personnel were working in shifts. Radiation levels at the sites were normal, it said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-15-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-8-march-2022-enru

This included:, Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the real figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, the towns of Volnovakha, Mariupol, Izium where there are allegations of hundreds of civilian casualties.

Finland responds to Ukraine’s need of humanitarian assistance,News and Press Release,Govt. Finland,Contributions,9 Mar 2022,"Ukraine is Finland’s long-term partner country. Due to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, Finland grants humanitarian assistance in response to the acute distress and strengthens Ukraine’s sustainability in the midst of the war through development cooperation., People in Finland are widely moved by the distress of Ukrainians who have fled the war. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs collected answers to the central questions relating to Finland’s additional assistance to Ukraine and the earlier development cooperation between Finland and Ukraine., How much additional assistance has Finland granted to Ukraine?, In February 2022, Finland granted Ukraine a total of EUR 14 million in additional funding for development cooperation and humanitarian assistance. Of the additional funding for humanitarian purposes, Finland will direct EUR 8.2 million via the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and EUR 3 million via the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). EUR 5.8 million will be channelled to development cooperation under the Partnership Fund for a Resilient Ukraine, which is coordinated by the United Kingdom, and to the Council of Europe’s Action Plan for Ukraine and the OSCE’s project activities., What will Finland’s humanitarian assistance be used for?, The humanitarian situation in Ukraine is difficult. The UN estimates that as many as 12 million people will be in need of humanitarian assistance in the next few months. A large part of the population suffers from a lack of water, food and medicines, and people are unable to treat their injuries caused by the war. Those who have fled their homes need protection and emergency accommodation., Finnish humanitarian assistance delivered via the ICRC is used to help Ukrainians in need of, for example water, food, medicines and medical supplies. The ICRC has a special role in strengthening respect for and implementation of international humanitarian law. It engages in dialogue with the parties to the conflict, reminds them of their responsibility to protect civilians and ensures that civilians are not prevented from accessing basic services. Those who have fled their homes are assisted by the UNHCR, which provides emergency accommodation, protective equipment, food and medicines. Organisations have extensive experience of conflict and crisis situations, which means that they have the capacity to ensure free passage of relief to destinations in the very challenging conditions in Ukraine., Finland’s support will reach Ukraine also through the core funding granted to UN actors. These organisations include, for example, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the World Food Programme (WFP), which is responsible for food supplies and logistics; the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), which focuses on assisting children and families; the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which offers reproductive health services; and the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), in which Finland is among the top ten donors., Finland provides funding for humanitarian purposes in Ukraine also through the EU. The EU is one of the world’s largest donors of humanitarian assistance., What will the additional development cooperation funding granted by Finland be used for?, The additional exclusive ODA administered by the Foreign Ministry will be channelled to the Partnership Fund for a Resilient Ukraine, which is coordinated by the United Kingdom, to the Council of Europe’s Action Plan for Ukraine, and to the OSCE’s project activities., In addition to Finland, the Partnership Fund for Resilient Ukraine is funded by the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Switzerland and Sweden. The approximately EUR 40 million administered by the fund is used to support Ukraine’s sustainability extensively. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the fund focuses on such emergency needs in Ukraine as are related to its administration, communities, and communication links. The support will strengthen the ability of the Ukrainian government to coordinate humanitarian and emergency assistance, civil society's capacity to provide necessary services, and the communications opportunities of CSOs, the media and individual journalists. The fund is currently examining which projects would be suitable for support in light of Ukraine’s needs., The Council of Europe Action Plan for Ukraine supports Ukraine in fulfilling its obligations as a Member State of the Council of Europe and assists the country in implementing the Action Plan in the areas of human rights, the rule of law and democracy. The Council of Europe is currently assessing the reallocation of support so that it would respond to Ukraine’s needs., Finland has supported the Ukraine Programme of the OSCE High Commissioner for Minorities and projects of such other OSCE organisations as the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). The OSCE and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs are currently exploring projects that they could support in response to Ukraine’s needs., Ukraine has been Finland's partner country also before the war. What kind of development cooperation has Finland conducted in Ukraine?, Finland's objective is to improve the resilience of Ukrainian society, which refers to its ability to respond to changing situations. Finland gives also long-term support to Ukraine's structural reforms. The goals of Finland's Country Strategy for Ukraine are to restore the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and to guarantee respect for international law; to strengthen bilateral relations between Finland and Ukraine and to widen the scope of cooperation; to enhance the resilience of society and to improve the living conditions of citizens; as well as to strengthen the relations between the European Union and Ukraine., Finland's support to Ukraine in 2014--2021 was EUR 70 million. The additional support will increase the total support to approximately EUR 85 million. Finland has supported Ukraine, among other things, through development cooperation, humanitarian assistance and participation in mine clearance and civilian crisis management. Support has been channelled to various projects, international organisations' activities and secondment of experts., The share of development cooperation from Finland's overall support to Ukraine since 2014 has been approximately EUR 27 million. Finland's development cooperation helps Ukraine in reforming the basic and vocational education and training, supports the rule of law, and improves the country's energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources. Finland has supported the Council of Europe's Action Plan for Ukraine; projects carried out by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe OSCE; the Trust Fund for Energy Efficiency of the Nordic Environment Finance Corporation (NEFCO); the Eastern Europe Energy Efficiency and Environment Partnership of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD); the Finnish Meteorological Institute's meteorology project; and civil society organisations. Plans have been made to start cooperation in the forest sector., In previous years, Finland's humanitarian assistance has been channelled to the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Eastern Ukraine., What happens to Finland's development cooperation during the war?, Due to the war, progress in longer-term development cooperation projects is currently uncertain, and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs is monitoring developments closely. Finland is assessing the consequences of the war on the projects in cooperation with the contractors implementing the projects as well as the preconditions and needs for change., Finland grants additional support to Ukraine, Finland grants additional support to UkraineLink to an external website, Read all the news: Russian attack on Ukraine",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/finland-responds-ukraine-s-need-humanitarian-assistance
Refugee sector comes together in support of people of Ukraine,News and Press Release,Refugee Council,Protection and Human Rights,9 Mar 2022,"More than 40 charities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and aid agencies working with refugees have today backed a joint letter, published in the Guardian, to do more for the men, women and children of Ukraine who are right this minute being forced to leave their homes as tensions and violence in their country escalate rapidly., See the full letter below and in the Guardian here, Two million people have now fled the bloodshed in Ukraine and with many expected to do so, this could be the worst refugee crisis since the second world war. Seven decades ago in 1951, after the horrors of the world wars, the UK and other nations came together to sign the UN Convention on Refugees. It sets out that how a person arrives seeking protection does not matter. What matters is why -- escaping war, conflict and oppression., Yet today we have a government that appears to show a callous disregard for the Convention. It isn't giving all Ukrainians fleeing violence the opportunity to come to our country as a refugee (Priti Patel under fire over chaotic Ukrainian refugee policy, March 7). Instead, by setting up a limited and restricted family scheme and making a vague promise to establish some kind of humanitarian sponsorship programme, its response looks chaotic, heartless and unkind., At the same time, it is pushing ahead with its cruel Nationality and Borders Bill that will undermine the right to refugee protection and criminalise Ukrainians, Afghans and others who, through no fault of their own, are forced to make their own way to safety and arrive without all the necessary documentation., It seems the government has chosen to send a clear message to refugees from Ukraine and elsewhere that they are not welcome., Now, more than ever, is the time to strengthen, not weaken, our commitment to the UN Convention on Refugees, and ensure we provide protection to those who have lost everything., Signed",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/refugee-sector-comes-together-support-people-ukraine

Protection and Human Rights",8 Mar 2022,"Norway is allocating NOK 250 million to UN efforts to provide assistance to Ukrainian refugees who have fled to Ukraine’s neighbouring countries. Minister of Foreign Affairs Anniken Huitfeldt announced the allocation during her meeting with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, who visited Norway on Tuesday., ‘We may be facing the worst humanitarian disaster in Europe since the Second World War. Norway will support and show solidarity with people forced to flee from the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. We will also provide assistance to Ukraine’s neighbouring countries,’ said Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt., The UN estimates that 2 million people have crossed Ukraine’s borders to neighbouring countries to flee from the fighting. And countless people in the country are internally displaced., Mr Grandi came to Norway directly from his trip to Romania, Moldova and Poland, and was able to provide first-hand insight into the immediate situation on the ground. These and the other countries that share a border with Ukraine are trying to find ways to cope effectively with the extremely high influx of refugees., ‘It is both inspiring and moving to hear about the generosity Ukraine’s neighbouring countries are showing. The crisis is still in an early phase, and it is essential that we do what we can to enable these countries to continue to help those in need of immediate protection,’ said Ms Huitfeldt., The funding to the UN emergency appeal comes in addition to Norway’s allocation of NOK 50 million to the UN Refugee Agency’s efforts to assist displaced people in Ukraine and the neighbouring countries., ‘The work of the UN Refugee Agency is absolutely critical here. It is helping to ensure that Ukraine’s neighbouring countries are equipped to deal with refugees fleeing from the ongoing fighting,’ Ms Huitfeldt said., The UN Refugee Agency coordinates the refugee response with the authorities of the host country, the UN system and other humanitarian organisations. The UN is anticipating that as many as 4 million people could flee from the war in Ukraine. The High Commissioner has issued an appeal for USD 550 million from the international community to provide assistance to 2.4 million refugees and asylum-seekers in Ukraine’s neighbouring countries. The support will be used to provide cash assistance, shelter and protection, including reception capacity and proactive prevention and response to sexual and gender-based violence., The Government has allocated NOK 2 billion for humanitarian efforts in Ukraine and the response to the refugee crisis. This assistance will mainly be channelled through the UN, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and other humanitarian actors. Norway is also providing support through the joint European preparedness and response mechanisms. Norway is among the largest donors to the UN Refugee Agency, and has provided NOK 630 million in core support for this year.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/norway-increases-funding-un-efforts-assist-ukrainian-refugees
Statement from Warsaw by Refugees International President on the Crisis in Ukraine,News and Press Release,RI,Protection and Human Rights,8 Mar 2022,"Warsaw — I am completing a six-day trip (March 3-9) to Poland with a Refugees International (RI) team, in which we have travelled about 600 miles through eastern Poland and visited cities, towns, and villages receiving Ukrainian refugees. Our team also includes RI Europe Advocate Daphne Panayotatos and Special Assistant to the President Irla Atanda. After beginning the trip in Warsaw, we travelled to Przemyśl and the Medyka border crossing, to the Hrebenne border crossing, and to the city of Lublin and the border crossing at Dorohusk., During this trip, our RI team has met with Ukrainians who have just arrived in Poland, with local officials, and with NGO workers and volunteers from Poland and other parts of Europe. We've also met with UN and U.S. officials, including U.S. Ambassador to Poland Mark Brzezinski., Echoing the sentiments of so many Ukrainians, a woman from Zhytomyr (near Kyiv), whom we met at Dorohusk, declared she would not have left her home but for the safety of her children. And her calculation is reasonable: several Ukrainian women (who, along with their children, make up the majority of Ukrainian refugees) shared heart-breaking personal accounts of abuses by Russian troops. These have offered presumptive evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity---consistent with a rapidly accumulating body of information from a wide variety of sources., In many respects, the response in Poland to this crisis has been encouraging and heartening, with NGOs, individual volunteers, and local officials helping Ukrainians upon arrival and in moving from the border to temporary (and in some cases semi-permanent) accommodation in Poland and elsewhere in Europe. As U.S. Ambassador Brzezinski said to our team, the challenge will be sustaining this impressive effort over time., While addressing the refugee crisis is a critical imperative, I believe that a far greater challenge will be meeting humanitarian needs within Ukraine. In fact, there are estimates that as many as 7 million Ukrainians may become newly displaced within Ukrainian territory. In addition, civilians who wish to depart Ukraine must be guaranteed safe passage., At this point, there are several actions that the United States, and other governments, must take to ensure a response that promotes the rights and well-being of Ukrainians at risk:, President Biden should immediately announce that he will authorize, on an emergency basis, the resettlement of 100,000 or more Ukrainian refugees over the next two years., The UN Secretary General and interested governments---including the government of China---must press Russian President Putin to guarantee Ukrainian civilians' safe passage to countries that will offer genuine protection for those seeking to flee Ukraine., USAID and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) must accelerate efforts to develop an assistance support infrastructure in Ukraine and prioritize aid through local organizations in Ukraine. Donor governments must commit to sustain generous levels of support that will be necessary., The United States and other donor countries should direct significant financial support to the governments of refugee-receiving countries bordering Ukraine, and work with national governments to ensure that aid is provided to NGOs and officials working at local levels in each of these countries., EU Member States must swiftly implement the EU Temporary Protection Directive in an inclusive way to provide safety and support for all those who need protection. European countries can sustain an effective response that benefits Ukrainians and their host communities., The UN Secretary General, the Secretary of State, and European governments should press Poland and other nations bordering Ukraine to ensure that non-Ukrainian nationals are treated fairly and without discrimination---to include access to safe territories and adequate reception---a concern that our team raised with many of our interlocutors., The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) should intensify the investigation relating to war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression, which has been supported by a number of governments. The United States should strongly support this effort., For more information or to arrange an interview, please contact Refugees International's VP for Strategic Outreach Sarah Sheffer at ssheffer@refugeesinternational.org.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-warsaw-refugees-international-president-crisis-ukraine

Recovery and Reconstruction",9 Mar 2022,"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has announced an initial €2 billion resilience package of measures to help citizens, companies and countries affected by the war on Ukraine. The Bank has also pledged to do all it can to help with the country’s reconstruction, once conditions allow., Funding will be made rapidly available to support Ukrainian companies– for example, with deferred loans, liquidity support, and trade finance. Where possible, businesses will be helped to relocate so their work can continue., In addition, the Bank’s Resilience and Livelihoods Framework will help in countries directly affected by inflows of Ukrainian refugees. Women, children and the elderly make up the majority of displaced citizens, and municipal authorities face huge challenges in managing the influx of people., This package was endorsed today by the Bank’s Board of Directors and represents a first round of support. The EBRD had previously declared its unwavering support to Ukraine and its people, and condemned the aggression by the Russian Federation and Belarus., EBRD President Odile Renaud-Basso said: “The Bank will step up with renewed resolve and calm professionalism, delivering on its mandate and mission. The times ahead are highly uncertain, and the EBRD must remain flexible, streamlined and nimble, retaining our focus on delivery., “Our shareholders have given their full support to this package, and our staff are already working on the ground to implement these steps. We are facing an unparalleled crisis, but throughout our history, we have been a Bank that rises to the challenge. The people of Ukraine have our complete backing.”, Once conditions permit, the EBRD will also be prepared to take part in a reconstruction programme for Ukraine, to rebuild livelihoods and businesses; restore vital infrastructure; support good governance; and enable access to services., It envisages working with international partners including the EU and US, as well as bilateral donors and other international financial institutions. It expects there to be a surge in investment in energy security, as well as an acceleration of decarbonisation efforts., Within Ukraine, the Resilience and Livelihoods Framework will focus on four main elements:, In the neighbouring countries taking in refugees, the Framework will concentrate on:, The Framework could also be extended more widely to cover other countries with particular concerns over energy security. The Bank expects the crisis to have serious consequences for many of the economies where it works., The package announced today will complement EBRD operations already underway, and will work to the Bank’s standards of being additional to other available financial services, and working to sound banking principles., Ukraine is one of the Bank’s biggest countries of operations, with cumulative lending of more than €16 billion in 511 projects since the EBRD started work, including more than €1 billion in 2021.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ebrd-unveils-2-billion-resilience-package-response-war-ukraine-enru

(Source: FTS), HIGHLIGHTS, • On 7 March, Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC), briefed the United Nations Security Council on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. He called on all parties to the conflict to allow the safe passage of civilians out of hardest-hit areas and safe delivery of humanitarian supplies into those areas. The ERC informed the Council that his office sent a team to Moscow to work on humanitarian civil-military coordination., • Clashes continue around Kyiv oblast as Russian forces move closer to the Ukrainian capital. On 7 March, at least 13 people were reportedly killed after an air strike hit a bread factory in Makariv – around 50 km west of Kyiv – according to local emergency services. Governmental officials say more than 4,000 people urgently need to be evacuated from hotspots outside Kyiv., • After a third round of talks between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, both sides agreed on “safe passage” for the evacuation of civilians and uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian aid in the north-eastern city of Sumy – home to around 264,700 inhabitants. At the time of writing, it remains unclear if evacuations or safe passage of humanitarian aid has gotten underway in Sumy., • In less than two weeks, more than 2 million people have been forced to flee to neighbouring countries, generating evergrowing protection risks, including gender-based violence (GBV) and sexual exploitation and abuse, as the majority of people on the move are women and children. The rapid and massive influx of displaced people in western Ukraine and neighbouring countries is overwhelming response capacities., • In response to the immense health needs generated by the ongoing crisis, the Ministry of Health says more than 400,000 tons of medical supplies have been delivered to Ukraine by neighbouring governments and humanitarian partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)., • The World Food Programme (WFP) projects an exponential rise in food insecurity across all oblasts of Ukraine. Considering that the Russian Federation and Ukraine are responsible for almost one-third of the global wheat trade, the unfolding crisis could have dire implications for global food security., SITUATION OVERVIEW, The destruction of civilian objects continues to be reported. According to the Government of Ukraine, relentless shelling across the country has damaged or destroyed more than 210 schools, at least 34 hospitals and more than 1,500 residential buildings, figures that continue to climb with each passing day., In less than two weeks, more than 2 million people have had to flee to neighbouring countries, generating ever-growing protection risks, including GBV and sexual exploitation and abuse, as the majority of people on the move are women and children. The rapid and massive influx of displaced people in western Ukraine and refugees to neighbouring countries is risks overwhelming national response capacities. Lviv, a city of around 721,300 people in western Ukraine, is estimated by the Government of Ukraine to be currently hosting approximately 200,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) – more than a quarter of its population. The city’s Mayor warned that Lviv is facing a breaking point in its capacity to absorb any more displaced people., After 13 days of intense fighting, civilian casualties continue to mount across the country. Between 4 a.m. on 24 February and midnight on 7 March, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports at least 1,335 civilian casualties, including 474 killed, although the actual number of civilian casualties is likely much higher. OHCHR reports 545 casualties in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (72 killed and 337 injured in Government-controlled areas, GCA, and 24 killed and 112 injured in non-Government-controlled areas, NGCA) and 790 civilian casualties in other regions of Ukraine., On 7 March, Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC), called on all parties to allow the safe passage of civilians out of affected areas and safe passage of humanitarian supplies into those areas. During his address to the Council, the ERC stated that his office sent a team to Moscow to work on enhanced humanitarian civil-military coordination., After the third round of talks between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, both sides agreed on “safe passage” for the evacuation of civilians and uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian aid in the north-eastern city of Sumy – home to around 264,700 inhabitants. The Ukrainian side also requested “safe passage” for civilians and humanitarian goods in and out of the cities of Mariupol, Volnovakha (Donetska oblast, GCA) towards Zaporizhzhia (Zaporizka oblast, south-east); from Kyiv and Kyivska oblast towards western Ukraine, and Kharkiv and Kharkivska oblast (east) towards the west of the country., These routes are reportedly yet to be agreed upon with the Russian Federation. In addition, the Russian Federation informed that at least 174,000 persons have been evacuated from affected areas of Ukraine., In Mariupol, the long-awaited evacuation of civilians was once again postponed as hostilities raged on. The military encirclement of the city – now on its 10th consecutive day – has left hundreds of thousands of people without water and electricity, while the most basic supplies, like food and medicines, are quickly running out. The humanitarian situation on the ground remains dire., Attacks are happening at a greater rate and scale, in major cities across Ukraine, including Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv and Mykolaiv, and in the multiple locations in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without water, electricity, gas and telecommunications. In certain parts of the country, especially in cities that remain under ceaseless military encirclement, like Mariupol and Volnovakha (Donetska oblast, GCA), access to food and critical health services has become extremely limited., Kyivska oblast continues to be a hotbed of violent clashes as forces of the Russian Federation move closer to the Ukrainian capital. The towns of Bucha, Hostomel, Irpin, Makariv and Vorzel on the outskirts of Kyiv have recently witnessed increasingly intense fighting, with devastating humanitarian consequences. On 7 March, at least 13 people were reportedly killed after an air strike hit a bread factory in Makariv, according to local emergency services., While 2,000 people have been evacuated from Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin, Governmental officials say more than 4,000 people urgently need to be evacuated in hotspots outside Kyiv. As the railway track and bridge leading out of Irpin – around 25 km north-west of Kyiv – have been destroyed, people are reportedly evacuating the town on foot, putting their lives at risk by fleeing amid ongoing shelling., As fighting rages on across certain parts of Ukraine, medical care for hundreds of thousands of people can no longer be guaranteed. Insecurity Insight reported at least two dozen incidents where explosive weapons damaged health facilities in the first week of the hostilities alone. Trauma and injuries in the hardest-hit areas are exacerbated by a lack of access to health facilities and health professionals who themselves are increasingly affected by growing displacement and insecurity, and a limited access to life-saving medicine and supplies. In response to the immense health needs generated by the ongoing crisis, the Ministry of Health says more than 400,000 tons of medical supplies have been delivered by neighbouring governments and humanitarian partners, including WHO and UNICEF., Many communities across Ukraine remain cut off from food and other basic supplies. Even before the current escalation. 1.1 million people were in need of food and livelihood assistance in eastern Ukraine alone. As hostilities affect new localities with each passing day, potentially displacing people multiple times and severely disrupting livelihoods, WFP projects an exponential rise in food insecurity across all oblasts of Ukraine. Considering that the Russian Federation and Ukraine are responsible for almost one-third of the global wheat trade, the unfolding crisis could have dire implications for global food security.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-8-march-2022

Shelter and Non-Food Items",8 Mar 2022,"By Jason Dueck, Try to imagine hearing air raid sirens scream out their warning. In your panic, you seek shelter. Your freezing fingers remind you of the warm coat you've forgotten back home. Or maybe you pack the car full of blankets and food, planning to flee to a safer location. You hope you won't get stuck in a kilometres-long line at a checkpoint. But as your child runs a fever, you realize you didn’t pack any medicine., These are the kinds of stories Linda Herr, MCC area director for Europe and the Middle East, is hearing from MCC partners and staff in Ukraine every time she picks up her phone. But amidst the incredible hardships Ukrainians are facing, she also hears stories of communities coming together in extraordinary ways., Herr says that MCC partners in Ukraine are already meeting essential and immediate needs on the ground where they are., ""We are seeing a very local response,"" says Herr. ""Many of our partners are taking funds that would have been used for local projects that can't happen now and they're buying food, medicine, blankets, mattresses—anything and everything that people need."", They are bringing mattresses to people who are sleeping in basements or stairwells, which are serving as makeshift bomb shelters. They are setting up rooms in schools that provide shelter for people on the move. Partners are also providing fuel for vehicles and food for families on their way to other, more secure parts of the country., ""They’re saying 'I know you're my neighbour, I know you're in need. Maybe you’re just passing through from some other part of the country, but you need something, and I can help you,'"" says Herr., With Ukraine's ports now blocked off by Russian military forces, and no air access, supplies are hard to come by. MCC partners are focusing on what they can do in the moment, purchasing what they can find and transporting supplies in whatever size vehicles they have available., Local church partners are also doing their best to provide essentials for people who were struggling even before the conflict broke out. ""Churches are sharing contact information of people who are elderly, disabled or sick — those who normally are unable to leave their homes. People who don’t have a lot of resources and can’t just call for help anymore,"" says Herr., That sharing of information means vulnerable people can receive resources they wouldn’t be able to get themselves while their city is in conflict. Churches have been hubs for supply distribution, and they also serve as places of comfort during times of trauma and stress., ""Churches are gathering to pray and to encourage each other when they can,"" says Herr. ""And when meeting in person is too dangerous, they send photos to each other as a source of encouragement."", While MCC partners are finding creative ways to provide emergency relief, they are also working with MCC to plan medium- and long-term responses to the devastation. Future projects will likely address needs in the areas of food, shelter and trauma care, especially for those who are being displaced by violence., ""It's humbling to be between the people who want to give and the people who are seeing the need, who are trying to get resources into people's hands,"" she says. ""But the partners, the people in Ukraine, they're telling me they're tired. So many people have left, and for those who remain, there is so much work yet to do., ""Please pray for the people here. Every minute this conflict continues, the humanitarian impacts worsen. Pray for peace. And pray that our partners will continue to have the strength to carry on their good work.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/mcc-church-partners-ukraine-supply-essential-local-care

"International Women's Day: Ukraine situation shows urgent need for gender-sensitive humanitarian aid, says CARE",News and Press Release,CARE,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",8 Mar 2022,"“It was a big panic, lots of people shouting, children crying, no security.” This is how Natalia Lutoya describes the chaotic situation when she reached the train station in Lysychansk with her son fleeing Ukraine. Just like her, millions of people are currently trying to escape the war in Ukraine. As men aged 18-60 have to stay in the country due to the general mobilization, it is mainly women, children and the elderly who are travelling on their own., On the occasion of International Women's Day, the humanitarian aid organization CARE warns that women in crises are particularly often affected by violence, exploitation and also gender-based violence. They need tailored support and protection., “Humanitarian aid in Ukraine and neighboring countries must be based on experiences of both past and ongoing crises,” notes Delphine Pinault, CARE International Humanitarian Policy Coordinator and UN Representative. “This includes ensuring gender analysis and sex, age and disability disaggregated data is part of needs assessments and used to inform our response. It means providing safe spaces for women and girls in displacement settings, in transit centers, at border points, ensuring relief supplies include menstrual hygiene management items, for example, and having enough women and gender experts in humanitarian teams. These actions contribute to programs that better respond to women and girls' specific concerns and needs and makes them feel safer, both physically and mentally”., The vulnerability of women and girls is also evident in other contexts of war and conflict, which continue unabated in many parts of the world. In Yemen, only half of all existing health facilities are currently fully functional. Only one in five facilities provides maternal and child health services. As a result, a woman dies during childbirth every two hours. More than two-thirds of girls in Yemen are now married underage. In Syria, practices such as child marriage have also increased dramatically as a result of the conflict. Hundreds of thousands of women are left to care for their families alone, struggling to make ends meet in exile and generate income to provide for their children., “It's not enough to talk about women and their needs just on International Women's Day. CARE and our partners work 365 days a year to ensure that women and girls have access to gender-responsive humanitarian assistance – in Ukraine, neighboring countries, and all over the world” says Delphine Pinault., About CARE: Founded in 1945, CARE is a leading humanitarian organization fighting global poverty. CARE has more than seven decades of experience helping people prepare for disasters, providing lifesaving assistance when a crisis hits, and helping communities recover after the emergency has passed. CARE places special focus on women and children, who are often disproportionately affected by disasters. To learn more, visit www.care-international.org., As part of the Ukraine response, CARE International is currently partnering with People in Need, one of the largest non-governmental organisations in Eastern Europe and has provided humanitarian aid in the affected regions of Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict in 2014. CARE is also working with its long-term partner of 20 years SERA - a child protection focused organization - in Romania to deliver assistance to those fleeing into Romania from Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/international-womens-day-ukraine-situation-shows-urgent-need-gender-sensitive

Ukraine: EU steps up solidarity with those fleeing war,News and Press Release,ECHO,"Health
Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",8 Mar 2022,"The Commission outlines today the very substantial support the EU is making available to help people fleeing war in Ukraine and the EU countries receiving them., In the face of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified military invasion of Ukraine, European solidarity in action is helping people through (i) direct humanitarian aid, (ii) emergency civil protection assistance, (iii) support at the border, and (iv) clear legal status allowing those fleeing the war to receive immediate protection in the EU., The assistance available includes:, Humanitarian support: As President von der Leyen has announced, €500 million from the EU budget is being directed to deal with the tragic humanitarian consequences of the war, both inside Ukraine and beyond. Of this, €90 million in humanitarian aid including €85 million for Ukraine and €5 million for Moldova, is already underway to provide food, water, health care, shelter, and help cover the basic needs of the most vulnerable. Through the largest ever activation of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism in response to an emergency, millions of items including vehicles, medical kits, tents, blankets, and sleeping bags have already reached those in need in Ukraine, while further assistance is delivered to neighbouring Moldova, Poland and Slovakia to support all those fleeing the war., Support for border management: The Commission has issued operational guidelines to help Member States' border guards manage arrivals at the borders with Ukraine efficiently and reduce waiting time while maintaining a high level of security. EU agencies are also providing extra staff and expertise to support Member States, with for instance 49 Frontex staff deployed at EU-Ukraine and Moldova-Ukraine borders and an extra 162 staff being deployed to Romania. Moldova will also receive an additional €15 million to help manage the situation., Protection for those fleeing and support for reception capacity: In record time the EU unanimously agreed to activate the Temporary Protection Directive to bring clarity and security to people in need, offering rights to welfare support, access to the job market and education. Central to this approach is the solidarity between Member States. A ‘Solidarity Platform', where Member States can exchange information about reception capacity will be coordinated by the Commission. The Home Affairs funds for 2021-27 will also bring significant extra resources for Member States to ensure adequate reception facilities and effective asylum procedures. The Commission is also proposing to prolong the implementation period for the money available to Member States under the 2014-2020 Home Affairs funds, which would release around €420 million in additional support., Cohesion policy action for refugees in Europe: The Commission is also adopting the “Cohesion’s Action for Refugees in Europe” (CARE) legislative proposal. This will bring additional flexibility to finance a wide range of measures supporting people fleeing Ukraine, from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Fund for the European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD). For example, these cohesion funds can be spent on investments in education, employment, housing, health and childcare services, and in the case of FEAD, on basic material assistance like food and clothing. To further support Member States, the exceptional 100% co-financing rate applied in response to the pandemic will be extended by a year. Moreover, around €10 billion from the 2022 Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (‘REACT-EU’) funds is readily available and can also be used to finance actions to support those fleeing Ukraine., Members of the College said:, Vice-President for Promoting out European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: “Visiting the borders, we witnessed incredibly moving scenes, with national officials, civil society and ordinary citizens coming to the aid of those arriving from Ukraine. The European Union is supporting these efforts with the full force and breadth of our instruments, personnel and funding. The activation of the temporary protection directive is an unequivocal and very tangible expression of support with those fleeing the war in Ukraine. And today we are mobilising additional funding to support Member States in this effort.”, Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, said: “A welcome reprieve in these difficult times is the solidarity shown by Europeans and European Member States to people fleeing the war in Ukraine. I saw this spirit first hand in Siret, Romania and Medyka, Poland, but it is there across the EU. When we act together we act effectively - protecting people fleeing the war in Ukraine. This is Europe at its best: Providing the temporary protection needed and the funds to back it up.”, Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, said: “The biggest casualty of this brutal military aggression are innocent people living in Ukraine. The EU together with its Member States is working around the clock to bring emergency assistance in Ukraine and to countries directly affected by the influx of migrants. At the same time, we are providing lifesaving aid to our humanitarian partners on the ground to reach people in need. It is imperative that this aggression stops now as the humanitarian situation is getting critical with each passing day.”, Commissioner for Enlargement and Neighbourhood, Olivér Várhelyi, said: “With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, war has unfortunately returned to Europe and in these darkest hours we need to help Ukraine but also its neighbours who are affected. Our first emergency assistance is already being delivered. And we are, as part of €500 million, urgently preparing a package of €330 million to provide assistance to people both in Ukraine and those forced to flee, especially the children and the elderly. And we work on longer-term objectives, from energy security to economic recovery and resilience.”, Background, On 24 February, the Russian armed forces launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. As a result of this unprovoked and unjustified aggression, substantial areas of the Ukrainian territory now constitute areas of war from which many persons are fleeing., Through stepping up humanitarian assistance in Ukraine, as well as financial and operational support to Member States and Moldova, the EU and its Member States are providing protection for people fleeing war in Ukraine. The EU has also reacted swiftly and decisively to Russia’s aggression by adopting severe sanctions that will have massive consequences for Russia., The EU will continue to stand united in its solidarity with Ukraine and its people. The Commission will continue providing support, including by ensuring the adequate level of preparation and a long-term focus on delivery in all Member States and Moldova to be ready to meet the needs as they evolve.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-eu-steps-solidarity-those-fleeing-war

Thousands of civilian casualties have already been reported and vital civilian infrastructure is heavily damaged., The EU, together with its partners, supports Ukraine with emergency assistance, both humanitarian aid and civil protection., How is the EU helping now, given the current humanitarian situation?, The EU is providing both humanitarian aid and civil protection assistance to Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova, Poland and Slovakia as people fleeing the war continue to arrive., Following Russia’s invasion, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 1,123 civilian casualties in Ukraine, of which 364 killed. Real figures are probably considerably higher., On 1 March, Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen announced at least €500 million EU funding for response activities dealing with the humanitarian consequences of the crisis., This includes €90 million in initial support for our humanitarian partners on the ground, to alleviate the suffering of people in need in Ukraine and those who fled to neighbouring countries, particularly to Moldova., This new funding will help people inside Ukraine and those who have fled to neighbouring countries through the provision of food, water, healthcare, shelter, protection and help to cover their basic needs., “Ensuring humanitarian access, including through the establishment of humanitarian corridors, is an urgent priority right now as to enable the delivery of humanitarian aid to people in need caught in the ongoing war in Ukraine. It is imperative that civilians are protected, and humanitarian workers can do their jobs in safety and without impediments, as obliged by international humanitarian law,” said Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič., The needs are growing by the day. This is why our Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) is working 24/7 to monitor the situation in the country and respond to requests for assistance from Ukraine and neighbouring countries., What material assistance is being deployed?, EU countries have offered medical supplies and equipment, ambulances, beds, tents, generators, and other much needed emergency relief items via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to Ukraine and neighbouring countries hosting Ukrainian refugees., “The Ukrainian authorities tell us what they need most urgently in terms of emergency assistance. These needs are communicated to the participating states of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism,” explains Jürgen Schreiber, who is leading the Civil Protection Team in Poland., “When we get offers for assistance, we make sure they get here as quickly as possible, and in a coordinated manner. We work closely with the Polish authorities. Then, they are loaded on trucks and trains headed for Ukraine and dispatched to the places where they are most needed,” says Schreiber. “Personally, I am impressed by the outpour of solidarity that we have been seeing here in Poland and countries all over the world.”, Moldova activated the EU Civil Protection Mechanism on 24 February, asking for assistance to accommodate refugees fleeing Ukraine, while Slovakia did the same on 27 February., Poland has also activated the EU Civil Protection Mechanism on 28 February, requesting medical items and medicines. So far, 26 EU countries (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands) have already offered support. In addition, Norway has also contributed as a participating state to the EU Civil Protection Mechanism., How do you make sure the assistance reaches Ukraine and its neighbouring countries?, The European Commission has established logistical civil protection hubs in Poland, Romania and Slovakia. These hubs are channelling the assistance delivered from European countries via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism in response to the requests for assistance by Ukraine and neighbouring countries., In addition, the EU is also deploying further assistance via the rescEU medical stockpiles based in Germany, Hungary and the Netherlands. This support includes ventilators, infusion pumps, patient monitors, masks and gowns, ultrasound devices and oxygen concentrators., The EU stands ready to set up further emergency assistance to Ukraine and those forced to flee their homes in cooperation with neighbouring countries., When did the EU start to provide emergency aid to Ukraine?, On 15 February and following a request for assistance by the Government of Ukraine, the Commission started coordinating the delivery of essential supplies via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. Aid was swiftly deployed to support Ukraine’s preparedness for all possible scenarios, with the threat of further escalation., Since 2014, the EU and its Member States have supported Ukraine with over €1 billion in humanitarian aid and early recovery aid. We have funded projects covering cash assistance, health, protection activities, shelter, water, psychosocial support, and education in emergencies, among other intervention areas., In the past years, the humanitarian assistance has been provided in eastern Ukraine - both along the line of contact and in the areas not controlled by the Ukrainian government. Assistance has also been provided to Ukrainian civilians having fled to Russia.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/eu-solidarity-ukraine-how-eu-providing-emergency-assistance

Water Sanitation Hygiene",8 Mar 2022,"Teams of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Ukrainian Red Cross are responding to the needs of civilians who are bearing the brunt of the conflict. On March 2nd, the ICRC donated food, hygiene items and items for children to more than 4,000 people displaced from their homes and living in shelters in the city of Mariupol, a city in south-eastern Ukraine. As the death toll and injuries rise, the ICRC is looking to ramp up its humanitarian response., “It’s me and my family: my daughter-in-law, my son, my daughter and my grandmother. We are now in the dormitory. We fled from the Artana area under bomb explosions. Shells fell directly on our heads, so we ran away in what we were wearing to the basement. We need everything now. We are wearing what kind people and the Red Cross gave us. Right now, we are in dire need of medicine and hygiene products,” said Nataylia, who is staying in a shelter for 100 people in the center of Mariupol., The situation is incredibly tense, dangerous and distressing for people. We see that many people have no water, electricity, and minimal phone connectivity. People’s first concern is for their families, people are desperately trying to get in touch with their relatives, but internet connectivity is very bad. People are seeking safety in shelters, often for hours on end., Our teams are seeing lots of street to street fighting, including near where ICRC personnel are working and living. Most, if not all stores are closed, meaning ordinary citizens have big difficulty buying items. The humanitarian needs are growing by the minute and ICRC teams are doing everything they can to mitigate the impact of the conflict on the civilian population., “We have been here since the first day they started bombing. I have seven children, I am alone. We came here with nothing. We get help here. We need food, clothes, batteries and everything you need for everyday life. We will be grateful for any help you can offer us,” said Yulia, a mother of seven from a shelter in Mariupol., Our teams on the ground already see the latest intensification triggering new displacement. We can see the emergency needs will be significant and comprehensive, including medical needs, water, food, shelter and necessities for people. Today’s distribution of aid to civilians in Mariupol represents only a drop in the ocean of what is needed., Note to editors:, The ICRC has been working for the people affected by the conflict in Ukraine since 2014. Our operations in the country are among the ten largest ICRC operations worldwide with a team of over 600 staff members. Working closely with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society, we are increasing our response to the humanitarian needs in Ukraine. Our support to people includes emergency assistance such as food, water, and other essential items. We also support hospitals and primary healthcare facilities with medical equipment and emergency preparedness. We repair water stations and support households to rehabilitate their damaged homes. We also help families separated by the conflict reconnect. Established in 1863, the ICRC operates worldwide helping people affected by conflict and armed violence and promoting the laws that protect victims of war. A neutral, independent and impartial organization, its mandate stems from the Geneva Conventions of 1949. It is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and works in more than 100 countries.

Ukraine: Protecting life must be a priority - UN human rights experts,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,8 Mar 2022,"GENEVA (8 March 2022) -- UN human rights experts* today called on the Russian Federation to immediately end its invasion of Ukraine to avoid further bloodshed and loss of life., The experts said intentional attacks against civilians and civilian objects could amount to war crimes, and those responsible should be held to account and prosecuted., ""We condemn all attacks allegedly targeting civilians and call for them to stop immediately,"" said the independent experts appointed by the Human Rights Council, which on Friday adopted a resolution encouraging Special Procedures mandate holders ""to pay particular attention to the situation of human rights in Ukraine*"".*, ""Protecting lives and ensuring life-saving assistance to the civilian population in need, regardless of race, ethnicity or nationality, must be the paramount priorities for all,"" the experts said. ""We welcome the agreement for establishing humanitarian corridors or temporary demilitarized zones intended to allow the safe transit of protected persons out and humanitarian aid into designated areas, which should be agreed by the parties, and call for them to be fully respected, but this will not suffice to prevent further bloodshed and loss of life."", Russian military operations in Ukraine have, thus far, resulted in the death or injury of hundreds of civilians of all ages, including women and children, and the displacement of a million refugees who have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries in addition to at least one million people who have been internally displaced since the Russian invasion. In this context, persons are more exposed to going missing and families can be separated. Customary international law provides that each party to the conflict must take all feasible measures to account for persons reported missing as a result of armed conflict and must provide their family members with any information it has on their fate. Many more risk dying as a result of the destruction of essential infrastructure, including health care facilities and institutions for older persons with disabilities., ""The attacks against nuclear sites and plants risk further endangering the lives of millions, in Ukraine and the wider region,"" the experts said., ""We are extremely concerned by the reported use by the Russian military forces of weapons, such as cluster bombs and ammunitions, having excessive and injurious effects on the population. Cluster bombs are extremely dangerous and difficult to clear and therefore also constitute a long-term obstacle in post-conflict recovery and reconstruction processes., ""We also condemn the alleged targeting and indiscriminate bombing by the Russian military forces of residential buildings and civilian objects and infrastructures, including schools, kindergartens, care institutions and hospitals, and call for the protection of all cultural heritage sites, such as the Babi Yar Holocaust Memorial site in Kiev, which has reportedly been damaged."", The experts recalled that intentional attacks against civilians and civilian objects amount to war crimes. All alleged violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law must be thoroughly, independently, impartially and effectively investigated with a view to establishing full accountability of all those responsible., ""We therefore welcome and fully support the latest initiative by the Human Rights Council for the setting up of an investigative and accountability mechanism, as well as the decision by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to open an investigation into the situation in Ukraine,"" the experts said., ENDS, The experts: Morris Tidball-Binz*, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; Michael Lynk ,* Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967; Clément Nyaletsossi Voule , Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association; Michael Fakhri, Special Rapporteur on the right to food; Nils Melzer*,* Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; Pedro Arrojo Agudo , Special Rapporteur on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation; Reem Alsalem , Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences; Melissa Upreti (Chair), Dorothy Estrada Tanck (Vice-Chair), Elizabeth Broderick , Ivana Radačić , and Meskerem Geset Techane, Working Group on discrimination against women and girls; Saad Alfarargi, Special Rapporteur on the right to development; Claudia Mahler, Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons; José Francisco Calí Tzay, Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples;Victor Madrigal-Borloz, Independent Expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity; Cecilia Jimenez-Damary, Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons; Irene Khan, Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression; Fabián Salvioli , Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence; Ms. Sorcha MacLeod (Chair-Rapporteur), Ms. Jelena Aparac, Mr. Ravindran Daniel, Mr. Chris Kwaja ,Working Group on the use of mercenaries; Dr. Mohamed Abdelsalam Babiker, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea; Gerard Quinn, Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities; Mary Lawlor , Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; The UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances: Mr. Luciano Hazan (Chair-Rapporteur), Ms. Aua Baldé (Vice Chair), Ms. Gabriella Citroni, Mr. Henrikas Mickevičius and Mr. Tae-Ung Baik; Livingstone Sewanyana, Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order; Ahmed Shaheed, Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief; Tlaleng Mofokeng,** Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; Yao Agbetse, Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in the Central African Republic; Vitit Muntarbhorn*,* Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Cambodia; Alice Cruz, Special Rapporteur on the elimination of discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members; the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent Ms. Dominique Day , current Chair-Rapporteur; Ms Catherine S.

This included:, a total of 474 killed (97 men, 54 women, 8 boys, and 4 girls, as well as 17 children and 294 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 861 injured (76 men, 55 women, 11 girls, and 3 boys, as well as 30 children and 686 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 545 casualties (96 killed and 449 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 409 casualties (72 killed and 337 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 136 casualties (24 killed and 112 injured), In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 790 casualties (378 killed and 412 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the real figures are considerably higher, especially in Governmentcontrolled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, the towns of Volnovakha,, Mariupol, Izium where there are allegations of hundreds of civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, according to which as of 12 pm (local time) 6 March, 38 children had been killed and 71 injured. OHCHR also notes a report by the National Police of Kharkiv region, according to which as of 9 am (local time) 7 March, the total number of civilian casualties in Kharkiv region was 133 killed (128 adults and 5 children) and 319 injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-7-march-2022-enruuk

Update 14 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (7 March 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,7 Mar 2022,"Ukraine told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that a new nuclear research facility producing radioisotopes for medical and industrial applications had been damaged by shelling in the city of Kharkiv, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said. The national nuclear regulator said the incident did not cause any increase in radiation levels at the site., The facility in north-eastern Ukraine is used for research and development and radioisotope production. Because the nuclear material in the facility is always subcritical and the inventory of radioactive material is very low, the IAEA’s assessment confirmed that the damage reported to it would not have had any radiological consequence, the Director General said., Nevertheless, Sunday’s incident highlighted once again the risks facing Ukraine’s nuclear installations during the armed conflict, adding urgency to an IAEA initiative aimed at ensuring nuclear safety and security in the country., “We have already had several episodes compromising safety at Ukraine’s nuclear sites,” Director General Grossi said., On 27 February, Ukraine said missiles hit the site of a radioactive waste disposal facility in the capital Kyiv but there was no radioactive release. That came a day after an electrical transformer at a similar disposal facility near Kharkiv was damaged. On 4 March, when the site was taken over by Russian forces, Ukraine said the training centre of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) was hit by a projectile, causing a fire that was later extinguished., In addition, the regulator said there continued to be no communication with enterprises and institutions using Category 1-3 radiation sources in the eastern port city of Mariupol, including its Oncological Centre. Therefore, their safety and security could not be confirmed. Such radioactive material can cause serious harm to people if not secured and managed properly., “We must take action to help avert a nuclear accident in Ukraine that could have severe consequences for public health and the environment. We can’t afford to wait,” Director General Grossi said., To help protect the country’s nuclear facilities, he has expressed his readiness to travel to the Chornobyl NPP to secure the commitment to the safety and security of all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants from the parties of the conflict., “I have said I am willing to travel to Chornobyl, but it can be anywhere, as long as it facilitates this necessary and urgent action,“ he told an IAEA Board of Governors meeting today., At Chornobyl, the site of the 1986 accident that is under the control of Russian forces since 24 February, the current shift of around 210 technical personal and guards has still not been able to rotate, the regulator said. The same staff have been on the site for 12 days now., Director General Grossi has repeatedly stressed the importance of operating staff being able to rest to carry out their important jobs safely and securely., In another worrying development, Ukraine’s regulator today also informed the IAEA that it was currently not possible to deliver spare parts or medicine to the Zaporizhzhya NPP, a day after the country said plant management was now under orders from the commander of the Russian forces controlling the site. Plant personnel were, however, able to rotate, it added., The Director General reiterated that having operating staff subject to the authority of the Russian military commander contravenes an indispensable pillar of nuclear safety., Regarding the status of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, the regulator said eight of the country’s 15 reactors were operating, including two at the Zaporizhzhya NPP.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-14-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-7-march-2022-enru
World Bank Mobilizes an Emergency Financing Package of over $700 million for Ukraine [EN/UK/RU],News and Press Release,World Bank,Recovery and Reconstruction,7 Mar 2022,"**WASHINGTON, March 7, 2022—**The World Bank Board of Executive Directors today approved a supplemental budget support package for Ukraine, called Financing of Recovery from Economic Emergency in Ukraine – or FREE Ukraine – for $489 million. The package approved by the Board consists of a supplemental loan for $350 million and guarantees in the amount of $139 million and is also mobilizing grant financing of $134 million and parallel financing of $100 million, resulting in total mobilized support of $723 million. The fast-disbursing support will help the government provide critical services to Ukrainian people, including wages for hospital workers, pensions for the elderly, and social programs for the vulnerable., The initial World Bank support was increased with guarantees from the Netherlands for 80 million euros ($89 million equivalent) and Sweden for $50 million. The World Bank has also set up a multi-donor trust fund (MDTF) to facilitate channeling grant resources from donors to Ukraine, with contributions from the UK, Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania, and Iceland in the amount of $134 million thus far. The World Bank is calling for further grant contributions to the MDTF. In addition, Japan is linking $100 million in parallel financing to the support package., Consolidation of development support is critical for streamlining approval processes and maximizing impact., “The World Bank Group is taking quick action to support Ukraine and its people in the face of the violence and extreme disruption caused by the Russian invasion,” said World Bank President David Malpass.*** “The World Bank Group stands with the people of Ukraine and the region. This is the first of many steps we are taking to help address the far-reaching human and economic impacts of this crisis.”*, The World Bank Group is preparing a $3 billion package of support for Ukraine in the coming months and additional support to neighboring countries receiving Ukrainian refugees. According to UNHCR, since the onset of the invasion, 1.7 million Ukrainians – primarily women, children, and elderly – have fled to neighboring countries. Medium and long-term support will be needed for the provision of public services, both for refugee and host communities, and labor market access for refugees., The World Bank’s overall portfolio of projects in Ukraine supports improvements in basic public services, in areas such as water supply, sanitation, heating, power, energy efficiency, roads, social protection, education and healthcare, as well as private sector development. Since Ukraine joined the World Bank in 1992, the Bank’s commitments to the country have totaled more than $14 billion in about 90 projects and programs., PRESS RELEASE NO: 2022/ECA/66, Contacts, David Theis, +1 (202) 458-8626, dtheis@worldbankgroup.org, Carl Hanlon, +1 (202) 460-8526, chanlon@worldbank.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/world-bank-mobilizes-emergency-financing-package-over-700-million-ukraine-enukru

Water Sanitation Hygiene",8 Mar 2022,"Overview, The Russian Federation’s military offensive in Ukraine has triggered one of the fastest-growing refugee emergencies on record. More than 1.5 million people have fled across Ukraine’s borders within 10 days and many tens of thousands more have been displaced within the country in what is an extremely volatile security and humanitarian situation., Populations in need, Prior to the military offensive, Ukrainian authorities had registered 1.46 million internally displaced people (IDPs), of whom 854,000 resided in Government-controlled areas, in addition to 1.7 million conflict-affected people. Most had been displaced since the initial outbreak of hostilities in south-east Ukraine in 2014. There were also 35,000 stateless persons and 5,000 refugees and asylum seekers, mainly from Afghanistan, whose need of UNHCR’s assistance is expected to become only more acute in the unfolding situation. There are two main groups now identified for assistance: IDPs inside Ukraine, and refugees from Ukraine who have sought safety abroad, the majority of whom are women and children. The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) projects that the military offensive could displace up to 6.7 million people within Ukraine, 4.3 million of whom will need life-saving humanitarian assistance. Under this Supplementary Appeal, UNHCR will assist 2.1 million IDPs for an initial period of three months, in line with the timeline of the Humanitarian Flash Appeal. As part of the HCT, UNHCR has taken steps to ensure the safety and security of its staff, and those of its partners, so as to stay and deliver protection, shelter, core relief items and cash to meet basic needs. UNHCR also declared a Level 3 emergency in Ukraine on 25 February 2022, signalling an exceptional whole-of-UNHCR response to the crisis. This appeal will also assist 2.4 million refugees. Within 10 days of the start of the military offensive, more than 1.5 million refugees had arrived in neighbouring Hungary, the Republic of Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Some continued onward to other European countries and beyond. UNHCR estimates that over 4 million refugees may flee Ukraine to seek safety in the six months from the military offensive. Due to the circumstances of the crisis, the majority of refugees are women and children.On 25 February, UNHCR declared a Level 2 emergency in the Republic of Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and other affected countries to reinforce its refugee operations., Funding requirements, UNHCR is urgently seeking an initial $510 million for the humanitarian response outlined in this Supplementary Appeal., Inside Ukraine, UNHCR’s additional financial requirements for three months are $270 million. In addition, depending on the scale of the refugee outflow and the response of countries in the region, UNHCR will require $240 million for six months’ response in Hungary, the Republic of Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and other affected countries. UNHCR appeals to the donor community to support people in dire need in Ukraine and in the neighbouring countries at this critical moment.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-unhcr-supplementary-appeal-2022

Diana Oberoi 202.286.1421 (O), **FAIRFIELD, Conn. (March 8, 2022)—**An estimated one million children have fled Ukraine in recent weeks, as the total number of refugees fleeing Ukraine reached 2 million people today. A growing number of these children are arriving on their own, without family support, in an escalating child protection crisis., Reports from the border suggest that some children are arriving unaccompanied after being sent by family members who were unable to leave Ukraine but wanted their children to be safe from ground attack and aerial explosions. Others have been separated from their families in the chaos of fleeing their homes. Many of the solo arrivals are under 14 and showing signs of psychological distress., Save the Children is working to establish family tracing and reunification procedures with other agencies to help reunite children with extended family and friends in Poland and neighboring countries, as well as to establish child protection systems and reporting mechanisms to keep children safe., Irina Saghoyan, Save the Children’s Eastern Europe Director, said:, “Parents are resorting to the most desperate, heart-breaking measures to protect their children. This includes sending their children away with neighbors and friends to seek safety outside of Ukraine, while they stay home to protect their homes., “Separation can mean profound psychological stress from uncertainty, and fear for family members and separation anxiety. It also increases risks of violence, exploitation, trafficking, and abuse. Many of these separated children are travelling with their older siblings or extended families. Others are travelling with neighbors or other adults. They are in need of protection and support and still incredibly vulnerable., “All efforts must be made to prevent the separation of children from their caregivers and to ensure immediate family tracing and reunification where separation occurs. We know that the quicker we act the most likely it is to successfully reunify children with their caregivers. We will continue to respond where we are most needed and where children need urgent protection.”, Save the Children is calling on border authorities and humanitarian actors to put measures in place to keep children with their primary caregivers, provide child-centered psychosocial support and implement programming to prevent separation. These services must include child-friendly spaces, child-friendly information, family tracing and reunification, and maternal health support., Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, providing humanitarian aid to children and their families. This includes supporting access to education, distributing winter and hygiene kits, and providing cash grants to families. Our specialists support children to overcome the mental and psychological impacts of their experiences of conflict and violence and increase their ability to cope with stress in their daily lives., Save the Children believes every child deserves a future.

"As over 1.5 million people flee Ukraine, women and children at increased risk of exploitation and abuse, warns IRC",News and Press Release,IRC,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",7 Mar 2022,"New York, NY, March 7, 2022 — The International Rescue Committee (IRC) warns that of the over 1.5 million refugees that have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion, the vast majority are women and children at grave risk of violence, exploitation and abuse. The speed of displacement seen in this crisis is unprecedented. We have not seen displacement taking place at such a pace since the Rohingya crisis. As the numbers of displaced people grow daily, the UN warns that up to 5 million people could flee the country - making this the biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War II. In crisis settings, women and girls face particular and disproportionate risks -- including of violence, exploitation and abuse - during conflict and displacement. Women and girls fleeing Ukraine will be no different., Lani Fortier, Director of Delivery in Emergencies at the IRC, said,, ""We are extremely concerned for the safety and security of women and children who have been forced to flee their homes. In addition to the over 1.5 million people who have fled from Ukraine since the Russia invasion, there were already nearly 1.5 million people before last week - two-thirds who are women and children - that had become displaced within the country since the start of conflict in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea in 2014., ""Women and girls, especially those traveling alone from and in Ukraine, could be at risk of exploitation and abuse, including sexual violence, gender-based violence, and trafficking. The lack or disruption of essential services, such as emergency medical services, health care, and social services, puts women and girls at a greater risk of adverse health outcomes. An estimated 80,000 women will give birth in the next three months in Ukraine -- many of them without access to critical maternal health care if the crisis continues to shut down essential services. For some, childbirth will be a life-threatening rather than a life-changing experience."", The IRC is calling for international donors and leaders to prioritize the support and protection services of women and girls. This means listening to Ukrainian women and girls themselves and including women's rights organizations in all affected countries in coordinating and implementing the humanitarian response so that we ensure the particular needs of women and girls are taken into account from the very outset of this emergency. It is imperative that safe and regular pathways are opened for all those seeking safety, regardless of their race, nationality, gender and religion. In Poland, where over 885,000 refugees have arrived since the 24th of February, the IRC is working with partners to scale up services for those that need it most and for the protection of women and children.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/over-15-million-people-flee-ukraine-women-and-children-increased-risk-exploitation

However, we believe the exact figures are likely to be much higher as ongoing hostilities have hindered our ability to verify possible cases in many parts of the country., Most of the civilian casualties are from airstrikes and explosive weapons used by Russian forces with wide area effects, including heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems. As a result, hundreds of residential buildings in many cities, including Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Mariupol and Kyiv have been damaged and destroyed., We are alarmed by numerous reports of threats and actual harm against journalists. On 1 March, one journalist was killed in the attack at the TV Tower in Kyiv, and CNNTurk has reported that one of its vehicles was hit by weapons fire but that thankfully their reporter and cameraperson who were inside the vehicle were unhurt., We are also concerned by reports of arbitrary detention of perceived pro-Ukrainian people in areas that have recently come under the control of armed groups in the east and by reports of violence against those considered to be pro-Russian in Ukrainian government-controlled territories., Across the border in Russia, some 12,700 people have been arbitrarily arrested for holding peaceful anti-war protests, and new criminal code amendments introduce heavy fines and prison terms of up to 15 years for disseminating information deemed fake by the authorities or discrediting the Russian armed forces.

Ukraine: “A race against time” in Odessa,News and Press Release,MSF,Health,8 Mar 2022,"Carla Melki, emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), has just returned from the port city of Odessa in southern Ukraine. She was part of an MSF team assessing the situation in order to help plan our emergency operations in response to the escalating war in Ukraine. In this interview, Melki explains the fears caused by the Russian military offensive and the priorities for MSF’s intervention. She is speaking from neighboring Moldova, where many Ukrainian refugees are seeking safety., What is the situation in Odessa?, Part of the population fled the city towards the Moldovan border. Those who remain do not move much. Moving around is complicated due to the traffic jams around the very many Ukrainian security forces checkpoints in the city. There is a curfew at night and sirens sound several times a day. While we were there, we heard several explosions in the distance, but we did not know what caused them or where they came from., Most shops are closed, the sale of alcohol is prohibited, fuel is rationed, and cash withdrawals are limited., The city is clearly preparing for an attack and a siege. With nearly one million inhabitants, Odessa is the third biggest city in Ukraine. It is also home to one of the country's most strategic ports. So no one has any illusions about what will happen next. Everyone is preparing for the worst., **How is the city's health system preparing for the Russian military offensive? **
We visited the hospitals that are designated to receive injured civilians. These are large hospitals, of good standard, well equipped, but they are not accustomed to dealing with massive influxes of war wounded or people injured by shrapnel. It's as if hospitals in France, for example, were preparing to practice war medicine.... It's very difficult to approach this facet of medicine theoretically. You have to have practical experience., However, the vast majority of health personnel are still present [in Odessa] and have no intention of leaving. Everyone is working hard and determined to cope, whatever happens., **Should we fear drug shortages? **
The health care system has already been disrupted by war, and the impact is already being felt in supply chains. As an example, the delivery of hot meals for hospital patients has been disrupted. The fighting prevented deliveries from the city of Mykolaiv where they were normally prepared. As a result, we are wondering whether to support the hospitals by providing ready meals for patients., Some medicines are also starting to run short. It is not possible to order them through the usual channels because the central level is no longer able to supply the whole country. Each region or large city tries to find alternatives. We are helping with this: a first donation of medicines and medical equipment arrived yesterday [Sunday, March 6] in Odessa from Romania, and we are hoping to donate some of it to hospitals in Mykolaiv. But clearly, across the country, the lack of medicines and equipment is already a huge problem, and the situation is only going to get worse., In addition to the direct consequences of the war, the impact for patients suffering from chronic diseases---cancer or diabetes, for example---is likely to be disastrous., **What is the situation on the Moldovan border? **
According to the Moldovan authorities, approximately 120,000 refugees from Ukraine have already arrived in the country. For residents of the Odessa region, the nearest border crossing is Palanca, about two hours by car from the city. But currently, it sometimes takes more than 24 hours to cross the border. At the border post, the Moldovan authorities separate their nationals from other nationalities, but everyone is allowed to pass., The wealthiest people travelled by car, while many others fled by bus and train. The vast majority are women and children. Near the border, traffic jams of several kilometers have formed. Many people choose to cover the last few kilometers on foot. It is very cold. As well as fatigue and anxiety, some people are suffering the effects of untreated chronic illnesses., Once they arrive at the border, people often need to receive immediate care. We intend to set up a health post in collaboration with the Moldovan Ministry of Health to be able to provide first aid in a safe and warm environment. On the Moldovan side of the border, the authorities have set up reception areas, as it often takes several hours for refugees to find transport to the capital, Chișinău, and beyond. Here, too, we intend to set up a shelter to provide psychological and social assistance, particularly for the most vulnerable., **How does MSF plan to help the people of Odessa? **
In Odessa, we are focusing on two priorities. One, we will help with the preparation of hospitals to take care of the wounded. We believe we can provide training, support for triage, and patient stabilization. We are also considering helping to set up advanced medical posts---small emergency rooms capable of providing first aid to the injured, before transporting them to hospitals., Two, we plan to help with the supply of medicines in order to prevent shortages. After the first donation of medicines yesterday, other donations will follow in the coming days. This is thanks in particular to a partnership with Zidebine, a Romanian [nongovernmental organization] that is helping us to buy and deliver medicines to Ukraine., In either case, we don't know how much time is left before the town is attacked. We are trying to set up as many things as possible, while it is still possible. It's a race against time.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-race-against-time-odessa
Integration of Ukrainian refugees: The road ahead,News and Press Release,ICMPD,"Education
Health
Protection and Human Rights",8 Mar 2022,"Over 1.7 million people have fled across Ukraine’s borders following Russia’s invasion on 24 February. Right now, attention is understandably focused on their entry and reception. But soon the EU will need to consider how to best help these newcomers settle in. Last week’s activation of the Temporary Protection Directive gives (mainly) Ukrainians the right to access key integration-related services and employment. National administrations now face an enormous challenge to make such access a reality., Over 1 million people fled across Ukraine’s borders in the first week following Russia’s invasion, and the latest estimate from UN agencies predicts that 4 million people could be displaced from the country as the conflict continues. Right now, attention is necessarily focused on the entry and reception of those fleeing war in Ukraine – after all, physical safety and humanitarian aid must be the first priorities. But before long, EU Member States will have to think about how to best help newcomers settle in through the provision of integration support. Last week’s activation of the Temporary Protection Directive is an important – and landmark – step that also enables Ukraine’s citizens and long-term residents to access essential integration-related services and to work. We know from past experience that acting early is key to supporting successful integration. With this in mind, some important considerations are:, Who is arriving and where?, With the Ukrainian government requiring men ages 18-60 to stay and support the war effort, it is largely women and children, as well as elderly men, who are currently crossing into the EU. The rapid escalation of conflict meant they needed to leave quickly and had little time to prepare before making their way to the border. It is not only Ukrainian citizens who have had to flee: Students, workers, and refugees from other countries have also been uprooted by the immediate outbreak of conflict. Not all non-Ukrainians will be covered by the Temporary Protection Directive, and for those who are not, Member States will need to determine if they will be able to stay., Over 1.7 million people have fled Ukraine across international borders, with the vast majority heading to neighbouring EU countries (Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania). Meanwhile, Poland, Italy, the Czech Republic, Spain, and Germany are home to the largest Ukrainian communities in the EU (measured in permits at the end of 2020), most of whom came to work. Ukrainians are highly mobile: According to a 2018 survey, one-quarter of Ukrainians reported that they or a family member had previously worked abroad temporarily. Some now leaving Ukraine have networks in particular EU countries and are moving there to join them – and, notably, visa-free travel enables them to do so thus far (in comparison with most other refugees). Such networks are a critical source of help, but additional support will surely be needed – even more so for those with limited social capital to help them settle in., Where will they stay?, Housing is one of the most immediate needs. Facing such a large number of arrivals, neighbouring countries have moved to ready reception spaces, with some using existing asylum reception facilities or building temporary camps and others relying on hotels and guest houses. These facilities will be particularly important for newcomers without family or friends with whom they can stay (who remain a key source of support for those with personal networks). The private sector and private citizens are also stepping up to offer flats for newcomers without a place to stay. And Slovakia is providing financial support for private persons and tourist facilities accommodating Ukrainian citizens (€100 per child and €200 per adult each month). While these options are critical in the first days and weeks, the large number of newcomers is already putting pressure on the local housing stock in some cities, leading to a drop in available accommodation and jump in prices. Arrivals in Poland (1 million as of 6 March) now exceed the population of the country's second largest city, Krakow. Many countries seeing the largest numbers of arrivals already have a dearth of affordable or social housing. More generally, high costs, as well as housing discrimination, remain persistent challenges for many migrants looking for a place to rent., In the wake of the 2015-2016 spike in arrivals, we also saw a range of creative approaches to meeting housing needs, including matching refugees with volunteer hosts and co-housing refugees with local young people and seniors. Such initiatives are typically small in scale, and can thus only make a small dent in the housing need, but they offer important opportunities for cross-cultural interaction and might be further expanded. Increasing financial assistance is another way to help people cope with high or rising housing costs., What physical and mental health care?, Two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, national health systems continue to be under stress. Most immediately, those injured by the conflict will need access to emergency medical attention. Conflict-related challenges, including difficulties with physical distancing and extreme stress, combined with a relatively low vaccination rate among Ukrainians, will likely lead to an increase in COVID-19 infections and result in increased demand for health services. Access to medication is another pressing issue. Due to the demographics of arrivals, there will be particular pressure on health care for the elderly, children, and women, including expectant mothers. Thus far, receiving countries have focused on serving arrivals using mainstream health care systems rather than creating parallel ones, which is a positive development., But as important as it is, physical health is not the only concern. As we have seen in the headlines, peoples’ lives were literally upended overnight, with some waiting as many as 60 hours in the freezing cold in lines many kilometres long to cross to safety. Meanwhile, especially with most men required to remain in Ukraine, families are separated, with those in Europe fearing for the safety of their loved ones back home. Such stressful situations are why mental health and psychosocial support are an essential component of humanitarian interventions – and why they should also be a key part of integration approaches. However, Europe’s mental health systems are underdeveloped, plagued by chronic underinvestment. Care is difficult for general populations to access, and even more challenging for refugees and other migrants. It will be critical to ramp up funding significantly for clinical mental health services to support newcomers in coping with trauma, alongside non-clinical approaches in partnership with schools, community-based organisations, and others., How to incorporate new arrivals into education systems?, School-age children constitute a large share of arriving Ukrainian refugees, pointing to massive implications for school systems in the middle of the school year. Member States have already begun efforts to channel children into mainstream education systems, but the sudden incorporation of large numbers of refugee children poses a range of challenges. It might stretch school system capacities at the institutional level and hurt teacher-student ratios. Children often face difficulties beyond simply doing their homework, including adjusting to a new school, coping with trauma, dealing with language barriers, and navigating curriculum differences. Teachers are often insufficiently trained on addressing these challenges. Various approaches are now being assessed, including creating special classes for Ukrainian children to transition into Polish classrooms and hiring Ukrainian-speaking staff. Meanwhile, we should not forget about students whose university education was also interrupted. While in theory Ukrainian students have access to state higher education, additional support, including stipends or housing allowances, might be necessary, while it is unclear to what extent credits will transfer. It is also unclear how many non-Ukrainian students will be able to access EU higher education and how many plan to return to their countries of origin., How to overcome language barriers?, Some Ukrainians already speak Hungarian or Romanian as their native language, while personal networks and language proximity with other Slavic languages (e.g. Polish, Slovak, and Czech) may lessen language barriers that can hinder migrants from being aware of or accessing needed services. However, there will still be considerable and immediate demand for interpreters and translators. And in the longer term, language classes will be important for supporting adults in settling in and navigating their new communities, while children can receive assistance in schools. For those in or looking for work, job-related vocabulary and employer-based language classes are particularly useful approaches., How to integrate arrivals into the labour market?, Facilitating labour market access is traditionally a central focus of integration policy, and is also crucial considering newcomers’ limited financial resources and current challenges converting money into local currencies. Employers in a number of EU Member States remain optimistic about the absorption capacities of their labour markets, announcing that they can easily accommodate anywhere from 100,000 (Slovakia) to 500,000 (Poland) additional workers. Private sector initiatives offering jobs, combined with additional support (e.g. housing) to newly arrived refugees, have been mushrooming. Indeed, labour shortages mean there may be more opportunities – but most likely not everyone will enter the labour market so easily. In addition to language-related challenges, it is largely women, children, and seniors arriving, meaning that a significant share of newcomers may not have been active in the Ukrainian labour market and may not be in the EU either. And for caregivers, child and elderly care may be a precondition for employment. While some might indeed become economically self-sustaining quickly, vulnerable refugees will require long-term support. However, the countries receiving them are largely not welfare states., The challenges go far beyond simple job matching, although the question remains whether the profiles of potential workers will match available vacancies. For instance, in addition to shortages of lower skilled workers, the Polish labour market has been struggling with a large deficit of workers with specific qualifications. Ukraine has a well-educated labour force, but ‘brain waste’ is a persistent problem among refugees, and education in Ukraine lags behind labour market developments. Even if it may be relatively easy to channel lower skilled workers into the labour market, those with higher qualifications might find it more challenging due to difficulties getting these recognised (especially if they did not manage to bring documentation of their skills when they fled). Since 2015, Europe has recognised the importance of validating informal and non-formal skills early on and recognising foreign qualifications so that refugees are able to capitalise on their skills. For policymakers looking to do this and simultaneously fill shortage positions, Sweden’s Fast Track initiative can provide inspiration. Policymakers must also address working conditions and mitigate the risks of exploitation., On the bright side, it may be easier for Ukrainians joining their networks to find jobs through these connections. Additionally, the ability of Ukrainians to travel within the EU means that they can theoretically go where they speak the language or feel they have the most opportunities. This is something most other refugees are not able to do., How do public attitudes enter the equation?, Public attitudes towards refugees and migrants shape the welcome newcomers will receive and also influence local and national policies affecting them. Across the EU, the outpouring of support for Ukrainians has been remarkable. This does not necessarily mean, though, that it will stay this way, as we have seen in other cases. It is not just time, but also the scale of arrivals, that can shift public opinion. The head of UNHCR has already warned that European hospitality may diminish over time. That tensions are likely to appear sooner or later is another reason why addressing integration is so important. For Ukrainians moving to Eastern Europe, linguistic and cultural similarities may prove helpful in pre-empting such tensions, but there is no guarantee. It is not only newcomers who will need to adapt, and promoting local engagement will therefore be paramount. And for people belonging to racial and ethnic minorities, there have already been reports of difficulties entering EU territory, which come on top of long-standing challenges regarding discrimination against migrants and members of racial, ethnic, and religious minorities. It is clear that efforts to tackle discrimination and strategic communication will have important roles to play., A unique situation, While much about the unfolding conflict remains uncertain, we do know that, when it ends, it will take time to recover. And even if return becomes possible, some will wish to stay in the EU, as seen for instance with many Bosnians remaining in Austria after the war ended. More immediately, we do not know the full scale of displacement or in which Member State people will settle. It is not just these dynamics, but also individual profiles and local contexts, that will shape integration considerations, needs, and responses., While many of the current destination countries have increasingly realised the importance of comprehensive immigration policies, there is still considerable room for improvement in various integration policy areas. Moreover, integration policy in Eastern Europe is largely projectised, pointing to the need to shift to a long-term and holistic approach. Finding the right balance between mainstream and tailored supports will be key in the coming weeks and months. And while national authorities are taking the lead on reception facilities and call the shots regarding legal status and integration, it is cities that play a key role in helping newcomers settle in., The EU can and should play a supportive role for Member States – and for EU funding to have an immediate impact, it needs to be flexible in order to respond to different national, regional, and local contexts. It is clear that all levels of government will require an injection of funding to provide all of the above support – for instance, Poland foresees needing €350-€700 million. The EU can also bring together those countries that received large-scale arrivals in the recent past — such as Germany, Sweden, and Austria — with those doing so today to exchange experiences and good practices., The scale of arrivals would test any EU Member State – and many of these countries have relatively short experience receiving immigrants. In many ways, the current situation differs from previous large-scale refugee arrivals – not least because Ukrainians across the board were granted the right to work, stay, and access services almost immediately. Also important, they are thus far allowed to move within the EU to link up with their networks. And many have already worked or studied in the EU. But that is not to say it will be easy. Europe has seen an amazing mobilization, with an outpouring of aid from civil society, the private sector, and individuals – and this is exactly what is needed for such a large undertaking. For integration to be successful, it is critical that this goodwill stands the test of time., Authors, Justyna Segeš Frelak, 4 Publications - See all Publications, Caitlin Katsiaficas, 9 Publications - See all Publications, Downloads, Integration of Ukrainian refugees: The road ahead, 08 March 2022, (EN) DOWNLOAD",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/integration-ukrainian-refugees-road-ahead
Providing healthcare for civilians in and refugees beyond Ukraine is our top priority [EN/RU],News and Press Release,WHO,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",8 Mar 2022,"Statement by WHO Regional Director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, Copenhagen, 8 March 2022, It is now 13 days since the military offensive began in Ukraine, and today within the country we see a health system under severe pressure, and beyond its borders the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe for more than 75 years., In these difficult days WHO’s priorities are threefold:, Firstly, we are working to get the health supplies that are needed into Ukraine, and ensure a sustainable system of “safe passage” for the delivery of humanitarian health supplies to where they are needed within the country. I have been working closely with Amin Awad, Assistant Secretary-General and UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, to establish such a route. Lifesaving essential medicines, such as oxygen and insulin, personal protective equipment, surgical supplies, anesthetics, and safe blood products, are in short supply. So far, two shipments totaling 76 tonnes of trauma and emergency health supplies, as well as freezers, refrigerators, ice packs, and cool boxes are in transit in Ukraine. We have further shipments of 500 oxygen concentrators and more supplies are on their way, A second priority is to ensure that neighbouring countries have the infrastructure and expertise in place to meet the urgent health needs of those arriving. According to UNHCR, more than 1.7 million people, the vast majority women and children, have left Ukraine since 24 February. All those seeking refuge, including third-country nationals who had been residing in Ukraine, must be granted movement across Europe., We have deployed expert WHO teams to Hungary, Poland, the Republic of Moldova and Romania – and we are working with UNHCR and coordinating closely with the relevant governments, local authorities and partners to assess the needs of incoming refugees upon entry at the border, build health system capacity to accommodate large numbers of refugees and ensure access to services. WHO emergency response partner networks have also been mobilized, with 20 emergency teams already on the ground and more than 25 more poised to support., I oversaw the arrival of the first shipment of WHO supplies, and had the opportunity to meet a few of the people who had recently arrived from Ukraine when I visited the border area of Rzeszow in Poland last Thursday. I saw more than exhaustion and relief. Looking into people’s eyes – there is uncertainty and anguish among children and women. Their health needs encompass services for vaccine preventable diseases, maternal, newborn and child health, non-communicable diseases, HIV and TB, and not least, mental health and psychosocial support. Let me add that the welcome they have received from local people and health care staff has been phenomenal., Next week, we will be holding a long-planned meeting on refugee and migrant health in Turkey. This meetingwill bring together health ministers, representatives of refugee and migrant groups, partner organizations and the WHO African and Eastern Mediterranean regions, to address current events, but also look beyond the current situation. Through political commitment and partnership, we seek to establish a new vision for the health of refugees and migrants, across the European Region and further afield. This meeting will be an opportunity to take account of current needs in a longer-term context, recognizing the potential of migration to contribute to thriving, healthy populations and to ensure an economy of well-being for all., Our third focus at this moment is to provide support on immediate health requirements within Ukraine through a fully-functioning WHO operations centre on the ground in Ukraine. We are responding to the urgent need for trauma and injury support with rapid refresher training, supplies and staffing through the mobilization of medical teams., Continuity of care for those with long-term health needs is a major challenge because broken supply lines are affecting the treatment of conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, as well as for cancer., According to UNFPA, an estimated 80,000 women will give birth in the next three months without access to critical maternal care., Re-establishing and maintaining vaccination programmes and continuing treatment for people living with TB and HIV, are priorities, as is the provision of mental health services., We are working to support these essential medical needs though fixed facilities and field hospitals or mobile health services and by making key diagnostics, medicines and medical supplies available., It should not need saying that health workers, hospitals and other medical facilities must never be a target at any time, including during crises and conflicts. To date, we have 16 confirmed reports of attacks in Ukraine, and more are being verified. WHO strongly condemns these attacks on health care services., Today is International Women’s Day, a moment when we should be celebrating the myriad ways in which women improve the world we all live in – including as green entrepreneurs, health pioneers, community champions and political role-models. But as events unfold in eastern Europe, I must recognize their leadership and the need for their voice in this crisis., Women are the key responders in this humanitarian emergency., Before 24 February, 71% of households in the conflict areas in Ukraine were already headed by women, and now these numbers are increasing every day. They make up 83% of the country’s health workforce. Women are the breadwinners whilst caring for children and the frail. They are organizing and distributing assistance and aid. And they are risking their lives to deliver life-saving health services., In conflict situations, and when displaced, women face specific risks and have particular health needs.
Past conflicts have shown us that adolescent girls, women with disabilities and elderly women are in the most vulnerable situation. They face an increased risk of suffering attacks by people outside the home and by armed groups, as well as intimate partner violence and sexual abuse and exploitation., The health needs of women and girls, including emergency obstetric care, maternal health, reproductive health, and response to sexual and gender-based violence must be prioritized., Women are key players in reducing conflict and advancing stability as their participation increases the chances of ensuring lasting conflict resolutions and peace, yet they almost always remain absent from negotiations., On this International Women’s Day, I express my deep appreciation for their invaluable contribution to health and well-being today and every day. And I will work to ensure that the specific health needs of women and girls are embedded in the response to this humanitarian crisis., Let me now provide a brief update on the COVID-19 situation in Ukraine and across the European Region., Remarkably, despite the events that have unfolded, Ukraine has maintained its COVID-19 surveillance and response system. I commend my Ukrainian colleagues in this regard and encourage them to continue. 731 COVID-19 deaths were reported to WHO from Ukraine last week, and sadly this number will increase as oxygen shortages continue. Older people will be disproportionately affected as their access to healthcare is disrupted, and because only one third of the over-60s are fully protected with a complete vaccine series., Across the WHO European Region, cases of COVID-19 are declining week on week, and the number of deaths has also fallen every week since 10 February. While this is good news, I would call on countries to balance optimism with maintaining vaccination and strong vigilance, and ensure that any lifting of public health and social measures including testing, can be reintroduced quickly if and when required., Finally, it is my deepest sorrow to see my Region emerging from two terrible pandemic years being now confronted with the devastating impact of military hostilities on millions of people in Ukraine and beyond. Through personal experience in other conflicts, I firmly believe that health and humanitarian principles remain key drivers of peace and I am using all diplomatic resources that are at my disposal as elected WHO leader to reduce the impact of this human catastrophe., ENDS, This statement was delivered to the press on 8 March 2022, *eupress@who.int *",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/providing-healthcare-civilians-and-refugees-beyond-ukraine-our-top-priority-enru

Ukraine: Russian Assault Kills Fleeing Civilians [EN/RU],Analysis,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,8 Mar 2022,"Continuous Shelling of Evacuation Route Suggests Laws of War Violations, For several hours on March 6, 2022, Russian forces bombarded an intersection on a road that hundreds of civilians were using to flee the Russian army’s advance in northern Ukraine to Kyiv, Human Rights Watch said today. The repeated nature of the attacks, which according to the government killed at least eight civilians, suggests that Russian forces violated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians, and failed to take all feasible measures to avoid civilian casualties., According to witnesses, about a dozen Ukrainian security force members and at least two military vehicles were at the intersection during the attack, but they were vastly outnumbered by the large number of fleeing civilians. Some security forces were helping the civilians carry their luggage and children. Witnesses described hearing and seeing exchanges of fire between Ukrainian and Russian forces not in the immediate vicinity of the intersection, but at some distance away. While other witnesses could not be precise about where the exchanges of fire took place, the New York Times, which had journalists on the scene, reported that Ukrainian forces fired mortar rounds in the direction of the Russian forces from a military position about 180 meters from the intersection. Nevertheless, explosive projectiles fired by Russian forces repeatedly hit the intersection., “Scores of civilians fleeing northern Ukraine to escape Russian shelling and potential occupation found themselves victims of yet another Russian assault,” said Richard Weir, crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The hours-long bombardment on a location with evacuating civilians raises concerns that Russian forces were conducting indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks, and failing to take all feasible precautions to minimize civilian casualties.”, Human Rights Watch research and analysis suggests that the projectiles used in the bombardment were possibly observed, meaning that Russian forces were likely tracking or “observing” where they were landing, and that Russian forces had information they could use to adjust targeting. If this is the case, the persistent shelling harming civilians rather than hitting larger military objectives some distance away points to potential recklessness or deliberateness., Human Rights Watch interviewed seven people who were present during the attacks on March 6, including five linked to the media and two civilians who were evacuating, and analyzed one video of a projectile hitting the intersection and six photographs of the aftermath. According to the local mayor, eight people were killed, including two children. Human Rights Watch gathered information about four people killed during the shelling, including two children, from witness accounts and analysis of photos and videos., From about 9:30 a.m. until 2 p.m. local time, witnesses described continuous bombardment on the P30 road, which runs from northwestern Ukraine to Kyiv. Until March 5, civilians had been taking the train from Irpin station into Kyiv to escape the fighting, but the railway tracks were damaged in an attack that day. As a result, on March 6, hundreds of civilians fleeing areas north of Kyiv used the P30 road to reach Kyiv, from which they hoped to travel onward., The intersection is six kilometers from the Kyiv city limits, south of Irpin, just in front of St. George’s Ukrainian Orthodox Church and a statue commemorating those who fought in World War II. The intersection is also just south of a bridge that the Ukrainian forces destroyed to deter the Russian advance., Before and during the attack, witnesses described a steady stream of civilians walking on the rubble of the destroyed bridge to cross the Irpin River. People then gathered at the intersection to board buses or cars heading into central Kyiv, or continued walking., As the assault began, one witness, who was at the intersection from 9:30 a.m. until noon, said a projectile hit the intersection or the surrounding area every 10 minutes. “The Russians were raining mortar shells into the area,” he said. “People were running in all directions to escape the shelling.” He said he saw a few Ukrainian soldiers in the area and two trucks that appeared to be used by the security forces, but no other significant military equipment. In a video of the attack that was widely circulated online, a dark green vehicle is seen that may have been a Ukrainian military vehicle., One civilian, who passed through the area at about 10:30 a.m., said that he saw two armored vehicles, one with a machine gun mounted on top, and about eight security force members. As he passed through, he witnessed the detonation of six incoming projectiles from the directions of Irpin and Stoyanka, where Russian troops were located., Another civilian who passed through at 10 a.m. estimated that she saw five incoming projectiles detonate and said she heard a sixth explode just as she had boarded a cargo minivan without windows. She said the driver hit the gas right as the explosion happened next to the minivan, driving off with the back doors open. Both said they did not see Ukrainian forces at, or around, the immediate vicinity firing on Russian positions at any point as they were passing through., At 1:29 p.m., the local online media outlet Donbas Frontliner posted one video and six photographs to its Instagram account, which Human Rights Watch reviewed. The video, which was filmed by a freelance journalist working with the New York Times, shows an armed member of the citizen volunteer Territorial Defense Forces – identifiable from his yellow armband – standing beside a fence on the P30 road. At least a dozen people are pulling suitcases and leading pets. Suddenly a whooshing sound is heard, and then a flash and a loud explosion. A few seconds later, the member of the Territorial Defense Forces has been thrown to the ground and is being helped away. Two men in uniform run over to four other bodies on the ground, and then a third person standing nearby shouts, “Medic, medic!”, One of the photographs shows the scene by St. George’s church with the four bodies in civilian clothes on the ground, surrounded by two pieces of luggage and a transport box for a small animal. Another photograph shows what appears to be a dead man on a stretcher next to a supermarket parking lot opposite the church. Human Rights Watch could not confirm whether this photo was taken at that time, or during a previous round of shelling in Irpin., Maxim Dondyuk, a freelance journalist, arrived at the site at about noon and stayed in the area for about two hours. He said the Russian forces fired projectiles at the intersection and surrounding area every 5 to 10 minutes. When one explosion went off at about 2 p.m., a metal fragment hit Dondyuk in the right shoulder, wounding him. He said civilians kept arriving on foot from the direction of the destroyed bridge and then packed into cars, trying to head south. He also said that the only military presence he saw was about 10 members of the Ukrainian security forces., Over the past several days, Russian and Ukrainian forces have held talks to discuss opening safe routes of evacuation for civilians in areas across Ukraine affected by heavy fighting, but these efforts have failed. On March 3, in the second round of talks, both sides agreed in principle to establish humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of “peaceful” civilians and delivery of medicine and food to the areas most affected by the conflict., However, as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) emphasized, the absence of a detailed and functioning agreement meant that shelling continued in places despite planned evacuation attempts, and authorities had to cancel them. No specific agreements have been reached between the parties to date about a temporary ceasefire or humanitarian corridor for civilians seeking to flee from northern Ukraine, such as those caught up in Russian shelling just outside of Kyiv on March 6., The laws of war require the parties to a conflict to take constant care during military operations to spare the civilian population and to “take all feasible precautions” to avoid or minimize civilian harm and damage to civilian objects. These precautions include doing everything feasible to verify that the objects of attack are military objectives and not civilians or civilian objects and giving “effective advance warning” to civilians when circumstances permit., Parties to the conflict should take all feasible steps to remove the civilian population from the vicinity of fighting or military objects. The laws of war prohibit deliberate, indiscriminate, or disproportionate attacks on civilians. Those responsible for deliberate or reckless attacks that harm civilian objects can be prosecuted for war crimes., The Ukrainian forces also have an obligation to take all feasible precautions to avoid or minimize civilian harm. Such precautions include avoiding operating from an area where civilians and civilian objects are located and preventing civilians from entering areas of active hostilities., The use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas heightens concerns of unlawful, indiscriminate, and disproportionate attacks. These weapons have a large destructive radius, are inherently inaccurate, or deliver multiple munitions at the same time. This includes the use of unguided and unobserved large-caliber projectiles, which may also have been used in the Irpin attack on March 6. The use of these weapons should be avoided in populated areas., The International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into the situation in Ukraine. The civilian deaths in Irpin underline the importance of the court’s scrutiny. The Commission of Inquiry established on March 4 by the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva should investigate alleged unlawful attacks in Irpin., “Both sides in this conflict have an obligation to take all feasible steps to avoid civilian harm and to allow the civilian population to evacuate safely,” Weir said. “International investigations should send a message to those responsible for reckless, indiscriminate attacks that they could one day face justice.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russian-assault-kills-fleeing-civilians-enru
Russia/Ukraine: Prisoners of war must be protected from public curiosity under Geneva Convention,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,7 Mar 2022,"Prisoners of war in the Russian invasion of Ukraine must have their rights respected under the Third Geneva Convention, Amnesty International said today., In recent days, the Ukrainian authorities have brought Russian prisoners of war to press conferences to discuss their roles in the military invasion, and videos on social media have also shown captured soldiers contacting family members in Russia., Videos of captured Ukrainian soldiers have also appeared on social media, though it is not yet clear if these have official sanction., “As the conflict continues, it is essential that all parties to the conflict fully respect the rights of prisoners of war,” said Joanne Mariner, Director of Amnesty International’s Crisis Response Programme., “Any public appearances can put prisoners of war at risk when they are returned to their home country, and also prove problematic for their families whilst they are detained., “Article 13 of the Third Geneva Convention explicitly states that prisoners of war must be protected at all times, particularly from public curiosity. It is duty of the detaining power to ensure these prisoners’ rights are properly respected from the moment they are captured.”, The Geneva Convention, Article 13 of the Third Geneva Convention states: “Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated. Any unlawful act or omission by the Detaining Power causing death or seriously endangering the health of a prisoner of war in its custody is prohibited, and will be regarded as a serious breach of the present Convention. In particular, no prisoner of war may be subjected to physical mutilation or to medical or scientific experiments of any kind which are not justified by the medical, dental or hospital treatment of the prisoner concerned and carried out in his interest. Likewise, prisoners of war must at all times be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity.”, The authoritative commentary by the International Committee of the Red Cross specifies that “any materials that enable individual prisoners to be identified must normally be regarded as subjecting them to public curiosity and, therefore, may not be transmitted, published or broadcast”., Amnesty International has previously called for international humanitarian and human rights law to be respected as the conflict in Ukraine continues to escalate.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/russiaukraine-prisoners-war-must-be-protected-public-curiosity-under-geneva

IOM’s plan is in line with the interagency Flash Appeal for Ukraine and the Regional Refugee Response Plan, which were both launched on 1 March 2022., IOM is requesting USD 250 million for an initial period of three months to meet the needs of over 3.5 million affected people in Ukraine, and USD 100 million over the course of six months to meet the needs of migrants, third country nationals (TCNs) and other types of vulnerable populations, as well as hosting communities in countries neighboring Ukraine, including Belarus, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia., Intervention areas include: water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), shelter/non-food items (NFI), health (including mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS)), cash-based interventions, food security and livelihoods (including integration support), protection (including humanitarian transport), humanitarian border management (HBM), camp coordination and camp management (CCCM), the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), and logistics. IOM has also created a separate Flash Appeal for Ukraine based on its inputs into the inter-agency appeal., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a military operation in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region on 24 February. Since the start of the military operation, major attacks have been reported across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv. Russian troops have quickly expanded their presence across Ukraine, with military clashes ongoing in other major cities: Chernihiv (north), Kharkiv (north-east), Kherson (south), Mariupol (south -east), Mykolaiv (south), Odessa (south-west), Sumy (north), among other cities., Following an increase in hostilities, a fire broke out at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) when a projectile launched by Russian troops hit a building in the vicinity. The NPP remains under Russian control and the fire has since been put out. Continued fighting, including the shelling of civilian buildings and centres, remain a significant challenge to the humanitarian response. Between 24 and 2 March, the OHCHR recorded 802 civilian casualties, including 249 people killed; these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source:
OCHA)., The increasing intensity of the conflict has contributed to growing internal displacement and cross-border movement. As of 4 March, 1.25 million people have left Ukraine and crossed into neighbouring countries. Of concern is the situation of TCNs, as there have been increasing reports of discrimination, xenophobia, and harassment against TCNs while trying to leave Ukraine as well as on the other side of the border. On 3 March, the Justice and Home Affairs Council reached a political agreement on triggering the Temporary Protection Directive, enabling EU Member States to offer persons fleeing the war in Ukraine temporary protection status in the EU, for a renewable period of one year., Critical supplies, including food, medicine and basic hygiene items, are becoming increasingly scarce in the hardest-hit areas, while dwindling cash reserves, empty ATMs and suspended money transfer services have greatly curtailed affected people’s ability to purchase basic goods. In Mariupol, Sartana and Staryi Krym, Ukraine, around 470,000 people remain without access to water (source: OCHA)., Despite the growing operational and security challenges, IOM and other humanitarian organizations remain committed to staying on the ground and responding to growing humanitarian needs and protection risks. UN agencies and humanitarian partners are preparing to scale-up operations for whenever access and security allow for humanitarian operations to be rolled out in the hardest-hit areas.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-2-5-march-2022
Ukraine: Mariupol Residents Trapped by Russian Assault [EN/UK],News and Press Release,HRW,"Health

Water Sanitation Hygiene",7 Mar 2022,"Facilitate Civilians’ Access to Safety; Urgently Restore Water, Electricity, Civilians in Ukraine’s southeastern coastal city of Mariupol have not had access to running water, electricity, or heat since March 2, 2022 when Russian forces surrounded the city, as part of a larger offensive, Human Rights Watch said today., Acute water shortages pose a grave risk to more than 200,000 residents without humanitarian assistance or who are unable to flee to safety. City authorities say that hundreds of civilians have been killed during the fighting, though the full extent of civilian casualties and damage to the city’s infrastructure is unknown due to the continued shelling and limited communications., “Civilians in Mariupol have been trapped in a parched and freezing cold nightmare without electricity for the last six days, living under the constant threat of Russian bombardments,” said Jonathan Pedneault, crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Russian along with Ukrainian forces need to take the necessary steps to allow civilians to safely leave the city and ensure the basic needs are met for civilians who remain.”, A Russian shell reportedly hit the last functioning cellphone tower in Mariupol on March 6, making emergency coordination nearly impossible. Continued shelling has also prevented repairs to damaged electricity, water, communications, and heating infrastructure., Respecting the terms of the ceasefire and humanitarian corridor agreed to on March 4 would allow civilians to evacuate safely, facilitate rapid and unimpeded humanitarian assistance to all civilians in need, and allow for repairs of vital electricity, water, and heating infrastructure, Human Rights Watch said. Three evacuations of civilians planned since March 5 were canceled due to continued fighting., Mariupol, a city of roughly 430,000 people prior to the conflict, sits on the shores of the Azov Sea around the mouth of the heavily polluted Kalmius River. Municipal authorities have said that the drinking water system relies on stations pumping groundwater, which requires electricity. Water treatment plants in Mariupol also require electricity., Russian military attacks on the city began on February 24. Shelling has significantly increased since then, as Russian forces moved to encircle the city around March 2. Since then, civilians have been unable to leave Mariupol., Petro Andryushchenko, an assistant to Mariupol’s mayor, told Human Rights Watch on March 5, 6, and 7 that the city has had no electricity, water, or heating since the city was surrounded. “We do not know why, but the electricity system is destroyed and since the water stations need electricity for the pumps, the water system is also damaged,” he said. “We know that there have been rockets that struck near the pumping stations too, but we are unable to send the repair people because of the fighting.” He added that these areas are now under the control of Russian forces., On March 6, the humanitarian medical organization Médecins sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders) said in an audio message that their staff in the city emphasized the urgent need to restore water access. “They don’t know where they can get water,” their emergency coordinator said. “People are drinking rainwater or collecting snow for water. People have literally broken into heating systems to take water from them to be able to wash their hands.”, With current Mariupol weather averaging between -3 and 4 degrees Celsius (27 to 39 degrees Fahrenheit) and no significant precipitation predicted in the coming days, it is crucial to restore the city’s electricity and water supplies to prevent the spread of communicable waterborne disease from ingesting contaminated water. Severe dehydration can lead to hypothermia, leg cramps, delirium, blood pressure loss, organ failure, and death. Children, pregnant women, and older people are more prone to the effects of dehydration., International humanitarian law, or the laws of war, prohibits deliberate and indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian objects and attacks that cause anticipated harm to civilians disproportionate to the expected military benefit. The laws of war do not prohibit sieges by land and blockades by sea of enemy forces so long as they do not cause disproportionate harm to civilians. However, parties to the conflict must allow and facilitate the rapid passage of humanitarian aid for all civilians in need and not arbitrarily interfere with it., Furthermore, all parties to an armed conflict must protect objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, including those necessary for water distribution and sanitation. Parties to the conflict need to ensure civilians’ access to adequate water and sanitation. Starvation as a method of warfare is prohibited., International human rights law also obligates governments and de facto authorities to respect the right to water and ensure that people have sufficient, safe, acceptable, physically accessible, and affordable water for personal and domestic uses. Parties to the conflict urgently need to ensure that water and electricity are supplied to the civilian population in Mariupol and other areas affected by the hostilities without discrimination or unlawful restrictions., “The more than 200,000 civilians trapped in Mariupol face the twin dangers of incessant shelling and an increasingly critical lack of clean water,” Pedneault said. “Parties that are not fulfilling their international legal obligations to urgently address Mariupol’s humanitarian crisis should be held accountable.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-mariupol-residents-trapped-russian-assault-enuk

(Source: FTS), HIGHLIGHTS, • The Ministry of Energy reports that around 650,000 people have been left without electricity and at least 130,000 people remain without natural gas supply in the east, north and south amid ongoing hostilities. Service repair teams require secure “windows of silence” as the rapidly deteriorating security situation prevents them from restoring critical services, including electricity, gas and water., • On 6 March, multiple missile strikes reportedly destroyed Vinnytsia International Airport in central Vinnytsia province, where growing numbers of people displaced by the conflict have fled in search of safety and security, raising concerns that the rapidly expanding geographic scope of the military offensive will generate ever-increasing civilian casualties and humanitarian needs., • As of midnight on 6 March, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports at least 1,207 civilian casualties, including 406 killed. The actual number of civilian casualties is likely to be much higher as civilian deaths and injuries continue to be verified., • Population movements continue internally and across borders. The massive influx of people heading to western Ukraine will likely overwhelm already-stretched national response capacities, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable groups. The number of refugees from Ukraine has exceeded 1.73 million people., • Although many internally displaced people are reportedly staying in private accommodations, a growing number are seeking refuge in collective shelters or centres. These facilities face overcrowded conditions, lack of separation by sex, and poor basic services such as electricity and water, greatly increasing the risk of GBV and COVID-19 transmission. Food and non-food items (NFIs) remain among pressing needs in transit/receptions centres hosting IDPs., SITUATION OVERVIEW, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called yesterday for an immediate pause in fighting to allow civilians to safely evacuate conflict-stricken cities across Ukraine and facilitate the passage of life-saving humanitarian aid to those trapped by increasingly intensified military encirclements, who remain without electricity, water, food or the opportunity to flee an unravelling humanitarian crisis. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says the failure to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people highlights the absence of a detailed and functioning agreement between sides of the conflict that continues to have dire humanitarian consequences., On 6 March, casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure were reported in Chernihiv (north), Bucha, Irpin (capital area), Korosten (Zhytomyrska oblast, north), Mykolaiv (Mykolaivska oblast, south), Okhtyrka (Sumska oblast, north), Ovruch (Zhytomyrska oblast, north), Trostianets (Sumska oblast, north), Kharkiv (north-east), Vinnytsia (Vinnytska oblast, centre) and multiple locations in Government-controlled parts of Luhanska oblast and in non-Government-controlled parts of Donetska oblast, including Donetsk and Horlivka. Kharkiv – a conflict-ravaged city of 1.4 million inhabitants in north-eastern Ukraine – continues to reportedly suffer from airstrikes, causing civilian casualties and damage to critical civilian infrastructure, with active hostilities still ongoing. More than 23,000 people were evacuated from Kharkiv over the last day, while the State Emergency Service reported that at least eight people were killed., Ongoing hostilities have left close to 650,000 people without electricity and at least 130,000 people without natural gas supply – commonly used for cooking and heating amid harsh winter temperatures – across Ukraine, including conflictaffected areas in the eastern, northern and southern parts of the country, according to the Ministry of Energy. Repair teams are working tirelessly to restore these vital services but require secure “windows of silence” to do so, as the rapidly deteriorating security situation prevents them from carrying out repair works., Increasingly violent clashes continue in the outskirts of Kyiv. In Irpin – around 25 km north-west of the capital – a family of four, including two children, were reportedly killed, according to the City Mayor, after the shelling of a checkpoint affected people using it to flee the conflict-ravaged town. In Bucha, Hostomel and Irpin – the former under attack for more than a week – communities remain trapped without water, food and electricity, as local authorities attempt to negotiate “safe passages” to carry out evacuations. Reportedly, around 2,000 civilians have been evacuated from Irpin, according to local police., In Donetska oblast, authorities have evacuated at least 1,500 people from Government-controlled areas (GCA) to the western part of the country. In neighbouring Government-controlled part of Luhanska oblast, a train evacuated more than 2,000 people as cities such as Sievierodonetsk and Popasna have come under increasingly intense attacks in recent days. On 7 March, four evacuation trains were scheduled to depart from Kramatorsk, Donetska oblast (GCA) to Uzhgorod, Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk in the west., The scope and scale of military operations continue to expand, wreaking havoc in parts of Ukraine previously not directly affected by the ongoing conflict. On 6 March, multiple missile strikes destroyed the Vinnytsia International Airport located near the village of Havryshivka in the western part of central Ukraine, where people displaced by the conflict have fled, seeking safety and security in transit/reception centres. As the military offensive begins to create new hotspots of conflict, the risk of rising civilian casualties and wide-scale destruction of critical civilian infrastructure continues to increase., Between 4 a.m. on 24 February and midnight on 6 March, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports at least 1,207 civilian casualties, including 406 killed. The actual number of civilian casualties is likely to be much higher as civilian deaths and injuries continue to be verified. OHCHR reports 528 casualties in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (70 killed and 324 injured in Government-controlled areas and 23 killed and 111 injured in nonGovernment-controlled areas) and 679 civilian casualties in other regions of Ukraine., The current conflict threatens to displace affected people multiple times as its multi-faceted impacts become increasingly felt in new communities every day, creating greater protection risks and exacerbating pre-existing humanitarian needs. As the number of people fleeing the conflict increases – 1.7 million people have fled to neighbouring countries – the massive displacement of people heading to western Ukraine will likely overwhelm already-stretched national response capacities, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable groups in need of assistance, including women and children, people living with disabilities, elderly persons and minority groups., As of 5 March, Protection Cluster monitoring systems found that more than 72,000 new internally displaced people arrived in 14 locations, mostly in western Ukraine but also in Kyiv and some central oblasts to a lesser extent. Although many internally displaced people are reportedly staying in private accommodations, a growing number are seeking refuge in collective shelters, especially in Chernivetska, Dnipropetrovska, Donetska and Kirovohradska oblasts. The people in collective centres face overcrowded conditions, lack of separation by sex or private space for families, and poor basic services such as electricity and water, greatly increasing the risk of gender-based violence (GBV) and COVID-19 transmission. The GBV Sub-Cluster is currently assessing the status of service providers and mapping operational GBV actors, access to services and priority needs. Currently, both food and non-food items (NFIs) remain pressing needs in Government-run transit/receptions centres hosting IDPs, most of whom will continue their journey west in hope of finding greater safety and security within Ukraine or in neighbouring countries.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-7-march-2022

7 MARCH 2022, Millions of Lives Shattered, Emergency Relief Coordinator Says, as Delegates Stress Ceasefire, Safe Humanitarian Corridors Urgently Needed, Alarmed by spreading violence in Ukraine, targeted attacks on civilians, ineffective humanitarian corridors and spiralling risks, briefers and delegates alike called for decisive action to end the conflict, as the Security Council held its seventh meeting in two weeks related to the unfolding situation., [For details on Security Council meetings on the situation in Ukraine since 17 February, see Press Releases SC/14795, SC/14798, SC/14803, SC/14808, SC/14809, SC/14812 and SC/14819.], “Simply put, millions of lives have been shattered,” said Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator. Indeed, the reach of humanitarian efforts can only go so far without the committed cooperation of Ukraine and the Russian Federation to ensure civilian protection and the maintenance of safe corridors for people wanting to escape the violence and those delivering critical aid. Some civilians are unable to escape at a time when 1.7 million have already fled the country since the conflict began on 24 February, while those who remain are facing cuts of essential services. Voicing an extra sense of dread over the impact the conflict will have on the wider world, he expressed deep worry about the consequences on vulnerable people living half a world away, with food prices spiking and supplies uncertain., “We have the capacity and the know-how to meet the most urgent needs in Ukraine, if the parties cooperate, but make no mistake, we are unable to meet the needs of civilians today; I hope we will not fail them tomorrow,” he said, summarizing the widespread ongoing humanitarian efforts alongside enormous and growing needs blanketed by spreading violence. To address the current situation, he highlighted priority areas, which he had already conveyed to Ukraine and the Russian Federation: the parties must take constant care to spare civilians and civilian homes and infrastructure in their military operations; safe passage must be ensured for humanitarian supplies into areas of active hostilities; and a system of constant communication must be established with parties to the conflict, with assurances provided to enable aid deliveries., Providing the latest information on the ground, Catherine Russell, Executive Director of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), called on Security Council members to remind all parties of their legal and moral obligation to protect children and spare them from attack and called for an immediate suspension of ongoing military actions in Ukraine. Half of those fleeing are children and, since 24 February, at least 27 have been killed and 42 wounded, she said, noting that UNICEF and its partners are working to meet rapidly escalating humanitarian needs in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries. Efforts include Fund-supported child protection mobile teams, the delivery of 40 tons of medical life-saving items for children and mothers to 22 hospitals from five of the most affected regions and the launch of “Blue Dot” safe spaces in hosting countries at border crossings, offering psycho-social support, basic legal counselling, recreational kits and hygiene products., “What is happening to children in Ukraine is a moral outrage,” she said, expressing deep concern about the safety and well-being of the nearly 100,000 children, half of them with disabilities, who live in institutions and boarding schools. Moreover, the images of a mother and her two children and a friend lying dead on the street — hit by a mortar as they tried to flee to safety — must “shock the conscience of the world”, she said., In the ensuing debate, Council members agreed that a ceasefire is urgently needed along with safe, guaranteed humanitarian corridors. Many members reiterated strong calls to end the conflict, with some pointing to violated ceasefire agreements brokered by the parties and broken by the Russian Federation. Many condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin for the continued attacks, calling for the immediate withdrawal of Russian armed forces. Some expressed support for the work of the International Criminal Court, emphasizing that perpetrators of war crimes will be held accountable., Describing the Russian Federation’s breaches of humanitarian ceasefires as an abomination, the United Kingdom’s representative declared: “Let me be clear — we will hold Russia to account for its actions and will investigate thoroughly allegations of war crimes and violations of international law.” What the Ukrainian people really need is an end to the invasion, she said, appealing to the Russian Federation to end its war before bringing even more tragedy to Ukraine and even more shame on its proud nation., In a similar vein, the United States delegate, urging parties to heed the call the humanitarian actors just sounded, called on the Russian Federation to accept and honour timebound safe passage in agreed upon locations and a safe communication system to ensure that supplies can reach those most in need. Increasingly concerned about civilian protection, especially of women, girls and other vulnerable groups affected by “Putin’s war”, she said Washington, D.C., has been warning Moscow for weeks that this war will make the Russian Federation weaker, not stronger., The Russian Federation’s representative called on the Security Council to keep to the humanitarian context of what is happening in Ukraine and not rely on Ukrainian politicians and mendacious social networks for their political views. Citing an ongoing disinformation war in the West, he said Ukrainian radicals and neo-Nazis — and not the Russian armed forces — are holding hostages in towns and cities and using civilians as human shields. Russian Federation units had declared a ceasefire that radicals in Mariupol violated, as heard in an intercepted radio conversation instructing them to “shoot at the legs” of those heading for the humanitarian corridors, he said. Further, the deployment of heavy weaponry, including bombardment artillery, has become a rule for Ukrainian nationalist battalions, while radicals are continuing to hold over 1,500 foreigners hostage in multiple cities., Echoing condemnation of the ongoing conflict, Kenya’s delegate also said the impact of the conflict will trigger a shock to the global food supply, given that Ukraine is a major producer. At the same time, the world will suffer greatly from the unilateral and regional sanctions against the Russian Federation. Humanitarian and legal consideration must be given to their frightful impact on the Russian people, a concern that extends to many nations, including Kenya. As such, he cautioned that while the sanctions are aimed at pressuring the Russian Federation for its inexcusable breach of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, they will end up harming innocent Russians and the Global South., Ukraine’s delegate said the Council must be decisive in responding to the worst humanitarian crisis seen since the end of the Second World War in Europe. Raising grave concerns about the reality on the ground, he said the Russian Federation’s troops have blocked numerous attempts of the Ukrainian authorities to evacuate civilians through humanitarian corridors, denied access of international organizations to provide humanitarian assistance to the most affected places, opened fire on evacuees and evacuation vehicles and shelled the roads allocated for safe corridors. Moreover, Moscow has already sent a letter showing humanitarian corridor routes to the Russian Federation and Belarus only, he said, reiterating the call for the previously agreed passages allowing people to leave for Europe. The fragility of the situation reaches beyond Ukraine, into Europe and across the world, he said, adding that defending his country from the Russian Federation’s aggression also protects the world from hunger. He stressed that people in Ukraine require concrete actions to save their lives, their health and their property., Also delivering statements were representatives of Albania, Ireland, Mexico, France, India, Gabon, Brazil, Ghana, Norway, China and the United Arab Emirates., The representative of the Russian Federation took the floor for a second time., The meeting began at 3:06 p.m. and ended at 5:29 p.m., Briefings, MARTIN GRIFFITHS, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, recalling that humanitarian organizations have been working in Ukraine’s Donbas region, providing 1.5 million people with aid for eight years, said the current situation was an unplannable scenario. Yet, the humanitarian community did plan, working with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), International Organization for Migration (IOM) and non-governmental organization partners. As the unthinkable became the reality, the United Nations and its humanitarian partners have started a scalable and agile, adaptable and resilient operation fit for the changing situation, in addition to the Secretary-General’s swift appointment of Amin Awad as his Crisis Coordinator. In the first days of the offensive, his staff, like so many in Ukraine, spent their days and nights working from bunkers and basements, managing to produce the two robust response plans launched last week to a generous donor response., Describing the current situation, he said: “Simply put, millions of lives have been shattered.” People cannot stay home with shops shut, power and water cut, shells falling and phones switched off, and cannot find what they need even if they have money to pay for it, with many not even able to flee in safety. After 11 days of escalating violence, fear and pain, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports at least 1,207 civilian casualties, including at least 406 dead — the real figure could be considerably higher — and UNHCR reports that more than 1.7 million refugees have fled. Humanitarian assistance has continued in all areas where security permits, and under the leadership of the Crisis Coordinator in the country, new plans are being drafted on how to deliver where humanitarian needs are most acute, including in Mariupol, Kharkiv, and Kherson, with scaled up response from hubs in Vinnutsya, Uzhorod and Lviv., The United Nations and partners have already provided food to hundreds of thousands of people, he said. The World Food Programme (WFP) is setting up supply chain operations to deliver immediate food and cash assistance to 3 to 5 million people inside Ukraine; the World Health Organization (WHO) has shipped trauma care and emergency surgery equipment; UNHCR is providing assistance through a network of shops in Mariupol, in collaboration with non-governmental organizations; and the Ukrainian Red Cross has distributed humanitarian assistance to thousands via its emergency stockpiles, including hygiene and food kits, warm clothing and medicine., Saluting those helping, he highlighted three immediate priorities to lessen the pain and suffering — which he has already conveyed to Ukraine and the Russian Federation. First, the parties must take constant care to spare civilians and civilian homes and infrastructure in their military operations, including safe passage to leave areas of active hostilities on a voluntary basis in the direction they choose. Safe passage must also be ensured for humanitarian supplies into areas of active hostilities. Civilians in places like Mariupol, Kharkiv, Melitopol, and elsewhere desperately need aid, especially life-saving medical supplies. Many modalities are possible, but it must take place in line with the parties’ obligations under the laws of war. There is also an urgent need for a system of constant communication with parties to the conflict and assurances to enable the delivery of humanitarian aid, he said, adding that his Office has sent a team to Moscow to work on better humanitarian civil-military coordination that can permit a scale up. Welcoming cooperation by both sides, he expressed sincere hope to see further progress in the hours ahead., People are watching as this unnecessary conflict engulfs cities and civilians, with an extra sense of dread over the impact it will have on the wider world, he said, expressing deep worry about the consequences on vulnerable people living half a world away. Food prices are spiking and supplies uncertain. People in the Sahel, Yemen, the Horn of Africa, Afghanistan, Madagascar and beyond already face profound food insecurity. Record-level fuel prices mean life becomes harder still in places like Lebanon, where generators keep hospitals open and water treatment plants working, he said, stressing that: “We simply cannot afford to have political attention and donor funding diluted, diverted from other pressing humanitarian crises; this may be the latest war, but not the only one.” Reiterating that humanitarian actors have planned, mobilized and fundraised to meet the current challenge, he said: “We have the capacity and the know-how to meet the most urgent needs in Ukraine, if the parties cooperate, but make no mistake, we are unable to meet the needs of civilians today. I hope we will not fail them tomorrow.”, CATHERINE RUSSELL, Executive Director of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), said that the past eight years of conflict in Ukraine have inflicted profound and lasting harm to children. With the escalation of the conflict, the immediate and very real threat to Ukraine’s 7.5 million children has grown. Homes, schools, orphanages and hospitals have all come under attack. Civilian infrastructure like water and sanitation facilities have been hit, leaving millions without access to safe water. For many, life has moved underground as families seek safety in shelters, subways, or basements, often for hours on end. Women are giving birth in makeshift maternity wards with limited medical supplies. As of 7 March, OHCHR recorded 1,207 civilian casualties in Ukraine. Since 24 February, at least 27 children have been killed and 42 have been wounded. As of 6 March, UNHCR was reporting an excess of 1.7 million refugees fleeing to hosting countries. “Half of the people on the move are children,” she said. Noting she had just returned from the Romania-Ukraine border, she said she “met with mothers and children who had to flee their homes at a moment’s notice”. The children talked about being suddenly pulled out of school and “the terrifying sound of shelling and gunfire”., UNICEF and its partners are working to meet rapidly escalating humanitarian needs in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries, she said. UNICEF-supported child protection mobile teams are reaching children with psychosocial care, mental health support and protection services. On Sunday, UNICEF delivered 40 tons of medical life-saving items for children and mothers to 22 hospitals from five of the most affected regions, enough to meet the needs of 20,000 children and their mothers. It has also begun operating “Blue Dot” safe spaces in hosting countries at border crossings where children are first registered. The hubs offer psychosocial support, basic legal counselling, recreational kits and hygiene products. Staff at hubs are also able to identify unaccompanied and separated children, she said, warning of the very high risk of violence, abuse, and exploitation, including trafficking. “Every effort must be made to reunify children with their families,” she said., Inside Ukraine, UNICEF is also deeply concerned about the safety and well-being of the nearly 100,000 children, half of them with disabilities, who live in institutions and boarding schools. “What is happening to children in Ukraine is a moral outrage”, she said, adding that images of a mother and her two children and a friend lying dead on the street — hit by a mortar as they tried to flee to safety — must “shock the conscience of the world”. UNICEF calls upon the members of this Council to remind all parties of their legal and moral obligation to protect children and spare them from attack. She also called for an immediate suspension of ongoing military actions in Ukraine., Statements, LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States), recalling the current indispensable actions of humanitarian actors, said her delegation is outraged at Moscow’s continued attacks, which have turned half a million children into refugees, with a total of 1.7 million people fleeing the country and countless others displaced, facing death and injuries. At least 100 refugees are crossing into Poland every minute, she said, recalling recent discussions with delegations about, among other things, how the United States can help. From the reckless attack on Europe’s largest nuclear power plant to shelling those fleeing to safety, the Russian Federation’s actions have seen hospitals bombed and cities under siege. The United States is working with Ukraine, international organizations and partners to monitor the situation and assess needs. Pointing to the current $1.5 billion in pledged support, she said the needs will only increase if the Russian Federation continues its attacks., Urging parties to heed the call the humanitarian actors just sounded, she said the Russian Federation must commit to allow humanitarian access, calling on Moscow to agree to and honour timebound safe passage in agreed upon locations and a safe communication system to ensure that supplies can reach those most in need. Increasingly concerned about civilian protection, especially women, girls and other vulnerable groups affected by “Putin’s war”, she said the physical and psychological wounds will be long lasting. While it is evident that Mr. Putin has a plan, he does not seem to be listening, she said, emphasizing that Ukrainians are defending themselves bravely and pledging her delegation’s support for them. Indeed, Washington, D.C., has been warning Moscow for weeks that this war will make the Russian Federation weaker, not stronger. Supporting Ukraine’s call for a ceasefire, she called on the Russian Federation to de-escalate and cease hostilities. In the meantime, she said: “We must do everything to help Ukraine.”, FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said this war of choice is becoming a war of obsession, as civilians are killed, children traumatized and attacks trigger the fastest and largest refugee crisis since the Second World War. The huge humanitarian needs across Ukraine are multiplying by the hour, he said, applauding Poland, the Republic of Moldova and other nations for welcoming refugees. “Where are the commitments of a permanent member of this body? Does international humanitarian law have any meaning for Russia today?” he asked, adding: “The answers lie under the blood of innocent Ukrainians.” Noting that the Russian Federation’s aggression constitutes war crimes and atrocities, he said there will be accountability, expressing support for Ukraine’s application to the International Criminal Court. Meanwhile, he called for a ceasefire, the opening of safe humanitarian corridors and for the protection of civilians, without discrimination. Another nasty war simmers in the background, with misinformation abound and the Russian Federation’s new law that has seen media outlets shutting down. “Attacking freedom this way is the first sign of a dictatorship”, he said, recalling Albania’s history in this regard and emphasizing that Russians need to know the truth. Civilian protection must remain a top priority, he said, also raising concerns about the ongoing destruction of cultural heritage. Twelve days ago, Ukraine was guilty because it existed, and now it is guilty because it will not surrender, he said, adding that the world knows what is happening and everything must be done to stop the war., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said that he wished to highlight UNICEF’s non-biased reaction to the crisis in Ukraine over the last eight years and he hopes this approach will continue in the future. UNICEF’s views should be based on tried and trusted information. There is a mass proliferation of small arms and light weapons in Ukraine that have fallen into the hands of those recently released from prison, he said, noting that the number of civilian victims at the hands of radicals grows daily. He called on the Security Council to keep to the humanitarian context of what is happening in Ukraine, and not rely on Ukrainian politicians and mendacious social networks for their political views. There is a disinformation war going on in the West, where Russian Federation information resources are being turned off and not permitted to broadcast., The representative of the United States today accused Moscow of not complying with its commitments to create safe humanitarian corridors, he said. The Russian armed forces are not the ones bombarding civilians, but rather it is Ukrainian radicals and Neo-Nazis who are holding hostages in towns and cities and using civilians as human shields. Russian Federation units have declared a ceasefire, he said, noting that at Ukraine’s request, representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were invited and the Russian Federation was prepared to provide assistance. However, the radicals in Mariupol violated this agreement, as can be clearly heard in a radio conversation that was intercepted. The radicals were told to “shoot at the legs” of those heading for the humanitarian corridors., Considering the catastrophic humanitarian situation and also the personal request of France’s President Emmanuel Macron to President Putin, the Russian armed forces said there would be a ceasefire on 7 March at which point they would open humanitarian corridors towards Russian and Ukrainian territory. In their statements of the impossibility of evacuating Ukrainian citizens towards the Russian Federation, officials ignore the fact that there are already such citizens there and the Russian border has been crossed by 900 vehicles in the last 24 hours. Ukrainian radicals are continuing to hold over 1,500 foreigners hostage in a range of cities, he said, noting that Moscow is working around the clock on these issues. The deployment of heavy weaponry, including bombardment artillery, has become a rule for Ukrainian nationalist battalions., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) recounted the story of Andri, a two-month-old boy, who crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland over the weekend. As his aunt, Valentina, comforted him and his mother, she told the United Nations refugee agency: “I never thought I would have to leave my home. That I would have to flee just to save my life.” As a brutal war is waged, “little to no” regard is seen for the safety of civilians. Andri and Valentina represented only two of the over 1.5 million people who have become refugees in less than two weeks. Citing reports hourly of multiple attacks on medical facilities including maternity and children’s hospitals, even oncology clinics, she said: “We have looked on in horror as attempts to evacuate an estimated 200,000 people from Mariupol have failed.” The ICRC has been clear: whatever is agreed, or not agreed, on humanitarian corridors or other measures, civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected. “Each chilling violation of international law evokes the darkest days of Europe’s past,” she said. Women and girls are especially vulnerable to abuse, and they must be protected from rape and sexual violence, she said, adding: “We will work to ensure that there can be no place to hide from accountability for anyone who perpetrates crimes against them.” She appealed to all countries in the region to keep their borders open to all of those seeking safety and protection, urging the Russian Federation to immediately cease hostilities, unconditionally withdraw its forces from the entire territory of Ukraine and refrain from further threat or use of force of any kind against Ukraine or any other Member State., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) declared: “The world is watching in horror at the humanitarian crisis caused by President [Vladimir] Putin’s war on the Ukrainian people.” In response to Ukraine’s fierce resistance, Moscow is now directing a campaign of violence and cruelty against civilians. Citing reports of apartment blocks torn apart and attacks on civilian infrastructure — including by cluster munitions — she said people have been left without electricity, food, water and shelter. Describing the Russian Federation’s breaches of humanitarian ceasefires as an abomination, she noted the horrifying images of a family killed by Russian strikes in Irpin. “Let me be clear — we will hold Russia to account for its actions and will investigate thoroughly allegations of war crimes and violations of international law,” she said. The United Kingdom has committed over $285 million in aid to the crisis, but what the Ukrainian people really need is an end to the invasion. “We appeal to Russia to end their war before they bring even more tragedy to Ukraine and even more shame on their proud nation,” she said., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said urgent coordinated action is required to face the current enormous challenges. Calling for a sustained pause of hostilities, he said humanitarian assistance must not be held hostage by military attacks. Instead, resolution 2573 (2021) must be implemented alongside all relevant international laws. Highlighting four priority areas for action, he called for an immediate halt to the use of prohibited cluster munitions. In addition, all efforts must be made to monitor and protect children and other vulnerable groups. Equally important is establishing a safe humanitarian pause to allow those fleeing to reach safety and those delivering critical assistance to reach those in need, he said, emphasizing that attacks on refugees violate international humanitarian law. The fourth priority is the need to address these multidimensional challenges, including by providing psycho-social services. The Council must resume its role as the main body responsible for international peace and security, he said, expressing hope that the forthcoming consultations will bring delegations closer together towards a common goal: helping the people of Ukraine., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) said that what is happening is a true humanitarian tragedy stemming from the Russian Federation’s aggression, which has destroyed civilian infrastructure and placed cities under siege. “This is just the beginning,” he said, commending neighbouring States’ for their welcome to refugees fleeing the violence. For its part, France has pledged €100 million and already sent 100 tons of humanitarian aid to help Ukraine. The priority now is ending the violence and ensuring respect for international humanitarian law, he said, recalling recent talks between the leaders of France and the Russian Federation. Civilian protection is equally essential. Regarding safe passageways for those wishing to escape the fighting and aid workers who are trying to reach those in need, he said his counterpart from the Russian Federation has just raised the point of the implementation of humanitarian corridors. These corridors, however, lead towards the Russian Federation, he said, adding that he did not know of any Ukrainians who wanted to go there. As such, France and Mexico are working on a draft resolution related to international humanitarian law. It must be possible for those trying to flee Ukraine to do so. Humanitarian access must be guaranteed, for those leaving and those staying behind. Light must be shed on allegations of crimes, which should not go unpunished, he said, expressing support for the work of the International Criminal Court and the Human Rights Council., T. S. TIRUMURTI (India) said the worsening situation in Ukraine and the ensuing humanitarian crisis deserves the Council’s immediate and urgent attention. India has consistently called for an immediate end to all hostilities and reiterated its urgent demand for safe and uninterrupted passage for all innocent civilians, including Indian nationals in Ukraine. Noting that more than 20,000 Indians and people of other nationalities have been safely helped to leave the country, he added that his country has sent seven tranches of humanitarian supplies to Ukraine and neighbouring countries containing medicine, medical equipment, tents, water storage tanks, sleeping mats, blankets and other critical items. Against that backdrop, he emphasized that humanitarian action must always be guided by the principles of humanitarian assistance, namely humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. “These should not be politicized,” he stressed., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) said his delegation Gabon maintains its solidarity with the people that are suffering and invites the parties to create safe, unrestricted paths out of Ukrainian territory. He called for rapid, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need, to protect civilians, including humanitarian personnel and people in vulnerable situations, in particular women, the elderly, people with disabilities and children. He commended the international community’s mobilization of funds, noting that the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) had activated their funding mechanisms during the first days of the war, preparing to mobilize $3 billion dollars, including $550 million in the very short term to support Ukraine. He applauded the generosity of countries bordering Ukraine that have welcomed those who have fled, he said, cautioning that such receptions should be afforded for all, including those from Africa., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) urged all parties to establish a cease-fire and engage in negotiations and to fully respect international humanitarian law, including when resorting to new military technologies and cyber-means. He also urged the parties to continue to establish humanitarian pauses and to create humanitarian corridors. Echoing ICRC’s concerns about upholding international humanitarian law rules for those choosing to leave and those choosing to remain, he stressed: “The rules of war are not optional.” He also joined the call for Ukraine’s neighbours to keep their borders open to refugees, without any kind of discrimination. Children in Ukraine must be protected and under no circumstances should be recruited, used or allowed to join any military activity or take any direct part in hostilities. Attacks against civilian infrastructure, especially schools and medical facilities, as well as water and sanitation systems, must be avoided and no additional hardship should be imposed on the affected populations and vulnerable groups through broad economic sanctions. Citing the need to support a growing number of internally displaced children in Ukraine and refugee children in neighbouring countries, he said Brazil has established a humanitarian visa policy for those fleeing the conflict. Brazilian embassies in Bratislava, Bucharest, Budapest, Prague and Warsaw have started to grant special visas for displaced Ukrainians and stateless persons for humanitarian reception purposes., MICHAEL KAPKIAI KIBOINO (Kenya), stressing that safety guarantees must be given to civilians, including foreign nationals, urged Ukraine’s neighbours who are hosting refugees to ensure that the civilian protections sought are offered with no discrimination on any basis, including race or religion. Disturbed by reports of broad damage to civilian infrastructure, he drew attention to calls against this provided in resolution 2573 (2021). The impact of the conflict will trigger a shock to the global food supply, given that Ukraine is a major producer, and the world will also suffer greatly from the unilateral and regional sanctions against the Russian Federation, he said, stressing that humanitarian and legal consideration must be given to their frightful impact on the Russian people. That concern extends to many nations, including Kenya. While the sanctions are aimed at pressuring the Russian Federation for its inexcusable breach of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, they will end up harming innocent Russians and the Global South. Directing questions to Mr. Griffiths, he asked if the Under-Secretary-General can make public his assessments of the impact of the conflict in Ukraine and the sanctions against the Russian Federation on the humanitarian situation in other countries, particularly regarding food security. He also asked what preventive actions the United Nations and Security Council can take to ensure that the shock to the global food supply system does not translate into new crises. The only way out of the crisis is for a ceasefire and dialogue to protect Ukrainian sovereignty and shape a stable European security order., CAROLYN ABENA ANIMA OPPONG-NTIRI (Ghana) expressed regret that the agreement reached between the two sides for the creation of humanitarian corridors for safe evacuations and the unhindered passage of food and medicines did not hold. She joined other Council members in reiterating the call for a humanitarian pause to allow the evacuation of civilians, especially in the cities of Mariupol and Kharkiv, where intense military operations are ongoing. She called for the immediate cessation of hostilities in residential and civilian populated areas. It is also vital to reach agreements to allow “windows of silence” that would enable the safe and unhindered passage of humanitarian convoys to all areas where civilians remain in need of water, food and medical care. Ghana further supports the United Nations request for the urgent establishment of a notification system and an emergency hotline with both Governments of the Russian Federation and Ukraine to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and life-saving supplies., MONA JUUL (Norway) echoed expressions of grave concern over the staggering numbers of civilian casualties in Ukraine — which include children — and declared: “Russia, and Russia alone, bears the sole responsibility for this humanitarian crisis.” Demanding an urgent end to the aggression, she voiced concern over reports of the use of cluster munitions by Russian forces, which are inherently indiscriminate weapons, and about the fate of unaccompanied children separated from their families. Every effort must be made to restore family links and trace missing persons, she stressed, calling on humanitarian organizations to prioritize assistance to and protection of children affected by the conflict, including their need for mental health and psychosocial support. Meanwhile, Moscow’s use of urban warfare and attacks on schools and around nuclear plants endangers the health of today’s children and that of future generations. Norway supports the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs’ call for concrete steps to ensure the protection of civilians and humanitarian access and stresses that evacuations must be safe, voluntary and to destinations of people’s own choosing, she said., ZHANG JUN (China) expressed his concern over the rapidly changing situation in Ukraine and deplored the increasing number of civilian casualties. He called for an intensification of diplomatic efforts to ensure an early end to the fighting and to prevent the emergence of a large-scale humanitarian crisis. The Russian Federation and Ukraine should overcome their difficulties in the implementation of humanitarian corridors to ensure that they are safe. The humanitarian operations must abide by the principle of impartiality in order to prevent the politicization of humanitarian issues. Full attention should be paid to those displaced as well as the protection of civilians, especially women, children, the elderly and people with disabilities. The safety of foreign nations must be ensured, as well as their guaranteed and unrestricted departure from Ukraine. The United Nations coordinating role in humanitarian assistance should be supported. What is required is calm and reason, rather than adding fuel to the fire, he underscored. It is essential to abide by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, to respect the sovereignty of countries and address the reasonable security concerns of the parties, he said, adding that it is imperative to stick to dialogue and find a resolution to the crisis through peaceful means., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates), Council President for March, spoke in her national capacity, agreeing that the humanitarian situation in Ukraine has reached catastrophic levels. “Considering these grim facts, we must, as an international community, try to urgently alleviate the humanitarian suffering of Ukrainians,” she said. She called on all parties to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law, including ensuring that civilians and civilian objects such as schools and hospitals are not the target of attacks. Humanitarian aid must reach those in need without precondition on any ceasefire agreements, and the safety of humanitarian personnel must be ensured. Stressing the need to stop hostilities to allow affected civilians to leave cities exposed to violence — including Mariupol, Kharkiv and Sumy — she voiced deep regret over the collapse of agreed humanitarian corridors, which can serve an important role despite being imperfect solutions. She also called on donors to contribute to the humanitarian flash appeal and the Ukraine Regional Refugee Response Plan, noting that her country will send $5 million along with emergency medical and relief aid., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said that 12 days of an all-out Russian invasion in Ukraine, including from the territory of Belarus, have brought it to the brink of humanitarian catastrophe. More than 1.7 million people, mostly women and children, have already fled. The Russian Federation continues to cynically disregard the norms of international humanitarian law. Its troops are blocking the Ukrainian authorities’ numerous attempts to evacuate civilians through humanitarian corridors as well as international organizations’ access to provide humanitarian assistance to the most affected places. In violation of the previously reached agreements, Russian troops are opening fire on evacuees and evacuation vehicles and shelling the roads allocated for humanitarian corridors, disrupting evacuations from the besieged cities of the suburbs of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk and Kherson regions. The Russian armed forces continue bombing and missile attacks on Kyiv, Mariupol, Volnovakha, Sumy, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and other cities, towns and villages, preventing the safe exit of humanitarian convoys carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens, as well as the delivery of medications and food., Noting that the hearings for Ukraine’s lawsuit against the Russian Federation have commenced at the International Court of Justice, he appealed to the Court to impose precautionary measures in order to stop the bloodshed. Moscow must stop violating the ceasefire arrangements aimed at ensuring rapid, safe and unhindered passage through humanitarian corridors. He decried attempts by the Russian Federation to force civilians in the besieged cities to flee to its territory and that of Belarus, taking into account the high probability of provocations such as taking those evacuated as hostages. “It looks especially cynical when European borders are widely open for refugees from Ukraine,” he said. During the course of the meeting today, there has been another appalling example of Moscow’s disregard for humanitarian corridors. Despite a route being agreed upon by the parties and with the ICRC, Moscow has already sent a letter showing routes to the Russian Federation and Belarus only. He reiterated his call for the previously agreed routes that would allow people to leave for Europe., Ukraine has been one of the guarantors of global food security, he said, noting that the implications at the global level of the war unleashed on his country will be catastrophic. Some 55 per cent of sunflower oil exported worldwide comes from Ukraine, while 60 per cent of Ukrainian agricultural products are exported through seaports. The closure of ports and the sea by the Russian army threatens the global supply chain, he said, stressing that defending Ukraine from the Russian aggression also protects the world from hunger. More than 211 Ukrainian schools have been damaged or destroyed by the Russian military forces since the beginning of the invasion. “The Russian occupiers are killing Ukrainian children,” he said, and doing so both “consciously and cynically”. At least 38 children have been already killed since the full-scale armed aggression began., People in Ukraine require concrete actions to save their lives, their health and their property, he said. It is evident that the fragility of the situation reaches beyond Ukraine, into Europe and across the world. “We expect the Council to be decisive in responding to the worst humanitarian crisis we have ever seen since the end of the Second World War in Europe,” he said. After the last Council session, a colleague said that it was like group therapy, with everyone trying to bring one member to sanity. Listening to this member, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene should be called. It is very difficult to listen to the persistent “lies and delusion and delirium” coming from that country. He went on to refer to a Tweet quoting Sergey Lavrov saying that “the goal of Russia’s special military operation is to stop any war that could take place on Ukrainian territory or that could start from there.” This was tweeted by the Russian Embassy in London and retweeted by the Russian Foreign Ministry. In London you can dial 111 for mental health services, he said., Mr. NEBENZIA, taking the floor a second time, said the Ukrainian representative has interpreted the letter “Z”, but “we have our own opinion on who the animals are”, pointing to those terrorizing the people of Luhansk and other areas. In fact, everything is the contrary of what his counterpart from Ukraine had said, he stated, noting that the Ukrainians will not agree to a ceasefire, with battalions holding civilians hostage. Indeed, a post on [the social media platform] Telegram about a related issue showed that national Azov battalions were bombarding civilians. Pointing to a report on a coordination committee for humanitarian affairs in Ukraine, he said his delegation would broadcast its contents among Security Council members. Humanitarian corridors from Mariupol and other cities will be open, he said, adding: “Let us see what answer we get from the Ukrainians.” Emphasizing that there are no demands about citizens being sent to the Russian Federation, he said, ultimately, it would be the choice of people on where they wanted to be evacuated to. He also wondered how his Ukrainian counterpart is so familiar with mental health services in the Russian Federation., For information media.

"Ukraine crisis increases risk of trafficking, exploitation and maternal deaths, CARE warns",News and Press Release,CARE,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",8 Mar 2022,"As the world marks International Women’s Day, the aid organisation CARE is warning the war in Ukraine comes with specific and concerning risks for women and girls., With men aged between 18 and 60 required to stay and fight, the majority of the more than 1.5 million refugees currently fleeing the conflict are women and children., CARE’s Emergency Media Manager, Ninja Taprogge, says that at the border crossings and in reception centres, exploitation, abuse and trafficking is a real concern., “While we applaud the goodwill of host communities and volunteers, getting in a stranger’s car or staying in a house with someone unknown creates obvious risks, especially for women and young girls travelling on their own,” says Ms Taprogge, who is currently at the border of Poland and Ukraine., “For women who have been forced to flee their homes, who are far away from their usual support networks and usual means of income; exploitation — including sexual exploitation — is a real risk.”, There is a dire need for coordinated protection services to register and accompany those fleeing the conflict, arriving exhausted and disoriented., In any such crisis situation, refugees are less at risk when they have choices and options. This means ensuring they have adequate legal protection, the correct papers, and are fully aware of their rights., “We also need to provide cash, shelter, food and ongoing income support to vulnerable people so they’re not at risk of exploitation,” Ms Taprogge says., Ms Taprogge also stresses the need for sexual, reproductive and maternal health services as part of the humanitarian response., “Breastfeeding mothers and pregnant women have been waiting up to two days in the freezing cold to cross the border. Imagine you’re on the road with an infant, with nowhere to feed and change them out of the cold. Or imagine you’re pregnant and have chosen to stay, but your local hospital has closed due to the risk of shelling. Where are you going to deliver
your baby?”, According to the World Health Organisation, an estimated 60% of preventable maternal deaths in the world take place in fragile settings where political conflict, displacement and natural disasters prevail., CARE asks donors to ensure there are sexual, reproductive and maternal health services inside Ukraine and along refugee routes to meet the demand, as well as services to prevent and respond to violence against women., CARE is supporting its local partner organisations to provide warm, safe spaces for refugees to rest at border crossings, and send durable food, sleeping bags, diapers and other essentials into Ukraine., “One of the best ways to ensure the specific needs and vulnerabilities of women are addressed is to fund women’s organisations in Ukraine, and other local organisations led by and serving specific groups, such as people with disabilities. These groups also need to be consulted as the international humanitarian response is planned, because their local knowledge, skills and networks are invaluable,” Ms Taprogge says., CARE is also recommending neighbouring countries collect statistics on the gender, age and disability status of refugees so that humanitarian responses can accurately understand refugee demographics in order to effectively meet their needs., For more information, see CARE’s Rapid Gender Analysis on Ukraine, March 2022, Donate to CARE Australia’s Ukraine crisis appeal, For media enquiries, contact Iona Salter on 0413 185 634",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-increases-risk-trafficking-exploitation-and-maternal-deaths-care-warns
Briefing to the UN Security Council on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine by UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell,News and Press Release,UNICEF,Protection and Human Rights,7 Mar 2022,"Excellencies and colleagues,, I would like to express my appreciation to Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield and Ambassador Ferit Hoxha for convening today’s meeting. I would also like to thank Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh and the United Arab Emirates for hosting this briefing during your Security Council presidency., This is my first time briefing the Security Council as UNICEF Executive Director. I regret that it has been made necessary by the rapidly worsening situation in Ukraine -- and the unconscionable impact the conflict is having on Ukraine’s children., The past eight years of conflict in Ukraine have already inflicted profound and lasting harm to children., With the escalation of the conflict, the immediate and very real threat to Ukraine’s 7.5 million children has grown. Homes, schools, orphanages, and hospitals have all come under attack. Civilian infrastructure like water and sanitation facilities have been hit, leaving millions without access to safe water., For many, life has moved underground as families seek safety in shelters, subways, or basements, often for hours on end. Women are giving birth in makeshift maternity wards with limited medical supplies., Most stores are closed, making it hard for people to buy essential items, including basic necessities for children like diapers and medication. And even if stores were open, millions of people are too afraid to venture outside for food or water because of continuous shelling and shooting., The intensification of the armed conflict is posing severe human costs, which are increasing exponentially by the day., As of today, OHCHR recorded 1207 civilian casualties in Ukraine. Since February 24, at least 27 children have been killed and 42 children have been wounded. Countless more have been severely traumatized., As the fighting has now reached densely populated areas and across the country, we expect child casualties to increase., We also expect the displacement crisis to continue growing rapidly., As of yesterday, UNHCR was reporting an excess of 1.7 million refugees fleeing to hosting countries. Half of the people on the move are children. UNICEF is working closely with UNHCR to reach them with protection and assistance in receiving countries., I have just returned from the Romania-Ukraine border, where thousands of women and children have come to escape the fighting. I met with mothers and children who had to flee their homes at a moment’s notice., They told me how it felt to leave everything you know behind. To leave husbands, fathers, and elderly loved ones, not knowing when or whether they would see each other again., The children talked about being suddenly pulled out of school, losing beloved toys, and the terrifying sound of shelling and gunfire. So many children have been deeply traumatized., Excellencies,, UNICEF and our partners are working 24 hours a day to meet rapidly escalating humanitarian needs in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries -- from trucking in safe water for drinking and hygiene, providing emergency medical services, and providing shelter and protection for those displaced from their homes., At present, we have some 135 people working for UNICEF in Ukraine, and we are sending more to meet needs in-country. UNICEF-supported child protection mobile teams are reaching children wherever they can with psychosocial care, mental health support, and protection services., The operating environment in Ukraine is extremely complex. Access constraints and rapidly changing front lines make it much more difficult to deliver critical supplies and services. The safety and well-being of our staff on the ground remains a top priority., I also want to spotlight our local partners and other local humanitarian actors, who continue to operate under extremely difficult security conditions, especially those working in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, regions that have been hard-hit over the past several weeks., I am very glad to tell you that on Sunday, UNICEF delivered 40 tons of medical life-saving items for children and mothers to in 22 hospitals from five of the most affected regions., This equipment included midwifery and obstetrics kits, resuscitation and surgical kits, oxygen concentrators for shelters’ hospitals, and first aid kits for frontline health workers – enough to meet the needs of 20,000 children and their mothers. In coordination with the Ministry of Health, UNICEF is assessing further needs and preparing other shipments., UNICEF and our partners need flexible resources and safe, uninterrupted access to rapidly scale up our efforts to meet children’s urgent needs, wherever they are– whether still in Ukraine or on the move, In collaboration with UNHCR, we have deployed teams to Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Republic of Slovakia, and built on our ongoing presence in Romania, Moldova, and Belarus to support the urgent needs of children., We have begun operating ‘Blue Dot’ safe spaces in hosting countries at border crossings where children are first registered. The hubs provide a one-stop safe space for children and their families. They offer a range of services, including places for children to play, psychosocial support, basic legal counselling, recreational kits, and hygiene products. I visited one of these last week., Staff at hubs are also able to identify unaccompanied and separated children. Children without parental care are at a heightened risk of violence, abuse, and exploitation. When these children are moved across borders, the risks are multiplied. The risk of trafficking also soars in emergencies., UNICEF and UNHCR have urged all hosting countries to take measures to identify and register unaccompanied and separated children fleeing Ukraine, after allowing them access to their territory., Temporary foster care and other community-based care provided through a government system can help protect children who have been displaced without their families. But we want to stress that adoption should never occur during or immediately after emergencies. Every effort should be made to reunify children with their families., Inside Ukraine, UNICEF is also deeply concerned about the safety and wellbeing of the nearly 100,000 children, half of them with disabilities, who live in institutions and boarding schools. We have received reports of institutions understandably seeking to move children to safety in neighbouring countries and beyond., Many of these children have living relatives or legal guardians. All of these children have the right to be protected., While we recognize that humanitarian evacuations may become necessary to save lives, special measures must be taken to contact relatives and obtain consent to move these children to safety -- and to reunify them with their families when the threat is passed., With the spread of the conflict, we should all be extremely concerned about the risks posed to children by landmines and explosive remnants of war. Even prior to the recent escalation, Eastern Ukraine was one of the most mine-contaminated stretches of land in the world. This brutal reality is rapidly extending to other parts of the country., We will continue doing everything we can for children in Ukraine. We are committed to stay and deliver. But we need your support., Excellencies,, What is happening to children in Ukraine is a moral outrage. Images of a mother and her two children and a friend lying dead on the street – hit by a mortar as they tried to flee to safety – must shock the conscience of the world. We must act to protect children from this brutality., UNICEF calls upon the members of this Council to remind all parties of their legal and moral obligation to protect children and spare them from attack., We remain extremely concerned about attacks on the civilian infrastructure necessary to help children weather this conflict, including schools, hospitals, water and sanitation facilities, and critical energy infrastructure., We call on all parties to refrain from fighting near or targeting these protected areas, and from cyber-attacks that can disrupt critical services for children and families., We appeal to all parties to avoid the use of explosive weapons in populated areas, including cluster munitions, which pose the gravest risk of harm to children. And we urge all parties to protect civilians from further harm related to contamination from landmines and explosive remnants of war., UNICEF respectfully asks this Council to send a strong message to all parties of their obligation to ensure the safety of humanitarian personnel and equipment, and to permit and facilitate our work., This also means ensuring that sanctions and other restrictive measures do not impede humanitarian action., Finally, we have renewed our call for an immediate suspension of ongoing military actions in Ukraine. We need a ceasefire and adequate guarantees to enable safe and rapid humanitarian access to all people in need across Ukraine., This will allow critical humanitarian assistance and protection to reach those in need -- and to let families in the most affected areas venture out to get food and water, seek medical care, or leave their homes to find safety., In closing, I would like to emphasize that UNICEF is humanitarian actor abiding by humanitarian principles. Over the past 8 years UNICEF has been working on both sides of the line of contact in Eastern Ukraine and we are committed to providing humanitarian assistance and protection to all childrenin need across Ukraine and in neighbouring countries., But this brutality must come to an end., Excellencies, colleagues,, Children in Ukraine need help and protection., They need supplies and other critical support., They need access to basic social services like health and education., They need hope for the future., But above all children in Ukraine need peace. It is the only sustainable solution., Thank you for this opportunity to speak to you today.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/briefing-un-security-council-humanitarian-situation-ukraine-unicef-executive-director
Donors making a difference: In Ukraine emergency,News and Press Release,WHO,"Contributions
Health",8 Mar 2022,"WHO has issued an appeal for funding to support Ukraine's health services and care for the country's refugees. To learn more, or to donate, visit the WHO Foundation., Supported by donors, WHO takes prompt action to bolster health services in Ukraine, WHO has sent large shipments of medical supplies to Ukraine and released US$ 5.2 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to respond to the country's urgent health needs., WHO shipments have arrived in Poland bearing 76 metric tonnes of emergency health supplies bound for Ukraine. The shipments included supplies for surgery, trauma and health care, along with freezers, refrigerators, ice packs and cool boxes., ""WHO is on the ground, working with our partners to respond, to assess the impact of the conflict on the health of Ukraine's people and its health system and to deliver essential medical supplies from our hub in Dubai,"" WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week as the crisis unfolded., WHO is also exploring solutions to maintain the country's supply of medical oxygen and other life-saving treatments, amid disrupted supply lines., The money in WHO's Contingency Fund for Emergencies comes from 24 donor countries whose pooled contributions allow WHO to respond quickly to disease outbreaks and emergencies -- often within the first 24 hours, a critical time in a crisis. Created in 2015, the Fund is one of WHO's most powerful tools for responding in acute health emergencies., Emergency appeal seeks funds for health services in Ukraine, The WHO Foundation has put in place a mechanism anyone can use to donate money to support a range of vital health services for people in Ukraine and for those who have fled the crisis into neighbouring countries., ""Migrants, older people and refugees are in a particularly vulnerable situation,"" the Foundation notes in its appeal. ""Support will help expand the capacity of emergency medical teams to respond to the growing needs of the population in this evolving humanitarian health crisis."", WHO estimates that it will need US$ 45 million to support Ukraine and US$ 12.5 million to support neighbouring countries as they care for refugees., Ukraine is facing a shortfall in medicines and supplies, including medical oxygen and intensive care unit beds, and needs urgent support for its health workforce., WHO has published an appeal outlining the health needs and related costs arising from the crisis, noting that casualties have been reported across the country and are expected to rise., ""Emergency Medical Services, surgical departments and intensive care units are likely to become overwhelmed with trauma patients,"" the appeal says. ""Essential health services have been disrupted and are collapsing and jeopardize the treatment of chronic/non-communicable diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases."", Medical oxygen supplies are dangerously low in Ukraine, WHO leaders warn, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (WHO Director General) and Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge (Director of the WHO Regional European Office) have called for critical medical supplies to safely reach those who need them and are working with partners to establish safe transit for shipments through Poland., ""The oxygen supply situation is nearing a very dangerous point in Ukraine,"" the two leaders said in a joint statement on 27 February. ""Trucks are unable to transport oxygen supplies from plants to hospitals across the country, including the capital Kyiv. The majority of hospitals could exhaust their oxygen reserves within the next 24 hours. Some have already run out. This puts thousands of lives at risk."", The joint statement notes that medical oxygen is crucial for patients with COVID-19, injuries, trauma, sepsis, complications of childbirth and numerous other conditions., Running a hospital while your country is under attack: a story from western Ukraine, WHO staff reports from Novovolynsk Hospital, where patients are crowding into underground bunkers to shelter from the military offensive. Similar scenarios are playing out across Ukraine., “In one day the air-raid sirens went off five separate times. Our patients are mostly the elderly.

As delivered, Madam President,, We are here, of course, to speak about the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. And yet, none of us want to be here today., We already had enough on our hands, many other unnecessary and unwanted conflicts leaving misery in their wake., We had no need for another war, which would have such a swift and sweeping impact for what Filippo Grandi has called the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War., Today, indeed, is not a day we had in mind., In the weeks before the military offensive began in Ukraine, and despite the din of commentary and rhetoric and prediction, humanitarian organizations went about their business., They have been working in the Donbas region providing 1.5 million people there with humanitarian aid. A business they have been doing quietly and without fanfare these past eight years., And they are doing it still today, however and whenever they can., But, of course, they – the humanitarian agencies – also prepared for worse to come., Two weeks ago, few thought the scenario in which we find ourselves today – one of such intense conflict – was thinkable. It was essentially unplannable from the humanitarian operational perspective.And yet that humanitarian community did plan., We looked to the possible numbers, with UNHCR and IOM and our NGO partners, and UNICEF and WFP. We estimated together who might be in need, who might be on the move, or those vulnerable people who might need help at home., We looked at possible routes and methods of delivery. The World Food Programme mobilized its considerable logistics to get supply chains up and running, from a standing start., We knew that this operation would need the best of talent. And all humanitarian agencies, and including my office, sent in surge staff in the days before that offensive began., And as the unthinkable became the reality, the UN and its humanitarian partners started a scalable and agile, adaptable and resilient humanitarian operation fit for the changing situation. They started it., The Secretary-General, at record speed, appointed Amin Awad, a person of the widest experience of fast-moving operations, including in that very region, as his Crisis Coordinator., Amin, supported by Osnat Lubrani, the experienced Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, is in Ukraine as we meet here today., In the first days of the offensive, our staff, like so many in Ukraine, spent their days and nights working from bunkers and basements., Yet they managed to produce the two robust response plans, launched last week in Geneva, to a very generous donor response., Madam President,, Do I need to describe what we have all seen and heard on the news? Simply put, millions of lives shattered., People can’t stay home with shops shut, power and water cut, shells falling, phones switched off. They can’t find what they need, even if they have money to pay for it. And as we have seen, even as the TV cameras roll, many can’t flee in safety either in this conflict. It’s been 11 days of escalating violence, fear and pain. As of 6 March, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights reported at least 1,207 civilian casualties, including at least 406 dead. And I guess the real figure could be considerably higher., UNHCR reports that more than 1.7 million refugees have fled – and that figure is probably out of date already – in 11 days., Madam President,, Humanitarian assistance has continued in areas where security permits. Under the leadership of the Crisis Coordinator and the Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in country, we have new plans now, of course, on how to deliver where humanitarian needs are most acute. This includes the cities that we have seen so much on these last days, such as Mariupol, Kharkiv, Kherson. Our response is being scaled up from hubs in Vinnutsya, Uzhorod and Lviv., The UN and our partners, and we will hear I’m sure from Cathy in a minute, have already provided food to hundreds of thousands. The World Food Programme is setting up supply chain operations to deliver immediate food and cash assistance to 3-5 million people inside Ukraine., WHO has shipped trauma care, emergency surgery equipment and other supplies that will help, that will help, in days to come, thousands of people. And more supplies are on their way., UNHCR is providing assistance, albeit at a small scale at the moment, through a network of shops in Mariupol, in collaboration with NGOs. MSF never left. It’s training trauma surgeons, providing support for the people in that city., UNHCR is bringing in thousands of blankets, mattresses and other non-food items from Poland – thank you to Poland – and shipping them to transit centres., And we’re going to hear, and I look forward to hearing a lot more about the experience of children from Cathy, from the vital work of UNICEF and its partners., The Ukrainian Red Cross has distributed humanitarian assistance to thousands via its emergency stockpiles, including hygiene and food kits, warm clothing and medicine., And I would like to take the chance here to salute the more than 4,000 Ukraine Red Cross volunteers across the country used to conflict, of course, the community workers also of local NGOs, the truck drivers carrying basic necessities into volatile areas. These are people all in harm’s way, who have no hesitation in carrying out their mission., Madam President,, I see three immediate priorities to lessen the pain and suffering we are all watching unfold in real time:
First, the parties need to take constant care to spare civilians and civilian homes and infrastructure in their military operations. This includes allowing safe passage for civilians to leave areas of active hostilities on a voluntary basis, in the direction they choose. All civilians, whether they stay or leave, must be respected and protected., Second, we need safe passage for humanitarian supplies into areas of active hostilities., Civilians in places like Mariupol, Kharkiv, Melitopol and elsewhere desperately need aid, especially life-saving medical supplies, the kind that are being brought in in these past days by WHO. Many modalities are possible, but it must take place in line with the parties’ obligations under the laws of war., And thirdly, we urgently need a system of constant communication with the parties to the conflict and assurances to enable the delivery of humanitarian aid. And we have seen these systems in place in other countries, of course, as you know well. A humanitarian notification system, as we term it, can support delivery of aid at the scale needed., I have already conveyed these three points to the authorities of Ukraine and to the Russian Federation.
And on the third point, thanks to the cooperation with the Russian Federation, my office has sent a team to Moscow to work on better humanitarian civil-military coordination that can allow us to scale up precisely to begin to establish a humanitarian notification system., This follows last Friday’s phone call between the Secretary-General and the Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation, Sergei Shoigu. UN teams have held the first technical meeting with the representatives of the Ministry of Defence., I welcome cooperation by both sides and sincerely hope to see further progress in the hours ahead.
Madam President, People are watching as this unnecessary conflict engulfs cities and civilians. As well as what’s happening in Ukraine, they have an extra sense of dread over the impact this will have on the wider world. I include myself in this category., I am deeply worried about the consequences on vulnerable people living half a world away., Food prices are spiking, supplies are uncertain. We didn’t need that either. People in the Sahel, in Yemen, the Horn of Africa, Afghanistan, Madagascar already face profound food insecurity., Record-level fuel prices mean life becomes harder still in places like Lebanon, where generators keep hospitals open and water treatment plants working., And the extraordinary generosity, which I welcome and praise, of donors to the launch of the Regional Plan and the Ukraine Humanitarian Response Plan. We hope that this will not divert those donors from other pressing humanitarian crises. This may be the latest one, but not the only one., So while we have planned, we have mobilized, we have fundraised to meet the challenge we face, we have the capacity and, I think, the know-how to meet the most urgent needs in Ukraine, on the basis of cooperation with the parties., But – and here I would like to stress this particular last point – make no mistake: we are unable to meet the needs of civilians today. All those points that I have made are points in preparation, in supply, in redeployment, in getting to the right place. But we’re failing to meet the needs of civilians today, at this time., I hope we will not fail them tomorrow., Thank you, Madam President.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-coordinator-1

Russia’s Indiscriminate Attacks Causing Civilian Deaths in Ukraine Must End,News and Press Release,CIVIC,Protection and Human Rights,7 Mar 2022,"The Hague, March 7, 2022 – Statement by Federico Borello, Executive Director of Center for Civilians in Conflict:, “We condemn all attacks that have resulted in the loss of civilian life as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Recent attacks documented by journalists and human rights experts indicate that Russian Armed Forces have launched indiscriminate attacks resulting in significant civilian casualties. Evidence suggests that civilians and civilian infrastructure may have been intentionally targeted in some cases. Shelling and fighting resulting in civilian casualties appear to have increased, suggesting a possible shift in armed tactics used by Russian Armed Forces aimed at causing significant civilian casualties to coerce the enemy to surrender., Recent images showing civilians coming under fire as they attempt to escape the city of Irpin are heartbreaking and illustrate the tragic truth of war: civilians bear the brunt of conflict. Besides, attacking civilians as they escape fighting could amount to a violation of international humanitarian law., While the civilian death toll varies depending on sources, there is little doubt that the number of civilian casualties is high and will keep rising as urban and populated areas continue to be under shelling and fighting., A full, transparent, impartial, and independent investigation into the killing of civilians must be urgently carried out by the Independent Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine established last week by the UN Human Rights Council., Civilians play no part in the conflict and must be allowed to flee safely. We urge warring actors to respect the terms of a ceasefire in Mariupol and wherever else agreed to allow safe passage for people fleeing the fighting. Humanitarian organizations working to facilitate evacuations of civilians and delivering lifesaving aid must be supported in their efforts and must be able to do so without coming under fire.”, For more information, please contact:, In The Hague: Hajer Naili, Director of Communications: hnaili@civiliansinconflict.org, +33 6 03 50 53 / +1.917.889.5982 (WhatsApp), In Washington, D.C.: CIVIC’s Global Media team: comms@civiliansinconflict.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/russia-s-indiscriminate-attacks-causing-civilian-deaths-ukraine-must-end

Unaccompanied and separated children fleeing escalating conflict in Ukraine must be protected,News and Press Release,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,7 Mar 2022,"Joint statement by UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, 07 March 2022, NEW YORK/GENEVA – In the past week, more than one million refugees have been forced to flee Ukraine seeking safety and protection. Hundreds of thousands of them are children. Amongst those fleeing, many are unaccompanied or have been separated from their parents or family members., Children without parental care are at a heightened risk of violence, abuse and exploitation. When these children are moved across borders, the risks are multiplied. The risk of trafficking also soars in emergencies., UNICEF and UNHCR urge all neighbouring and impacted countries to ensure the immediate identification and registration of unaccompanied and separated children fleeing from Ukraine, after allowing them access to their territory., States should offer safe spaces for children and families immediately following border crossings, and link these to national child protection systems. The current emergency also necessitates rapidly expanding the capacity of emergency care arrangements with screened caregivers as well as other critical services for the protection of children, including against gender-based violence, as well as family tracing and reunification mechanisms., For children who have been displaced across borders without their families, temporary foster or other community-based care through a government system offers critical protection. Adoption should not occur during or immediately after emergencies. Every effort should be made to reunify children with their families when possible, if such reunification is in their best interest., Nearly 100,000 children, half of them with disabilities, live in institutional care and boarding schools in Ukraine. Many of these children have living relatives or legal guardians. We have received reports of institutions seeking to move children to safety in neighbouring countries or beyond. While recognizing that, under specific circumstances, humanitarian evacuations can be lifesaving and welcoming efforts to bring children to safety, it is critical that special measures be taken in the best interest of the children, and that the consent of their parents or persons responsible for their care be granted. Under no circumstances should families be separated as a result of relocation or evacuation movements. Those legally responsible for children in institutions in Ukraine must ensure that evacuations are done in line with national authorities’ instructions. Movements must be reported to competent authorities in Ukraine and neighboring countries immediately upon crossing the border, and as far as possible, children should be evacuated with their identification papers and case files., UNHCR and UNICEF are grateful for the solidarity and readiness shown by States to support unaccompanied and separated children through eventual relocation schemes. At the same time, it must be recalled that unaccompanied and separated children are particularly vulnerable and their immediate needs and safety where they are must be prioritized in the short term, while medium to long term solutions are identified, based on their best interests., UNHCR and UNICEF are committed to working hand-in-hand to support national authorities to protect children, ensuring that their safety and protection are at the centre of the response., About UNICEF, UNICEF works in some of the world’s toughest places, to reach the world’s most disadvantaged children.

Recovery and Reconstruction",7 Mar 2022,"Supporting crisis-affected vulnerable smallholder men and women farmers, FAO requires USD 50 million over the next three months to urgently assist up to 240 000 of the most vulnerable rural men and women (over 100 000 households), including internally displaced people (IDPs) affected by the crisis. The response plan sets out key emergency agricultural interventions and immediate cash transfers to help sustain lives and agricultural livelihoods amid the escalating nationwide crisis. Depending on the local conditions, vulnerable households may receive cash, agricultural inputs or cash plus agricultural inputs., Overview, The recent escalation in conflict in Ukraine is affecting the food security of the most vulnerable rural households. According to the United Nations (UN) Flash Appeal, given the scale and direction of the ongoing hostilities, 18 million people are projected to be affected, including up to 6.7 million projected to be newly internally displaced. For rural and isolated communities, the conflict is resulting in large-scale displacement, compounding existing vulnerabilities and disrupting the agricultural livelihoods of smallholder farmers., In addition to Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (regions), which have long been affected by conflict, the crisis is predicted to impact the rural population in all regions of Ukraine. FAO will adapt its targeting of assistance based on the evolving situation, analysis of pre-existing vulnerability and the results of a rapid needs assessments. Large portions of the affected population will likely remain in their communities, facing extreme challenges and requiring multi-sectoral humanitarian assistance., With immediate assistance, FAO can support smallholder farmers throughout the country who choose to stay, including IDPs and host families, to plant their fields, save their livestock and produce food. Through the Rapid Response Plan, FAO will immediately inject multi-purpose cash assistance to address urgent needs, and, where needed and possible, combined with agriculture-based livelihood in-kind support to produce nutritious food., This Rapid Response Plan will focus exclusively on agricultural livelihood‐saving interventions for the most vulnerable smallholder farming households.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/fao-ukraine-rapid-response-plan-march-may-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",7 Mar 2022,"Russia’s military aggression against Ukraine has dramatically intensified the humanitarian crisis that has been underway since 2014 as a result of the illegal annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. While the state of emergency was previously concentrated along the “line of contact” and the adjacent areas of the Donbas region, it now practically encompasses the entire country due to the current hostilities and massive internal refugee movements., Consequently, over the weekend the Austrian government put together a second comprehensive aid package. The Foreign Ministry’s Foreign Disaster Fund (AKF) will provide an additional 15 million euros in humanitarian aid for the Ukrainian population., The most important thing now is to help people on the ground quickly, effectively and without complications. In addition to the package we put together last week, we will be providing an additional 15 million euros from the AKF during the next Council of Ministers on Wednesday – because timely help is twice as valuable,, said Federal Chancellor Karl Nehammer., Thus, emergency aid from Austria now totals 17.5 million euros, since Austria already responded rapidly last week and approved 2.5 million euros from the AKF as an initial aid measure. Of that amount, 1 million euros were allocated to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and 750,000 euros each to the Austrian Red Cross and Caritas for emergency humanitarian aid. In addition, the Ministry of the Interior sent two convoys to Ukraine with urgently needed helmets and body armour, as well as 100,000 litres of fuel, for civilian forces., The additional 15 million euros will now go to the ICRC, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and Austrian NGOs in Ukraine., We will not abandon the Ukrainian population in this difficult hour. Also in this war, the civilian population suffer disproportionately. That makes it all the more important to provide fast, supportive aid for refugees and displaced persons in Ukraine,, said Vice-Chancellor Werner Kogler., Ukraine’s humanitarian needs will be increasing rapidly due to the Russian war of aggression. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA) expects that up to 18 million people will be affected by the fighting, and approx. 7.5 million will be internally displaced. UNHCR estimates that approx. 1.2 million people will be seeking refuge beyond the country’s borders in the near future., Austria is in complete solidarity with Ukraine, which is currently falling victim to unprecedented military aggression. Wherever we can help Ukraine, we will do so with great commitment. This extensive aid package is intended to help ease the humanitarian suffering of the Ukrainian population and to provide emergency aid without red tape,, explained Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg., The Austrian funds will help supply the supported humanitarian organisations with food and water, as well as providing emergency shelter and basic medical care. A sharp increase in demand is expected when it comes to medical care for the wounded., Contact, Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs

It’s been a blur.” Like many in Kharkiv, Vladlena Salnykova, the chief doctor of Kharkiv’s Children’s Neurological Hospital № 5 pauses before answering questions about the timeline of horrific events that unfolded before her eyes starting February 24. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, has been under intense shelling by Russian forces. Fighting has caused extensive damage in many residential areas. Most of its population of 1.8 million has fled, but an estimated 500,000 people remain in the city., Before the shelling, a total of 190 children, from infants to just under age 18, were residents in the hospital or the children’s hospice unit, l1.5 kilometers away. When the shelling started, those who could be discharged were, and the staff relocated the remaining children to the hospice’s basement. “Only children with the most severe conditions are left here now,” one of the nurses, Tatyana told me. Salnykova said, “We don’t have enough staff to cover two buildings, so we all moved here. [The hospice’s] head doctor and I are here 24/7. Our building was not hit yet, God has spared us so far.”, She explained that evacuating the remaining children isn’t feasible for now. “Sixteen [of the] children have severe cerebral palsy, cannot walk. Seven others have other neurological conditions. We have a mother with a tiny baby. The children require constant care. The last evacuation … to Lviv was on a bus not equipped to transport children with severe health conditions. We need to evacuate them, but how?”, Meanwhile, supplies are dwindling., On March 1, a shell damaged a V. Korolenko boarding school for blind children, in another Kharkiv neighborhood. Valentina Butenko, the director of Right to Choose, a group that works with people with disabilities has worked closely with the school for years. She said the attack happened while children were having lunch in the basement of the three-story school building. The building withstood the blast, but the shock from the explosion shook the building and blew out all the windows. “Glass shards flew everywhere, children fell to the floor, they were terrified,” said Butenko. One girl was injured, and the director of the school sustained a head wound from a glass shard. All the schools’ children have since been evacuated., However other people with disabilities in and around Kharkiv have not been able to evacuate. Many live in the outskirts or in areas that have come under heavy shelling and lost electricity. Butenko said that before the war 45 volunteers supported about 300 people who are blind or have low vision in Kharkiv. Many of the volunteers have left and many people in Kharkiv are without phone service, making it difficult to provide support to people with disabilities, including to arrange for their evacuation., Russia and Ukraine had agreed in principle to establish humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of “peaceful” civilians and delivery of medicine and food to the areas most affected by the conflict. However, efforts to evacuate civilians from Kharkiv and several other cities were halted as continuous fighting made it extremely dangerous for civilians to be on the move., Civilians in Kharkiv and other areas of heavy fighting, who want to leave, need to be able to do so in safety. All armed forces should respect international humanitarian law and ensure civilians can evacuate., In a landmark resolution on people with disabilities in 2019 the UN Security reiterated the need for all parties in conflicts to allow and facilitate safe, timely and unimpeded humanitarian access to all people in need of assistance, as required under international humanitarian law. Both Ukraine and Russia are also parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which continues to apply throughout the conflict. The Convention imposes an obligation on state parties to act in accordance with their obligations under international humanitarian law and take all necessary measures to ensure the protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of armed conflict. Parties should strictly observe the laws of war, so that they can meet these obligations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/under-shelling-kharkiv
Medical Relief for the Ukrainian population,News and Press Release,Johanniter,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",7 Mar 2022,"The focus of Johanniter relief shifts to the medical sector, Due to the war in Ukraine, medical care for hundreds of thousands of people in the country is no longer guaranteed. This is particularly dangerous for seriously ill patients like those in the oncology sector. Johanniter in North Rhine-Westphalia transported 21 children and adolescents from the pediatric oncology hospital in Odessa to various hospitals in North Rhine-Westphalia after their arrival at the University Hospital in Essen., Additionally, at the request of various hospitals, Johanniter has already received 13 Ukrainian children with cancer and their families in Malogoszcz near the Polish-Ukrainian border and transported them to University Hospitals in Greifswald and in the Hamburg region. During the trip to Germany, the patients were cared for by Johanniter medical staff., Medical Relief for Ukraine, In addition to transporting patients out of Ukraine, Johanniter also supplies various hospitals in Ukraine with medicines and medical materials to ensure that the sick and injured are cared for on site. ""A semitrailer truck with 20 tons of food, hygiene items and medicines arrived in Luzk and Chitomir on 5th March. There, it was handed over directly to local agencies for the supply of people,"" says Ulrich Kraus, coordinator of Johanniter relief transports to Eastern Europe. ""In the coming days, we will drive further urgently needed medical supplies to Ukraine. We are able to realize this thanks to the many private monetary donations and the support of a wide range of companies."", Fact-finding missions in Moldova and Poland, Not only acute aid with relief transports is essential for the region. ""We have to be prepared for the fact that this war will put the entire region to the test for a long time,"" says Anette Müller, head of the Johanniter task force. ""Especially countries like Romania and Moldova cannot manage this for a long time without help. Moldova, for example, has already seen 70,000 refugees arrive. For a country with a population of 1.5 million, that's a big number, and the fear of war in their own country is great."", In order to assess on the ground what assistance is needed beyond the ongoing emergency relief efforts, Johanniter will send a two-person assessment team to the region on 8th March. At the same time, a second Johanniter team will travel to Poland to plan further aid for Ukraine together with the already installed United Nations coordination offices., Refugee Assistance in Germany, Johanniter is also active in Germany, where staff care for incoming refugees from Ukraine. ""At the moment, primarily women and children who have family members and friends still in Ukraine are arriving. The refugees often have had traumatic experiences. Adequate accommodation, special protection and intensive care are needed here,"" says Anne Ernst, Head of the Crisis Management & Emergency Relief Division at Johanniter., ""Another challenge is the continuing high numbers of COVID-19 infections in Germany. Many of those arriving now have no or insufficient vaccination protection against the virus. We, therefore, hope to be able to offer adequate vaccination and testing services to as many arrivals as possible.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/medical-relief-ukrainian-population
"MSF's first international medical supplies arrive in Kyiv, Ukraine",News and Press Release,MSF,Health,7 Mar 2022,"At approximately 6 p.m. local time in Ukraine, Saturday, March 5, a Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) emergency response team in Ukraine met with Oleksandr Kamyshin, Chairman of the Board of Ukrainian Railways. MSF’s first international supplies had arrived in Ukraine and had been unloaded in the warehouse just a few hours before., “The hospitals in Kyiv are desperate for supplies. We have what they need—can you help us get it to Kyiv?” we asked. By midnight, the first batch of medical kits and supplies were loaded, and the train was ready to depart., “It was urgent to do this fast,” said Christopher Stokes, MSF emergency coordinator in Ukraine. “We may be in a race against time here. We have no certainty how long train access to Kyiv will remain possible. We chose to go with the train option for reasons of speed and high volume capacity.”, The supplies were selected to respond to war trauma. The shipment included surgical kits, trauma kits, and basic necessities for intensive care units, emergency rooms, and surgical operating theaters, such as instruments, equipment, medicines, drugs, and other items—approximately 1,400 cubic feet of supplies., MSF received confirmation at 3:30 p.m. on March 6 local time in Ukraine that the supplies were safely received by the Ministry of Health in Kyiv. They are now being sent on to hospitals in the city and other towns further east where the numbers of people wounded is rising and supplies are running out quickly., Increasingly urgent requests for medical supplies are coming in from many hospitals and health facilities in the most severely war-affected parts of Ukraine. MSF will seek ways to donate what is needed, where it is needed. More MSF international supplies are will arrive in Ukraine in the coming days. Conflict-experienced MSF medical teams are starting to arrive in Ukraine from Moldova, Hungary, and Poland., “This war is brutal and high-intensity,” says Stokes. “Sending surgical teams to do hands-on medical work will be challenging, but we are actively looking at what could be possible. Even distributing supplies to hospitals will be hard. We know it has taken time, but we are scaling up fast, and these are the much-needed first steps as we build our concrete medical response.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/msfs-first-international-medical-supplies-arrive-kyiv-ukraine

"Calls for civilians to be protected as two children killed while fleeing Irpin, Ukraine",News and Press Release,Save the Children,Protection and Human Rights,7 Mar 2022,"KYIV, 7 March 2022 – Save the Children is outraged at the deaths of eight people, including a woman and her two children, killed in a mortar shell attack on Sunday as they tried to flee the town of Irpin on the outskirts of Kyiv. The children – a teenage boy and primary school age girl – had been gathered with their mother and other civilians near a bridge, and were caught in the open by the mortar shells., All children in Ukraine – at least 7.5 million under 18-year-olds - are in grave danger of physical harm, severe emotional distress, and displacement, following the breakout of large-scale conflict., Explosions and street fighting are ramping up in cities across the country including the capital Kyiv, forcing children and families into freezing basements and bomb shelters, some without power or heating. Parents are trying to calm terrified children., Irina Saghoyan, Save the Children’s Eastern Europe Director, said:, “Save the Children is deeply saddened by the attack on Sunday that killed two children along with their mother and five other civilians. These senseless deaths are the brutal cost of the conflict – it’s the most innocent that pay the highest price. Already dozens of children have been killed in this conflict. More have lost parents and loved ones. We mourn deeply for these lives that didn’t have a chance to be fully lived., “For the children who witnessed this incident, without support, their suffering may last for years. They may struggle with anxiety and depression, or have nightmares, re-living the horror of the experience., “‘Children must be protected from attacks. All must respect international humanitarian and human rights laws and take all necessary actions to minimise civilian harm. Perpetrators of crimes against children – including children caught in the crossfire - must be held to account and brought to justice. Impunity for violations of children’s rights feed into the narrative that these crimes are tolerable, and we cannot accept a world where that is the reality.”, While hostilities continue, Save the Children is gravely concerned that children will continue to have their rights violated, be caught up in the fighting, separated from their families, and exposed to trauma, violence, abuse and exploitation., Save the Children has been operating in eastern Ukraine since 2014. Throughout the 8-year conflict, we have been delivering essential humanitarian aid to children and their families, including distributing winter kits and hygiene kits, providing cash grants to families so they can meet basic needs such as food, rent and medicines, or so they can invest in starting new businesses. Our specialist support children in having access to safe, inclusive, quality education and are working with schools and community centres to help children overcome the mental and psychological impacts of their experiences of conflict and violence and increase their resilience and ability to cope with stresses in their daily lives., The Children Emergency Fund allows Save the Children to respond wherever the need is greatest to reach children quickly with the essentials they need to survive, ENDS, NOTES TO EDITORS, Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering essential humanitarian aid to children and their families. This includes supporting their access to education, providing psychosocial support, distributing winter kits and hygiene kits, and providing cash grants to families so they can meet basic needs such as food, rent and medicines, or so they can invest in new businesses., We now have a team in Poland, coordinating with local partners to assess the situation and respond to needs as quickly as we can. In Romania, Save the Children staff and volunteers continue to help refugees arriving from Ukraine at the border and in reception centres with provision of basic non-food items and other outreach services. For many years now, Save the Children has been working with refugee and migrant children inside and outside of Europe, aiming to support vulnerable children with the greatest needs. We run reception centres providing child friendly activities and work on informing children about their rights in Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy and Norway.

ACTED’s objective is assist an initial 300,000 people, internally displaced or affected by conflict inside Ukraine or who have sought refuge in Moldova, Romania and Poland., As a result of the military operations in Ukraine that started on February 24th 2022, at least 4 million people have left their homes (source: REACH). Within just a week since the start of intensified hostilities, nearly 3 million people are reportedly internally displaced and over 1 million people (source: UNHCR, 3rd of March 2022) – essentially women, children and the elderly have crossed the borders into the neighbouring countries of Poland (over 604,000), Hungary (133,000), Romania (51,00), Moldova (98,000) and Slovakia (79,000). Approximately 120,000 people were evacuated from eastern Ukraine to Russia in the day before the conflict intensified. According to OCHA, the population affected by the conflict in Ukraine now reaches 18 million people out of which 12 million are in need of humanitarian assistance., Although the ongoing fighting make the evaluation of existing and immediate needs difficult, we can expect them to massive and widespread, affecting all regions of Ukraine, neighbouring countries and beyond. Populations trapped in the cities affected by shelling, IDPs and refugees lack everything: food and basic relief items, housing, psycho-social support and protection., The crisis is taking on a new dimension as several major cities are now under fire with civilian populations unable to leave or facing dangerous journeys out. One of the central problems will soon be the disruptions of markets in the areas still spared by the conflict, with high inflation and shortages of commodities., Current scenarios indicate that as many as seven million people could be displaced if the situation continues to deteriorate, with 18 million impacted, including those already in need and displaced in Eastern Ukraine since 2014., Our action in Ukraine since 2015, Present in Ukraine since 2015, ACTED quickly mobilised its 150 staff and its networks of local partners across the country. Our first priority has been to provide direct cash assistance directly to vulnerable populations in the conflict zones. Earlier this week, ACTED also distributed hot meals to people waiting to cross the border with Poland for more than 48 hours in sub-zero temperatures. ACTED is now extending its activities to deliver critical assistance to displaced persons in the main hosting regions and to support self-help an local organizations groups that have spontaneously formed and provide assistance in Ukraine. Finally, ACTED is also taking part in the ongoing efforts to provide humanitarian assistance to refugees in the neighbouring countries of Poland, Romania and Moldavia where 3 humanitarian response teams have been deployed., Considering the immense scale of the crisis, ACTED is planning a large-scale humanitarian response to the Ukrainian crisis, with a three-pronged approach coordinated from our office in Lviv, including the delivery of: 1) life-saving humanitarian assistance in areas directly affected by the hostilities; 2) assistance to populations that are internally displaced and in transit; 3) humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable refugees who have recently arrived in Moldova, Romania and Poland., ACTED’s objective is assist an initial 300,000 people, internally displaced or affected by conflict inside Ukraine or who have sought refuge in Moldova, Romania and Poland., To support this major operation, ACTED is launching an appeal for donations with an initial target of 100 million EUR.

Thousands of people from Kyiv and further east have fled towards the western city of Lviv where FCA’s partner, Hungarian Interchurch Aid (HIA) has established a base for operations., “As Lviv has yet not been the site of military action, HIA and FCA decided that it was an ideal location from which to help people in Ukraine,” said Jouni Hemberg, Executive Director, FCA. “We have a long relationship with HIA working in other crisis and we work well together. We are already supporting their work aiding refugees on the border of Hungary, so when they decided to establish operations in Lviv, it was with our wholehearted support.”, As an immediate response to the people in Lviv, HIA is planning to meet basic needs with food, water, blankets and soap as they assess how to scale up the operation., “Waves of displaced people are arriving day by day – by train, by bus, car. Most of them trying to flee to one of the borders. This is the first place where they can feel a moment of safety. Most of the people we have talked to here had to leave with only hours of notice. They packed whatever they could and left most of their belongings behind,” said Giuliano Stochino, Regional Coordinator, HIA, who is based in Lviv., “It’s relatively safe and organised calm (in Lviv). There’s no panic, rather, an amazing level of humanitarian response to the needs arising. Everybody is trying to help in whatever way that they can, be that from the volunteers who are providing two or three meals at the train station or people working at the coordination points,” said Stochino., According to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) 1.5 million people have been displaced by the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and over a million people have fled across borders during the past week. An indeterminate number of people are displaced within Ukraine, including many migrants and asylum seekers from other countries., “There is a huge need to scale up this response. We are seeing that people are staying longer; about ten to fifteen percent have declared that they will stay inside the country,” said Stochino., “We will offer our support to everyone fleeing the conflict, targeting the most vulnerable and those most in need,” said Hemberg. “Over the following days and weeks we will continue to assess and adapt our operations to ensure that we help in the best way possible,” he added., For an interview with Jouni Hemberg or Guiliano Stochino, please contact:, HELSINKI – Erik Nyström, erik.nystrom(at)kua.fi +358 5038 07250, COPENHAGEN – Melany Markham melany.markham(at) kua.fi +45 9194 2670",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/finn-church-aid-supports-operations-ukraine
Good Neighbors Statement on the Ukrainian Humanitarian Crisis: Urge global community solidarity to protect women and children,News and Press Release,Good Neighbors International,Protection and Human Rights,7 Mar 2022,"Good Neighbors deplores the escalation of violence in Ukraine. We call for an immediate ceasefire and a complete cessation of hostilities. We encourage opposing forces to pursue a peaceful solution by means of dialogue and diplomacy., We urge all parties involved in the conflict to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and human rights law. This includes an immediate end to the targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure including residential areas, schools and hospitals, that has been widely reported and independently verified., As a child rights and child protection organization, Good Neighbors is especially concerned about physical and psychological harm to children. At least 17 children have been killed and 30 injured as of March 3rd, according to UNICEF. Reported violations of the Children and Armed Conflict Mandate constitute heinous acts that duty bearers will be hold to account for. No child should fear for their life nor see their future at risk. They should not see their family torn apart by war nor their house destroyed by shelling., UNHCR’s refugee count as of March 3rd is of around 1.2 million people. The agency has also reported growing numbers of unaccompanied minors entering bordering countries, having left their parents or guardians behind in Ukraine. We are greatly concerned by the protection risks faced by children traveling on their own. We welcome the Blue Dot approach adopted by UNICEF and UNHCR, that offers tailored services, support and information to individuals, including children, based on their status and needs., Children, girls, unaccompanied minors, women, elderly people and people with disabilities are among the most vulnerable groups suffering from this war. Regardless of whether they are staying in their place of origin, on the move within Ukraine or crossing international borders, these categories are at the most risk of harm. Good Neighbors praises the efforts of local and international communities to ensure their basic needs are met and that adequate protection services are made available wherever they are., We view favorably the recent agreement between belligerents to establish humanitarian and evacuation corridors. However, observers will judge based on actions, not mere words. Therefore, we demand immediate fulfillment of this agreement, ensuring the safety of civilians and of vulnerable groups in particular. We urge parties to guarantee full, unimpeded and safe access to humanitarian agencies and their staff, taking all necessary measures to guarantee their security., We urge neighboring states to maintain an open border policy and admit everyone fleeing from Ukraine regardless of their nationality, status, ethnicity, race, gender, age, religion, sexuality, ability or any other factor. Every individual has an equal right in terms of access to safe territory. We condemn the episodes of discrimination that have occurred at some border points, trusting that protection agencies on the ground and authorities in charge will ensure this does not happen again., Good Neighbors is profoundly concerned about growing humanitarian needs. People in Ukraine and crossing borders are running short of water, food, fuel, medicines, clothes, personal items, basic services, and shelter options. Freezing winter temperatures and the additional risks brought by the COVID-19 pandemic pose an additional threat to people’s health and well-being. The current nationwide humanitarian crisis overlaps with the protracted situation in Eastern Ukraine, where ongoing hostilities have been causing significant human suffering over a span of years., Good Neighbors commits to taking immediate action in support of internally displaced persons in Ukraine and refugees seeking safety in bordering countries where help is most needed. As of March 3rd Good Neighbors, humanitarian response team has been dispatched to Romania with the goal of supporting refugees in collaboration with local communities and authorities., We pledge to support local actors to build up their response capacity and guarantee the safeguarding of the refugee we assist. We will coordinate with national and local authorities responsible for persons of concern and with other relevant entities on the ground, including the UN and other humanitarian agencies. Our thoughts go out to every person suffering in this war., Good Neighbors is an international humanitarian development NGO founded in 1991 to make the world a place without hunger, where people live together in harmony.

"Ukraine Emergency: Key Informant Interviews - March 5, 2022",Assessment,WFP,Logistics and Telecommunications,7 Mar 2022,"INTRODUCTION
From 3-5 March 2022, the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) conducted Key Informant Interviews (KII) in order to better understand key information and communication needs among the affected populations in West Ukraine. Below is the summary of the main KII findings., ACCESS TO INFORMATION
All key informants (KIs) stated that they have so far relied on trusted sources of information to take informed decisions for themselves and their families. The reliance on mobile data connectivity is very high; however for the older population the main source of information is broadcast television., NATIONAL LEVEL:
• In order to streamline information, Ukrainian media agreed to streamline information through state bpradcast, provided to the population with aligned 24/7 updates through TV, radio and linked YouTube channel on the following topics:
o Conflict with Russia
o Political activity
o Humanitarian activity (access to water, food, shelter)
o Evacuation routes
o Official briefings from all government branches, including Ukrainian President’s briefings twice daily, MUNICIPAL LEVEL:
• Municipalities have hotlines providing information on evacuation
• Municipalities have Telegram channels designed to share information on:
o Conflict with Russia o Political activity o Humanitarian activity (access to water, food, shelter)
o Evacuation routes
o Curfew
o Calls for volunteers to join efforts to restore damaged infrastructure
• Mayors use a single unified channel to provide municipal updates on the following topics:
o Conflict with Russia
o Political activity
o Humanitarian activity (access to water, food, shelter)
o Evacuation routes, GRASSROOTS LEVEL:
• Citizens self-organize and coordinate emergency response via social media apps: Telegram, Facebook Messenger and Whatsapp.
• Citizens keep in touch with friends and family via Telegram, Facebook Messenger and Viber.
• Information Needs:, INFRASTRUCTURE
• Internet Connectivity
o 24/7 access unless heavy fighting nearby, but outages have been restored quickly
• Mobile Network coverage
o 24/7 access unless heavy fighting nearby, but outages have been restored quickly
o 3G coverage estimated over 90% of the country / 4G coverage estimated over 75% of the country
o Most people have 2+ SIM Cards for different Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) in case one MNO is experiencing temporary problems.
o MNOs are keeping in touch with their customers through Facebook, to report problems and disseminate information on the network.
▪ Problem: No roaming agreements between MNO within Ukraine
• Electricity
o 24/7 access unless heavy fighting nearby, but outages have been restored quickly
o Is frequently targeted by Russian army
▪ Problem: if humanitarian corridor opens up for evacuation / supplies, how can the populations disconnected as a result of heavy fighting be informed (for example, in Mariupol), POPULAR TECHNOLOGY
• Application “Air Raid Alert”
o Launched in early March 2022 in collaboration with the Ministry of Digital Transformation as an early warning system
o Goal: to alert the user of the beginning and end of an air raid in the vicinity of selected municipality
• Chatbots
o A myriad of chatbots have sprung up on Telegram since the beginning of conflict
o Chatbots may have different geographic scopes: national, municipal or city-level
o Chatbots can be filtered by geographic scope or by type of service required
o Purposes:
▪ Exchanging information on conflict with Russia
▪ Security updates
▪ Matching the population with volunteers (food, transportation, fuel, shelter, special needs among elderly or persons with disabilities) in particular geographic areas
▪ Matching individuals in need of particular service with specific service provider in a geographic area (i.e. mother of three children looking for transportation to a safer location)
▪ Sharing up-to-date maps of nearby open pharmacies
▪ Sharing up-to-date maps of nearby open grocery stores
▪ Sharing up-to-date maps of nearby bomb shelters
▪ Tutorials on administering first aid
▪ Evacuation routes
▪ Humanitarian assistance
▪ Locating medical facilities
▪ Supplying body armour (bulletproof vests, ballistic helmets, etc.)

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24.00 5 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],Situation Report,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,6 Mar 2022,"From 4 am on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 12 midnight on 5 March 2022 (local time), the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 1,123 civilian casualties in the country: 364 killed and 759 injured. This included:, a total of 364 killed (74 men, 42 women, 8 boys, and 4 girls, as well as 13 children and 223 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 759 injured (67 men, 48 women, 11 girls, and 2 boys, as well as 28 children and 603 adults whose sex is yet unknown) o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 503 casualties (88 killed and 415 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 374 casualties (65 killed and 309 injured)
 On territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’: 129 casualties (23 killed and 106 injured) o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 620 casualties (276 killed and 344 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the real figures are considerably higher, especially in Governmentcontrolled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, the town of Volnovakha where there are allegations of hundreds of civilian casualties. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., OHCHR notes the report of the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, according to which as of 12 am (local time) 6 March, 38 children had been killed and 71 injured. OHCHR also notes a report by the National Police of Kharkiv region, according to which as of 10 am (local time) 5 March, the total number of civilian casualties in Kharkiv region was 126 killed (121 adults and 5 children) and 312 injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-5-march-2022-enruuk
Update 13 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (6 March 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,6 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that although regular staff continued to operate the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), the plant management is now under orders from the commander of the Russian forces that took control of the site last week, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., Furthermore, Ukraine reports that any action of plant management – including measures related to the technical operation of the six reactor units – requires prior approval by the Russian commander., The Director General expressed grave concern about this development as it contravenes one of the seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security that he outlined at the meeting of the IAEA’s Board of Governors on 2 March, convened to address the safety, security and safeguards implications of the situation in Ukraine., Pillar 3 states: “The operating staff must be able to fulfil their safety and security duties and have the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure”., In a second serious development, Ukraine has reported that the Russian forces at the site have switched off some mobile networks and the internet so that reliable information from the site cannot be obtained through the normal channels of communication., This has been confirmed by Ukraine’s nuclear regulator which informed the IAEA today that it had started having major problems in communicating with staff operating the Zaporizhzhya NPP. Less than 24 hours after Ukraine’s regulatory authority said it had been able to maintain communications with Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant, it today said the phone lines, as well as e-mails and fax, were not functioning anymore. Mobile phone communication was still possible, but with poor quality., The contravenes another of the seven indispensable pillars, number 7: “There must be reliable communications with the regulator and others.”, “I’m extremely concerned about these developments that were reported to me today. Just a few days after I presented the seven main elements of nuclear safety and security to the IAEA Board, several of them are already being compromised. In order to be able to operate the plant safely and securely, management and staff must be allowed to carry out their vital duties in stable conditions without undue external interference or pressure,” Director General Grossi said., “The deteriorating situation regarding vital communications between the regulator and the Zaporizhzhya NPP is also a source of deep concern, especially during an armed conflict that may jeopardize the country’s nuclear facilities at any time. Reliable communications between the regulator and the operator are a critical part of overall nuclear safety and security,” he said., Despite the communication issues, the regulator was able to provide updated information about the operational status of the Zaporizhzhya NPP and to confirm that radiation levels there remained normal. Of the six reactors, Unit 1 is in planned maintenance until mid-2022, Unit 2 now operates at full capacity, Unit 3 is in a cold shutdown state, Unit 4 is operating at near full capacity, Unit 5 is cooling down for a cold reserve state, and Unit 6 is in cold shutdown., In one positive development, operational teams at the plant were now rotating in three shifts. But there were problems with availability and supply of food, which was having a negative impact on staff morale, the regulator said., The regulator also reported that it was facing problems communicating with personnel at the Chornobyl NPP, which at the moment was only possible with e-mails. Russian forces took control of the site of the 1986 accident on 24 February. At the Chornobyl NPP, the staff of more than 200 technical personnel and guards have still not been able to rotate since 23 February, it said., Director General Grossi has repeatedly stressed the importance of operating staff being able to rest to carry out their important jobs safely and securely., “I call on those in effective control of the Chornobyl NPP to immediately allow staff there to rotate for the sake of safety and security,” he said., In another concerning development, communications have also been lost with all enterprises and institutions in the port city of Mariupol that use Category 1-3 radiation sources and there was no information about their status, the regulator said. Such radioactive material can cause serious harm to people if not secured and managed properly., The Director General reiterated his readiness to travel to the Chornobyl NPP to secure the commitment to the safety and security of all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants from the parties of the conflict in the country.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-13-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-6-march-2022-enru

Urgent evacuations remain impossible in the towns of Bucha and Hostomel outside the capital that have come under increasingly intense attacks in recent days., • The human cost of the current conflict continues to rise. Between 4 a.m. on 24 February and midnight on 5 March, OHCHR reports at least 1,123 civilian casualties, including 364 killed, a more than 410 per cent increase compared to 26 February when OHCHR reported 240 civilian casualties. The actual number of civilian casualties is likely to be higher as civilian deaths and injuries continue to be verified., • Children in conflict-stricken areas and those displaced by the conflict – the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) says around 500,000 children have already fled Ukraine – continue to be disproportionately affected. Following the closure of schools countrywide, access to education has been impacted for around 5.7 million children and adolescents., • Despite the access challenges, the Government of Ukraine, UN agencies and humanitarian partners continue to rapidly scale up relief activities inside Ukraine, where the security situation permits, while neighbouring countries are receiving growing numbers of refugees., SITUATION OVERVIEW, On 5 March, the safe passage of civilians trapped in Mariupol and Volnovakha (Government-controlled areas of Donetska oblast) was impossible as fighting raged on despite a negotiated ceasefire agreed to by the sides to the ongoing hostilities., After initially being confirmed for the following day, on 6 March, the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol (Donetska oblast, south-east) – home to around 400,000 people – was eventually suspended due to reported clashes along the evacuation routes. Despite this, around 300 people were reportedly relocated from Mariupol to the non-Government-controlled areas of Donetska oblast. Also, on 6 March, the head of the Ukrainian delegation for talks with the Russian Federation stated that there was a possibility of a “humanitarian corridor” out of Kharkiv – a conflict-ravaged city of 1.4 million inhabitants in northeastern Ukraine. At the time of writing, it remains unclear if evacuations have gotten underway in Kharkiv. “Windows of silence” and “safe passage” are urgently needed to relocate people whose lives are at great risk. Provision of life-saving humanitarian relief supplies, including food, water and medicine, to affected people who have been cut off from such assistance due to the military encirclement of cities across Ukraine, remains critical. In Kherson – home to around 290,000 people in southern Ukraine – 30 trucks stocked with humanitarian relief supplies have been unable to reach affected people in the city due to ongoing armed clashes., Despite the access challenges, the Government of Ukraine, UN agencies and humanitarian partners continue to scale up relief activities inside Ukraine, where the security situation permits, while neighbouring countries are receiving growing numbers of displaced people. On 6 March, the first Government-led humanitarian convoy left Zaporizhzhia carrying around 90 tons of humanitarian relief supplies was expected to reach Mariupol., The human cost of the conflict continues to rise. Between 4 a.m. on 24 February and midnight on 5 March, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports at least 1,123 civilian casualties, including 364 killed, a more than 410 per cent increase compared to 26 February when OHCHR reported 240 civilian casualties. The actual number of civilian casualties is likely to be much higher as civilian deaths and injuries continue to be verified. In terms of displacement, UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reports that more than 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries over the past 10 days, including more than 885,000 people in Poland alone, along with over 169,000 in Hungary, nearly 114,000 in Slovakia and more than 84,000 in the Republic of Moldova., OHCHR reports 503 casualties in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (65 killed and 309 injured in Government-controlled areas and 23 killed and 106 injured in non-Government-controlled areas) and 620 civilian casualties in other regions of Ukraine. Eastern Ukraine continues to suffer the greatest human costs of escalating hostilities, recording nearly 45 per cent of all civilian casualties across the country so far. On 5 March, the most extensive damages to civilian infrastructure were witnessed in Bucha (Kyivsky oblast), Cherniv (north), Kharkiv (north-east) and Korosten (north)., Violent clashes continue to intensify outside Kyiv as Russian forces move closer to the capital. Urgent evacuations remain impossible in the towns of Bucha and Hostomel outside the capital that have come under increasingly intense attacks in recent days. In Borodianka, a small town some 60 km from Kyiv, a psychiatric hospital has been reportedly impacted by the military offensive with around 670 people inside – including patients with special needs who require continuous, roundthe-clock assistance, some of whom have been bedridden for years. According to local authorities, the hospital is quickly running out of water and essential medicines., The growing health needs emerging from the conflict are placing increasing pressure on an already-strained health system dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic for the past two years. As the geographic scope of the conflict expands, more than 200 health facilities are now located along active conflict lines or in changed areas of control, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). There are already signs of a lack of available beds for trauma patients and people with other conditions, like COVID-19, while it is likely that health personnel shortages will emerge due to ongoing insecurity and the displacement of health workers themselves, with the Ministry of Health already suspending scheduled hospitalizations and elective procedures., Children in conflict-stricken areas and those displaced by the conflict – the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) says around 500,000 children have already fled Ukraine – continue to be disproportionately affected. Following the closure of schools countrywide due to ongoing hostilities, access to education has been impacted for around 5.7 million children and adolescents between 3 and 17 years of age. According to the Ministry of Education and Science, at least 160 educational facilities have been damaged, although this figure has yet to be verified by the Education Cluster. The current circumstances only further exacerbate the multi-faceted impacts on educational outcomes and mental health for children and adolescents brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing the risk of school dropout rates and negative coping mechanisms.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-6-march-2022
Emergency medical supplies rushed to Kyiv by train from Ukraine warehouse,News and Press Release,MSF,"Health
Logistics and Telecommunications",6 Mar 2022,"Around 6pm local time, Saturday 5 March, one of Médecins Sans Frontières’ (MSF) emergency response teams in Ukraine met Oleksandr Kamyshin, Chairman of the Board of Ukrainian Railways. MSF’s first international supplies had arrived in Ukraine, and had been unloaded in the warehouse, just a few hours before., “The hospitals in Kyiv are desperate for supplies – we have what they need – can you help us get it to Kyiv?”, Simple question, and rapid answer. By midnight, the first batch of medical kits and supplies was loaded, and the train set to depart., “It was urgent to do this fast,” says Christopher Stokes, MSF Emergency Coordinator in Ukraine. “We may be in a race against time here – we have no certainty how long train access to Kyiv will remain possible. We chose to go with the train option for reasons of speed and the high volume capacity.”, The supplies have been selected to treat trauma injuries typical of war settings. They include surgical kits, trauma kits, and basic necessities for intensive care units (ICUs), emergency rooms and surgical operating theatres. These necessities include instruments, equipment, medicines, drugs and other items. In total, around 40m3 of supplies have been sent., We received confirmation at 15:30 local time that the supplies had been safely received by the Ministry of Health in Kyiv. They are now being sent on to hospitals in the city, and in other towns further east, where the numbers of wounded are rising and supplies are dwindling fast., Increasingly urgent requests for medical supplies are coming in from many hospitals and health facilities in the more war-affected parts of Ukraine. MSF will seek ways to donate what is needed, where it is needed. More MSF supplies will be arriving in Ukraine, from international supply points, in the coming days, to enable more medical facilities to be re-supplied. Conflict-experienced MSF medical teams are also starting to arrive in Ukraine, from Moldova, Hungary and Poland., “This war is brutal and high-intensity,” says Stokes. “Sending surgical teams to do hands-on medical work will be challenging, but we are actively looking at what could be possible.”, “Even distributing supplies to hospitals will be hard,” continues Stokes. “We know it has taken time, but we are scaling up fast – and these are the much-needed first steps as we build our concrete medical response.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/emergency-medical-supplies-rushed-kyiv-train-ukraine-warehouse
"Ukraine: UN chief calls for safe passage from conflict zones, rights body records 1,123 civilian casualties, WHO outlines health concerns [EN/RU]",News and Press Release,UN News,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",6 Mar 2022,"UN chief António Guterres called on Sunday for a pause in fighting to allow civilians to escape conflict zones in Ukraine, as the UN rights body (OHCHR) announced it had recorded 1,123 civilian casualties since the beginning of Russia’s armed attack on the country., In a Tweet, the UN Secretary-General declared that it is absolutely essential to establish a pause in the fighting that continues unabated in Ukraine, to allow for the safe passage of civilians from all conflict zones, and also to ensure that life-saving humanitarian aid, such as the UN supplies that began arriving on Saturday, can move in to help those who remain., Mr. Guterres singled out the cities of Mariupol, Kharkiv and Sumy as examples of hotspots where civilians are at particular risk. Attempts to allow some 200,000 civilians to safely leave Mariupol continue to be thwarted, with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) reporting “devastating scenes of human suffering” in the city., The ICRC reported on Sunday that, whilst their teams remain on standby to help with the evacuation, they need security guarantees in order to operate. These guarantees have so far not been forthcoming, and the humanitarian organization called on the warring parties to agree to specific terms that would allow for safe passage out of the city., Real fatality figures ‘considerably higher’ than recorded, The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) warned on Sunday that the casualty figures it has reported – for the period between 04:00 local time on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to midnight on 5 March 2022 – are likely to be a considerable underestimate of the true numbers., OHCHR said that 1,123 civilian casualties in Ukraine have been verified: 364 killed, including 25 children, and 759 injured. Most of the casualties have been caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., However, OHCHR believes that the real figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory, and especially in recent days, as information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. In the town of Volnovakha, for example, OHCHR is aware of allegations of hundreds of civilian casualties., ‘Fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since WW2’, The Ukraine conflict has created the fastest-growing refugee crisis since the Second World War, the head of the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), declared in a Tweeton Sunday., Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, noted that more than 1.5 million people have crossed into neighbouring countries in just 10 days., Mr. Grandi’s comments follow warnings from the UN children’s agency(UNICEF) on Friday of “unprecedented” numbers of children and families fleeing their homes, and humanitarian needs “growing by the hour”., WHO releases priority healthcare concerns for Ukraine, The UN health agency (WHO) released its first Ukraine situation report on Saturday, outlining its health priorities for the country., These include mental health care, due to what the agency calls “significant stress due to acute conflict”, and conflict-related trauma and injuries, exacerbated by lack of access to health facilities due to insecurity., WHO is also concerned about excess death from common illnesses, due to disruption in services, and acute maternal, new-born and child illnesses, as well as the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, measles, polio, TB, and HIV., Diarrhoeal diseases are also on the list of priorities, due to the widespread destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure, inadequate vaccination coverage, population movements, and crowding.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-un-chief-calls-safe-passage-conflict-zones-rights-body-records-1123-civilian
"Ukraine: ""We are calling for respect for human life""",News and Press Release,MSF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",6 Mar 2022,"Q&A with MSF’s emergency coordinator in Ukraine, In the besieged city of Mariupol, southeastern Ukraine, thousands of people—including Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff and their families—remain cut off from the world. Laurent Ligozat, MSF’s emergency coordinator in Lviv shares his concerns about the safety of civilians in the city., How is the situation in Mariupol? Are you in contact with your staff in the city?, The humanitarian situation in Mariupol is catastrophic. We know from our staff that they are desperately trying to keep safe as heavy attacks continue and food supplies run dangerously low. There is no water, electricity, or heating. Internet and phone services have been cut off. Hospitals, supermarkets, residential buildings have suffered heavy damages. And it is not possible to bring any relief supplies into the city. We spoke to one of our staff through satellite phone on Friday [March 4] and today [March 5] and he shared how people are literally being forced to live off snow. So, we fear for the safety of our staff as well as thousands of others who find themselves in such a harrowing situation., What are you trying to do to ensure your staff can leave the city?, In such desperate circumstances, one would think that the only option people have is to escape. But it is not as simple as it sounds. For many of our staff, Mariupol is home, where they have families and friends. They have memories and feelings attached to the place. They know that if they leave the city now, they may never come back, they may never see their homes. This is not the first time they are seeing war. They have experienced it already, when eight years back Donetsk split between government and separatist-controlled territories and they were cut off from many towns and cities across the contact line. So, they know it’s a life-altering choice for them., For those who would like to leave, we are trying all we can to help. We are in touch with other organizations as well to see how we can work together to get our staff out of Mariupol. Some of our staff have cars but for those who don’t we will make our cars available. But it goes beyond logistics. So, we are appealing to all power holders in Mariupol to ensure those who want to leave can do so safely., Why is MSF calling for safe passage?, It’s a [humanitarian] principle to allow people to escape when war is raging. Civilians caught in conflict must be protected. For us, the most important thing is the safety and dignity of all people. Having worked on the frontlines of so many war zones, we have seen immense suffering. We have seen the consequences of people being trapped between fighting lines, so we want to make an appeal: Spare civilian lives, spare all things people need to live a life with dignity. This means food supplies, water, heating, electricity. And allow those who want to leave to do so, and let those who want to stay, to live in peace and dignity. So, we are essentially calling for respect for human life., If all of MSF staff leave, does this mean you will stop all activities in eastern Ukraine?, We have been providing health care in eastern Ukraine for eight years, and now when the people need us more than ever, we will not abandon them. We have more staff coming into Ukraine to support our medical emergency response. For now, our immediate priority is to provide essential medical supplies to hospitals running low on much-needed stocks including surgical and trauma kits to ensure they can continue providing emergency health care. Many of the people in this part of Ukraine are elderly people with chronic health problems such as diabetes. So, we are also looking at how we can supply some hospitals in eastern Ukraine with insulin. Ensuring continuity of care for people will also be a key focus for us, as for elderly people with chronic symptoms, disruptions in treatment can be life-threatening.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-we-are-calling-respect-human-life

""On top of the hospitals facing supply-chain issues to cope with their normal patient-load, they are coming under added pressure as people fleeing their homes flock to hospitals as safe havens, to seek food and shelter., ""Hospital supplies are already dangerously low, and there are real fears that food will become a critical issue within coming weeks."", The cross-border humanitarian delivery came after World Vision met with the mayor of Siret to offer help with the refugee response, as the Romanian border town welcomed hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian migrants fleeing the conflict., “The people we met there were showing clear signs of emotional distress,” Daniel said. “These are people who don’t have connections, don’t have much money or means to get across the border and so are in great need of emergency assistance.

Ukraine: Safe passage for civilians from Mariupol halted for a second day; ICRC calls on parties to agree to specific terms [EN/RU],News and Press Release,ICRC,Protection and Human Rights,6 Mar 2022,"Geneva (ICRC) - Amid devastating scenes of human suffering in Mariupol, a second attempt today to start evacuating an estimated 200,000 people out of the city came to a halt. The failed attempts yesterday and today underscore the absence of a detailed and functioning agreement between the parties to the conflict., The ICRC is not and cannot in any way be the guarantor of a ceasefire agreement between the parties or of its implementation. As a neutral and impartial humanitarian intermediary, the ICRC has been facilitating the dialogue between the parties on the safe passage of civilians., For the safe passage of civilians to happen with the required levels of trust, the parties should agree between themselves not just in principle but also on the details and parameters. In particular:, In addition, the ICRC needs satisfactory security guarantees in order to operate. Today, our teams began opening up the evacuation route from Mariupol before hostilities resumed. Our teams remain in Mariupol and are ready to help facilitate further attempts if the parties reach a detailed agreement, which is for the parties alone to implement and respect., We remind the parties that staff, vehicles and buildings bearing the Red Cross emblems are protected under international law, as are the emblems themselves which must not be misused., We continue to remind the parties to the conflict of their obligations to respect international humanitarian law and to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure., For more information, please contact:

Safe passage and access for humanitarian aid must be a right not a privilege in Ukraine,News and Press Release,MSF,Protection and Human Rights,5 Mar 2022,"Following the soul-wrenching reports we received from trapped Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) staff in Mariupol, Ukraine, we are closely following the ongoing reports about an agreement for safe passage of civilians this weekend., It is vital that such opportunities for civilians to escape from areas of violent warfare are not one-off and time-limited offers. At MSF, we know how dangerous this can be for civilians who are not able or willing to leave, including medical staff that choose to remain to take care of sick and wounded people., “Every situation is different, but in our decades of experience working in situations of war we know that one-off humanitarian corridors can be helpful, but are not enough,” says Stephen Cornish, General Director of MSF. “Several times we have witnessed civilians encouraged to leave through time-bound civilian evacuation corridors, and then… those who could not or would not flee were met with extraordinary and indiscriminate violence unleashed on everyone and everything left behind.”, “As a result, many people were killed or maimed, including many medical staff and other civilians,” says Cornish., We call for the rules of war to be observed by all the military fighting in this war in Ukraine; to take all precautions to avoid harming civilians and to consider civilians as civilians at all times and in all places in the country. Safe passage for those willing and able to escape should be urgently assured in Mariupol and across war-affected areas inside Ukraine, regardless of the existence of humanitarian corridors or ceasefires that may temporarily be put in be in place., For those that stay behind, they cannot lose their civilian status; the warring parties must do all in their power to prevent harm to civilians at all times, in all places., MSF supports any kind of ceasefire initiative that allows safer passage for those wanting to flee and for medical and other humanitarian assistance to enter. But the right to seek safety and access for humanitarian aid should be an obligation and not a privilege everywhere in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/safe-passage-and-access-humanitarian-aid-must-be-right-not-privilege-ukraine

Update 12 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (5 March 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,5 Mar 2022,"Ukraine’s nuclear regulator told the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today it had been able to maintain communications with staff at the Zaporizhhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) where two out of six reactors were now operating, a day after Russian forces took control of the site in the country’s south-east, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., In regular updates to the IAEA, the Ukrainian regulatory authority and the plant management also confirmed that the technical safety systems were intact and radiation levels remained normal at Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant. One telephone communication line had been lost but another was still functioning, as was mobile phone communication., The Ukrainian counterparts told the IAEA that the facility’s training centre – located separately from the reactor units – had suffered significant damage during the events early on 4 March, when Ukraine says it was hit by a projectile and a localised fire broke out that was later extinguished. There had also been damage to the site’s laboratory building and to an administrative structure, they added., Of the plant’s six reactors, Unit 1 remained in planned maintenance, the operating power of Unit 2 had been increased to 760 Megawatt thermal (MWt) by 07:45 CET, Unit 3 had been disconnected from the grid and was in low power mode, Unit 4 was operating at 960MWt, which is near full capacity, and Units 5 and 6 were shutdown. The site’s spent fuel pools were operating normally. A visual inspection of the dry storage facility did not detect any damage, according to the information provided to the IAEA., The safety systems of Ukraine’s three other nuclear power plants were operating and the regulator continued to receive online monitoring data regarding radiation levels at the sites, which were also as usual. Six of their combined total of nine reactors were currently operating, the regulator said., Staff at the Chornobyl NPP – which is under the control of Russian forces since last week – have been on site since 23 February without being able to rotate the shift of technical personnel and guards, the regulator said., Director General Grossi has repeatedly stressed the importance of staff operating Ukraine’s nuclear facilities being allowed to rest and rotate in order to be able to carry out their jobs safely and securely. He has also said that a “tense” situation with Russian forces controlling the Zaporizhhzhya NPP site and Ukrainian staff operating it “certainly cannot last for too long”.

However, early reports indicate that shelling continues despite the ceasefire agreement, preventing the evacuation of people., The number of civilian causalities continues to mount. Between 4 a.m. on 24 February and midnight on 4 March, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports at least 1,058 civilian casualties, including 351 killed, a figure that is likely much higher as civilian deaths and injuries continue to be verified., As fighting continues to intensify, including in the outskirts of Kyiv, which have become hotspots of unrelenting violence, with many small towns outside Ukraine’s capital coming under intense shelling in recent days, people may be displaced multiple times, significantly increasing protection risks and humanitarian needs., Millions of people have been displaced since 24 February, with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reporting over 1.3 million people who have fled to neighbouring countries; more than of them – nearly 650,000 people – arriving in Poland., Local and national authorities, local non-governmental and civil society organizations, UN agencies and humanitarian partners continue to scale-up response activities, including in border areas. In the worst-affected areas of Ukraine, partners continue to leverage the presence and capacities of local organizations to deliver life-saving assistance to those most in need and adapt their response strategies to fit the new operational reality., On 4 March, the recently appointed UN Crisis Coordinator, Mr. Amin Awad, arrived in Ukraine, where he will lead the coordination of all UN efforts in the country, including the humanitarian response on both sides of the “contact line”.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-5-march-2022

This concerns, for example, the town of Volnovakha where hundreds of civilian casualties have been alleged. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., According to the Commissioner of the President of Ukraine for the Rights of the Child and Children’s Rehabilitation, as of 4 March, 28 children were killed and 64 were injured in Government-controlled territory., OHCHR also notes a report by the Ministry of Emergencies of Ukraine, according to which as of 9am (Kyiv time) 4 March, the total number of civilian casualties in Kharkiv region was 39 killed and 272 injured, including 10 children.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-4-march-2022-enruuk-0

Tens of thousands of children are in child-care institutions; many are living with disabilities., ""And then there are those children who are sick. Children wounded in hospitals in Kyiv. Yesterday I was at a children's hospital here in Lviv. Babies in the ICU, children on drips. Their escape is so much more complicated and dangerous. By way of just one example -- and there are hundreds -- I spoke to a first-time mother, Valeria, and her two-month child, Emma. They had survived extensive attacks in Dnipro and then driven for ten hours to the relative safety of Lviv. Two-month-old Emma had coughed blood so they were at the hospital. Through tears Valeria told me ""mentally I am fine. Physically I am not. I want Emma to have a future. I want to know that she will still have both parents, alive"". This is what mothers have been reduced to ask for in Ukraine., ""As fighting continues, last night thousands of children spent another freezing and terrifying night in bunkers, their homes under siege.

The home is a sanctuary for children whose parents have found themselves in difficult life circumstances and are unable to cope with parenting responsibilities; that have been abandoned; or whose parents’ parental rights are being taken away for legal reasons. “We have 58 children in our care right now, from small babies of a few months up to the age of 4 years-old,” says Irina. “We also have a group of disabled children. My usual role is to help develop speech, attention and memory, but these days – like all my colleagues – we do all we can to help feed, clean and protect our children.”, “When the shelling started, we took the children down to the basement of the children’s home, but it was horrible down there,” says Irina. “We’ve since taken them to one of the churches, where they all are now.”, “Yesterday [March 1] was a terrible day for us. The shelling intensified and we heard gunshots. We are asking everyone, ‘Please let us leave the city and take the children to a safe place’."", War can have a devastating effect on children’s mental and physical health, with potentially life-long consequences. That is why children must be protected from harm during conflict situations and never be targeted., Since the onset of the military offensive in Ukraine, WHO has called to protect the right to health at any cost.

Ukraine crisis will have catastrophic impact on global hunger,News and Press Release,Plan International,Food and Nutrition,4 Mar 2022,"The devastating crisis in Ukraine and the need to prevent it from becoming a conflict-hunger and nutrition crisis means we must not wait until Ukraine reaches food security emergency levels to react. At the same time, we must ensure the global hunger crisis is not further aggravated - particularly in the 20 hunger hotspots., Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Sudan, Central African Republic and the countries in the Central Sahel, among others, are facing alarming levels of food insecurity. With a third of world wheat supplies coming from Ukraine and Russia, hunger could increase across the world. Popularly known as the ‘bread basket of Europe’, and home to the world’s most fertile soil, Ukraine has for years supplied the world with sunflower oil, barley, maize, and wheat, as well as fertilisers., KNOCK-ON EFFECTS ON FOOD CRISES, “The Sahel region of West Africa, already stricken by hunger, relies on wheat supplies from Ukraine,’ says Sven Coppens, Director, Plan International, Coastal West Africa. “The conflict in Europe will trigger even higher food prices, meaning it can only worsen the hunger crisis in countries here such as Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger., Now, just at the start of the spring harvest season, the war in Ukraine means fields won’t be prepared, crops won’t be planted, fertilisers won’t be available; bringing potentially devastating consequences not only for children caught up in the conflict, but for the entire world, particularly those places already crippled by hunger., Furthermore, according to the UN, sanctions on procurement from and transaction with Russia could have a ripple effect on humanitarian operations in West and Central Africa, while operations relying on imports transiting through Russian territory might also be disrupted., GLOBAL FOOD PRICES ARE RISING, Before last week, global food prices were already rising at an alarming rate, and a spiralling hunger crisis currently envelopes huge swathes of West and Central Africa, East Africa and other countries such as Bangladesh, Haiti and Honduras., Conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic are contributing to a dramatic escalation in food insecurity, and it is estimated that an unprecedented 283 million people may already be acutely food insecure or at high risk in 80 countries. The crisis in Ukraine will mean disrupted supply chains and even higher prices, which could have far-reaching and long-lasting consequences for people who are already acutely hungry., “Many of these nations that are food insecure are already dealing with conflict, and the combination of hunger, conflict and COVID-19 make the humanitarian impacts very serious. The increasing violence and insecurity in the region, large-scale population displacements due to active hostilities with deteriorating socio-political and armed conflicts, climate change and the sanitary crisis.”, NUMBER OF FOOD INSECURE PEOPLE CONTINUES TO RISE, In 2022, over 61 million people were already projected to require assistance and protection in the West and Central Africa region. The number of food insecure people has been on the rise there, with more than 22 million people food insecure, and 2021 saw a drastic increase in humanitarian needs in the Central Sahel., On the other side of the continent, more than 20 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia are in urgent need of food and water. Millions of families’ harvests have failed, while thousands of their livestock - which pastoral families rely upon for sustenance and livelihoods - are emaciated or dead., In East Africa, food prices have for many months been rising in drought-affected areas, due to a combination of macro-economic challenges and below-average harvests, leaving families unable to afford even basic items. Meanwhile, many water points are dry, forcing women and girls to walk longer distances to access water and increasing the risk that they may face gender-based violence., ADDITIONAL RISKS FOR GIRLS DURING CRISES, The impacts of escalating crises on children and girls, particularly, are disastrous. Gender norms and entrenched gender inequalities mean girls and young women often eat less and last when food is scarce, and their nutritional needs may take a back seat to those of boys and men. When food is scarce, families increasingly resort to negative coping mechanisms to survive. For adolescent girls, this often means that the risk of child, early and forced marriage - and with it, their risk of early pregnancy increases., Plan International welcomes the massive and rapid support for the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, and advocates that a food security and nutrition crises in Ukraine and refugee-receiving countries be avoided. All humanitarian funds to alleviate the suffering of people affected by this conflict must be additional, and must not at any time be diverted from already scarce financing for existing crises., Coppens points out that diverting funds will increase the humanitarian funding gap even further., “The humanitarian crisis unfolding in Ukraine and neighbouring countries is having a devastating impact on children, and it is vital we respond,” he says. “At the same time, we must ensure that we continue to support children in other critical and underfunded humanitarian crises taking place globally.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-will-have-catastrophic-impact-global-hunger

(Source: FTS), KEY HIGHLIGHTS, Urban areas across certain parts of Ukraine have been facing more than a week of relentless shelling that continues to damage and disrupt the functioning of critical civilian infrastructure, leaving thousands without water, heating, or electricity. Shelling and overall violence are also creating critical shortages of food and medicine and preventing the delivery of life-saving supplies and the evacuation of the most vulnerable., As the geographic reach of the conflict continues to expand every day, new areas outside the traditional hotbeds in eastern Ukraine and major urban centres are increasingly being affected, a worrying trend that could contribute to a significant expansion in the scope and scale of the humanitarian crisis., In the early hours of 4 March, reports emerged that a fire had broken out at a training centre at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – the largest of its kind in the country – located in south-eastern Ukraine as clashes in the surrounding area of Enerhodar raged on. The fire has since been extinguished and preliminary reports suggest that the plant has not sustained any critical damage to essential equipment, with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) saying that there has not been a change in the radiation levels., The number of civilian causalities continues to mount with each passing hour. Between 24 February and 3 March, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports at least 1,006 civilian casualties, including 331 killed, a figure that is likely much higher as civilian deaths and injuries continue to be verified., The UN and its humanitarian partners continue to scale up their operations and consider the establishment of new offices and sub-offices across the country, preparing to respond to the increased level of humanitarian needs. Several international humanitarian organizations have already been able to deliver large amounts of assistance either to neighbouring countries or inside Ukraine. The level of humanitarian response is expected to continue growing in the coming days and weeks., SITUATION OVERVIEW, On 3 March, the latest talks between the Russian Federation and Ukraine reportedly resulted in a joint commitment to establish humanitarian corridors for the safe passage of civilians from and humanitarian relief supplies to the worstaffected areas. This is potentially a key development in the ongoing humanitarian response across Ukraine, as a growing number of Ukrainian cities come under a relentless siege that is driving an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the country. The most urgent needs are reported in Dnipro (central), Donetsk (east), Kharkiv (east), Kherson (south), Kyiv (capital), Luhansk (east) and Mariupol (south-east) – home to more than 7.3 million people combined., Many cities across certain parts of Ukraine have been facing a week of persistent shelling that continues to damage or disrupt functioning of civilian infrastructure, leaving thousands without water, heating or electricity, creating critical shortages of food and medicine. This is also preventing the delivery of life-saving supplies and the evacuation of the most vulnerable, including children, women, the elderly and people living with disabilities, as roads and bridges as well as trains and railway stations have been significantly damaged or destroyed., The number of civilian causalities continues to mount with each passing hour. Between 4 a.m. on 24 February and midnight on 3 March, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports at least 1,006 civilian casualties, including 331 killed, a figure that is likely much higher as civilian deaths and injuries continue to be verified. OHCHR reports 440 casualties in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts (54 killed and 277 injured in Government-controlled areas and 23 killed and 86 injured in non-Government-controlled areas) and 566 civilian casualties in other regions of Ukraine., As the geographic reach of the conflict continues to expand every day, new areas situated outside the traditional hotbeds in eastern Ukraine and major urban centres are increasingly being affected, a worrying trend that could contribute to a significant expansion in the scope and scale of the crisis. On 3 March, the northern city of Cherniv – home to around 285,000 inhabitants – more than two dozen people were reportedly killed and nearly 20 others injured after strikes hit a civilian apartment complex., In the early hours of 4 March, reports emerged of a fire had broken out at a training centre at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – the largest of its kind in the country – located in south-eastern Ukraine as clashes in the surrounding area of Enerhodar raged on. The fire has since been extinguished and preliminary reports suggest that the plant has not sustained any critical damage to essential equipment, with the IAEA saying that there has not been a change in the radiation levels at the power plant, which is home to six of the country’s 15 nuclear energy reactors. The incident served as an ominous reminder of the potential environmental health catastrophe that the ongoing conflict could produce, potentially releasing large amounts of radioactivity in the worst-case scenario., Amid escalating violence, internal and cross-border displacement continues unabated across certain parts of Ukraine, driving a corresponding growth in humanitarian needs that has already reached crisis levels after just over a week., While the scale and scope of displacement are not yet clear, it is estimated that more than 10 million people could potentially flee their homes amid the current crisis, including a staggering 4 million people who may cross international borders, a figure that has already surpassed one million since 24 February. As the scale of displacement increases, the most vulnerable groups, including women and children, people living with disabilities, third-country migrants and older persons, among others, will face heightened protection risks, such as abuse and neglect as well as sexual and genderbased violence.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-4-march-2022
How MSF is responding to the crisis in Ukraine,News and Press Release,MSF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",4 Mar 2022,"This article was published on March 4, 2022, and is being regularly updated., On February 24, Russia launched a large-scale military operation in Ukraine that rapidly escalated into a war across most of the country. Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is stepping up its medical humanitarian response to the deepening humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and in neighboring countries, where more than 4.1 million refugees have fled., MSF has a longstanding presence in Ukraine, including in parts of the eastern region that have been affected by armed conflict since 2014. Due to the current war, we have halted normal activities and have started emergency activities in Ukraine. We also have teams in Poland, Moldova, Hungary, Slovakia, Russia, and Belarus. MSF is an independent and impartial organization committed to providing medical humanitarian assistance to people affected by the war no matter who they are or where they are., MSF staff in Ukraine are assessing humanitarian needs, delivering urgent medical supplies, providing training to hospitals on how to manage mass casualty incidents, and preparing to expand activities. On March 6, MSF's first shipment of emergency medical supplies was delivered to the Ukrainian Ministry of Health in Kyiv, and subsequent shipments have arrived since then. We supply surgical kits, trauma kits, and other basic necessities, including for hospitals in areas farther east where they are especially needed., We are working with medical facilities in many parts of the country to help meet current needs and prepare for what might come next. Just before the war began in late February, MSF surgeons with experience in war zones provided training remotely to surgeons in key hospitals in eastern Ukraine that have since received many wounded people. On March 13 and 14, an MSF surgical team visited the 750-bed Okhmatdyt pediatric hospital in central Kyiv to begin providing training and advice related to trauma surgery and the management of mass casualty events. In Bila Tsverka, about 50 miles south of Kyiv, an MSF team is leading a two-day training on managing mass casualties and donating supplies to health facilities in the region. In Vinnytsia Oblast, we are working with local hospitals to help them prepare for mass casualties, exploring how we can provide water and sanitation support, and making donations of medical supplies. In Nemyriv district, we have started supporting psychological care for people with mental health conditions and are planning to support physiotherapy for war-wounded patients., In the southern cities of Odesa and Mykolaiv, we have donated medical supplies to hospitals preparing to accept wounded. In Chernihiv, northern Ukraine, we provided medical supplies to a regional hospital and a maternity hospital. In Kharkiv, northeastern Ukraine, we are preparing to begin running mobile clinics in subway stations where people are sheltering. In Lviv, in western Ukraine, we have provided mass casualty training and helped hospitals to prepare for mass influxes of wounded., An urgent need for medical supplies, So far the most urgently needed supplies are surgical, trauma, emergency room (ER), and intensive care unit (ICU) equipment and drugs. But a broader picture of other key medical items is coming into focus as the conflict continues, including insulin for diabetes patients and medicines for patients with other chronic diseases such as asthma, hypertension, or HIV. Transportation of some of these essential supplies will require the added complexity of a cold chain. We are exploring more ways to safely move medical supplies within the country., Caring for displaced people, Many displaced people are now sheltering in Lviv and other towns in western Ukraine. Many have have left their homes with only what they could carry. Local volunteers and civil society organizations are working hard to help them, but conditions are harsh, with available accommodations already past capacity and temperatures falling below freezing at night. MSF will be donating a large supply of cold weather items including sleeping bags, warm clothes, and tents to civil society organizations supporting displaced people. We are also assessing how we can provide medical support, particularly in Vinnytsia, where many routes criss-crossing Ukraine converge. Here MSF is looking into launching mobile clinics to provide basic medical care to displaced people., A large part of our work in Ukraine from 2014 to 2021 was responding to the needs of patients with HIV, tuberculosis, or other chronic illnesses. We are now shifting to provide support in the context of wider war. An important focus for the MSF teams is to ensure that we are able to provide the right medical supplies to the right hospitals at the right time, based on their needs and the challenges they are facing., Eastern Ukraine, The humanitarian crisis in Mariupol is growing more and more desperate. The city in southeastern Ukraine remains surrounded by Russian military forces and subject to repeated artillery and aerial bombardment. Residents shelter in basements. Shops are closed. Food and clean water are difficult to find. Pharmacies have run out of medicines. People are lying dead in the streets. Gas and electricity have been off for days, in sub-zero temperatures. People are making fires to cook food and keep warm. Many attempts at establishing a ceasefire to allow safe passage for those who wish to leave the city have failed, though one convoy was allowed to leave the city on March 14. Civilian and medical infrastructure has been damaged, and communication is extremely limited. An MSF staff member from Mariupol [shared his personal story](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/ukraine-one-long-nightmare-mariupol ""Ukraine: ""One long nightmare"" in Mariupol"") of surviving under intense bombardment and being forced to flee., MSF is calling for safe passage for those willing and able to escape across war-affected areas inside Ukraine, regardless of the existence of humanitarian corridors or temporary ceasefires. People who stay behind must not lose their civilian status: Warring parties must do everything in their power to prevent harm to civilians at all times, in all places., On March 9, MSF issued a statement in response to horrific reports that a hospital complex in Mariupol was struck in an attack. Attacks on health structures destroy what little capacity is left to treat urgent cases. In a city, where the health system is close to collapse, depriving people of much-needed health care is a violation of the laws of war., On March 12, an MSF staff member still trapped in the besieged city described an increasingly desperate situation. ""We saw people who died because of lack of medication ... and many people who were killed and injured."" In an interview with CNN, emergency coordinator Alex Wade described the crisis in Mariupol as a matter of ""urgency of the highest level."", In Dnipro, we have donated medical supplies to local health facilities and are currently assessing the needs in the area. And in Kramatorsk, we donated supplies to seven hospitals with the highest needs., Western Ukraine, In Lviv, teams have donated medical supplies to health facilities and are providing mass casualty training to hospital staff., In and around Zhytomyr we have donated trauma-related supplies and conducted similar mass casualty training in six hospitals. We have also been able to move a considerable part of our tuberculosis (TB) supplies from Kyiv to Zhytomyr, where we were previously running a TB program., We also provided the main referral hospital in Mukachevo, near the Hungarian border, with a mass casualty training., Moldova, More than 387,000 people have crossed into Moldova from Ukraine since the war began. Moldova, which has a population of just 2.6 million people, now hosts the largest concentration of Ukrainian refugees per capita, according to the UN Refugee Agency (the source of refugee figures used on page)., At the Palanca border crossing, an MSF team is supporting Moldovan health staff on site and offering psychological first aid to refugees escaping the fighting in southern Ukraine. We also set up a health post near the border crossing in Otaci this week, offering similar services. Our teams in the capital, Chișinău, have provided psychological first aid to people in reception centers and are evaluating how to improve access to health care for refugees in hospitals., Poland, More than 2.3 million people have fled Ukraine to Poland so far. MSF initially donated non-food items to the Red Cross Lublin and to a reception point in Horodlo, near the Zosin border crossing. Our staff in Poland have assessed needs at border crossings, transit centers, and train stations, and are also supporting our emergency response in Ukraine., Hungary, As of March 29, nearly 365,000 people having crossed as refugees into Hungary. While our initial assessments indicated that many of the immediate needs of refugees are being met, we have started working with the support of Hungarian doctors, in partnership with local organizations, to provide primary health care and psychological first aid., Slovakia, More than 280,000 people have crossed into Slovakia from Ukraine as of March 29. An MSF emergency team arrived in the country at the beginning of March to assess the medical and humanitarian needs. We have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of Health in order to import medical supplies and enable our possible work in the future. For the moment, critical medical and humanitarian needs in Slovakia are being met by local authorities and civil society groups., Russia, MSF works with the health authorities in Arkhangelsk and Vladimir regions to reduce the burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) and improve treatment for the disease. More than 350,000 people have crossed to Russia from Ukraine as of March 29. MSF is currently exploring whether new medical humanitarian needs have emerged in border regions. Our team has visited Rostov and Voronezh and is heading to Belgorod. In Rostov, we donated food, hygiene kits, essential relief items and medicines to be distributed among displaced people., Belarus, MSF continues to run its regular programs in Belarus, supporting the national tuberculosis program and hepatitis C treatment in prisons. Since 2021 we have also assisted people on the move stranded between Belarus and the European Union countries. MSF has carried out an initial assessment of the situation on the border with Ukraine and stands ready to assist with emerging medical and humanitarian needs. As of March 29, about 5,000 people have crossed into Belarus from Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/how-msf-responding-crisis-ukraine
"Ukraine: ""The risk of major conflict is real and needs to be prevented at all costs""",News and Press Release,UN DPPA,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",4 Mar 2022,"Mr. President,, It is with great concern and sadness that I brief the Council this evening on the unfolding dangerous situation in and around Ukraine., In his statement today, the Secretary-General was clear: He considers the decision of the Russian Federation to recognize the independence of certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions to be a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We very much regret this decision, which risks having regional and global repercussions., We also regret the order today to deploy Russian troops into eastern Ukraine, reportedly on a “peacekeeping mission”., These developments follow the decision to order a mass evacuation of civilian residents of Donetsk and Luhansk into the Russian Federation., We are concerned by the escalating shelling across the contact line, reportedly leading to a number of casualties. OSCE’s Special Monitoring Mission has recorded a total of 3,231 ceasefire violations in the Donbas area from 18-20 February: 1,073 ceasefire violations, including 926 explosions in the Luhansk region, and 2,158 ceasefire violations, including 1,100 explosions, in Donetsk region., We remind all involved of their responsibilities under international humanitarian law and human rights law., Although the United Nations is not in a position to verify the numerous claims and allegations made by various actors, we are deeply concerned about the reports of civilian casualties, targeting of critical civilian infrastructure, and ongoing evacuations., Mr. President,, We are extremely concerned about the possible implications of the latest developments for the existing negotiation frameworks. Amid the current risks and uncertainty, it is even more important to pursue dialogue., Negotiation is the only way to address the existing differences among the key actors regarding regional security issues, and the settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine in accordance with Security Council resolution 2202 (2015)., Before the current, already dangerous conditions escalate further, we call on all relevant actors to focus their efforts on an immediate cessation of hostilities. Civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected, and actions and statements that may worsen the situation must be avoided., Over the past few weeks, key actors have been engaged in intense diplomatic efforts to avert a new eruption of conflict in the heart of Europe. The Secretary-General fully supports these efforts and has deplored even the possibility that a new conflict could break out., Mr. President,, We are committed to our long-term partnership with Ukraine – a founding member of the United Nations – as it continues to pursue the democratic reform agenda 30 years after independence., And once again we reiterate the full commitment of the United Nations to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders, in accordance with General Assembly resolutions., Throughout the eight years of conflict in eastern Ukraine, the United Nations has continued to provide life-saving humanitarian support to all in need as well as human rights-related work. During this difficult period, we are committed to stay and deliver and remain fully operational in Ukraine, including in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The safety and security of all our staff must be respected by all parties., Mr. President,, The next hours and days will be critical. The risk of major conflict is real and needs to be prevented at all costs. I can assure you of the full commitment of the Secretary-General to work toward a diplomatic resolution of the current crisis., Thank you, Mr. President",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-risk-major-conflict-real-and-needs-be-prevented-all-costs
"Fighting at Ukraine Nuclear Power Site Irresponsible, against Geneva Conventions, Under-Secretary-General Tells Security Council",News and Press Release,UN SC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",4 Mar 2022,"SECURITY COUNCIL
8986TH MEETING* (AM)
SC14819
4 MARCH 2022, Delegate Calls on Russian Federation to Protect Civilians, Stresses That International Humanitarian Law Is Not Optional, Fierce overnight fighting at Ukraine’s largest nuclear power facility — which resulted in a fire, but has not elevated radiation levels — is both unacceptable and “highly irresponsible”, the senior United Nations political affairs official told an emergency meeting of the Security Council today., Rosemary Dicarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, was joined by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, who detailed events over the last 24 hours and expressed his readiness to immediately deploy a non-political nuclear‑safety mission to Ukraine., “Ukraine knows only too well the devastation a major nuclear accident can cause,” Ms. DiCarlo told the Security Council, referring to the devastating 1986 nuclear incident in the town of Chernobyl. Describing fighting at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in the town of Enerhodar in recent hours, she said heavy shelling there affected a training facility, and not the plant’s cooling system or power centre. Nevertheless, developments at the site are not only unacceptable, but also “highly irresponsible”, she stressed, recalling that attacks on nuclear power facilities run counter to article 56 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions., Mr. Grossi, addressing the Council remotely from onboard an aircraft, said IAEA has been in regular contact with Ukrainian nuclear regulatory officials. They reported that Russian Federation troops moving into the area of Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station were met with opposition by Ukrainian civilians, but in recent hours a projectile hit a building near the power plant’s nuclear reactors, resulting in a fire that was then extinguished. No safety systems were compromised, and no nuclear reactors were hit. While the plant’s operations continue normally, he emphasized that “there is no normalcy about this situation when there are military forces in charge of the site”., Against that fraught backdrop, he said IAEA is prepared to travel to Ukraine as soon as possible, with the goal of establishing a framework to ensure that the safety and integrity of all nuclear facilities can be observed. “This mission of the IAEA, if and when it takes place, should not have anything to do with the political and diplomatic aspects that are in the purview of the Security Council,” he said, emphasizing that such a mission would be strictly restricted to the safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine., As Council members took the floor, many sounded alarm over the events unfolding in and around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station, as well as in Ukraine more broadly. Several emphasized that an accident or incident at the nuclear facility — which is Europe’s largest — would have unimaginable consequences for human and planetary health, and wreak havoc far greater than that witnessed in Chernobyl in 1986. Nearly every speaker called for an immediate de‑escalation, with many urging the Russian Federation to promptly withdraw all its troops and weapons from the territory of Ukraine., Norway’s representative said shelling and fighting in the immediate vicinity of a civilian nuclear power plant shows a blatant disregard for Ukrainian lives, Russian lives and indeed life in Europe and beyond. Stressing that international humanitarian law is not optional, she called on Moscow to fulfil its obligations to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure. It must immediately withdraw its forces from Ukrainian territory and cease all threats and military actions, including in the vicinity of, and directed at, nuclear facilities, she said, adding: “A ceasefire is desperately and urgently needed; diplomacy must win.”, The representative of the United Kingdom, one of the delegations who called for today’s emergency session, said today marks the first time that a State has attacked a fuelled, functioning nuclear power plant. International law mandates special protection for nuclear facilities, and it is difficult to see how Moscow’s actions are compatible with its commitments thereunder. This must not happen again, and even amid its illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Federation must keep the fighting away from — and protect the safety and security of — nuclear sites, she stressed., Ghana’s representative emphasized that every effort must be made to mitigate the risk of accidental emissions, which pose immeasurable risk to the lives of civilians and an already fragile environment. Support must continue for IAEA to enable it to provide necessary assistance to Ukrainian authorities to ensure the safety of nuclear facilities and infrastructure together with all staff on site, she said, recalling the horrors of the 1986 Chernobyl accident and the consequent nuclear catastrophe., The representative of Brazil, echoing calls on all parties to refrain from any action that could jeopardize the security of nuclear material, declared: “We cannot turn a blind eye to the role that the Council should play, but is not playing, in the current situation.” No matter how many public meetings the Council convenes, it seems a ceasefire and an end to the hostilities remain elusive. Urging all members to promote dialogue and rebuild trust, he stressed: “This is not the time to further escalate the rhetoric, but to engage in conversations towards peace.”, Meanwhile, the representatives of the Russian Federation and Ukraine outlined opposing narratives of the events that unfolded over the last 24 hours. Moscow’s representative said the Zaporizhzhia power plant was in fact taken by Russian forces on 28 February and placed under the guard of the Russian military, with the goal of preventing Ukrainian forces or others from creating a nuclear provocation or interrupting the power supply to civilians. On the night of 4 March, however, Ukrainian saboteurs fired upon Russian forces who were patrolling the area and set a fire, which was quickly extinguished. No personnel were injured, the power units at Zaporizhzhia were not damaged and the facility continues to operate normally., Describing today’s meeting as yet another attempt by the Kyiv authorities to create “artificial hysteria” about the events taking place in Ukraine, he declared: “A massive anti-Russia information campaign is unfolding.” Moscow has no interest in seeking a nuclear provocation of any kind, having also lived through the 1986 Chernobyl incident. The Council’s reaction today only proves that Ukrainian saboteurs enjoy “carte blanche” for their actions from the international community, he said., Ukraine’s representative, strongly rejecting that description of events, said that, on 3 March the Russian Federation committed an act of nuclear terrorism by shelling the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station. Expressing alarm that the power plant is now under the control of Russian forces — and that several employees responsible for the safe functioning of the site have been killed — he said that, while radiation levels remain normal, Ukrainian nuclear regulators have not been granted access to the site. Any disruption to the cooling process could have irreparable environmental and human consequences for the entire region, he warned., “Russia seems to be furious that its plans to quickly invade Ukraine have already failed,” he said, noting that the Ukrainian people continue to courageously fight for their freedom with broad support from the global community. Noting Moscow’s attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure over the last week, he reminded the Council of its responsibly vis-á-vis a no-fly zone, requesting it to consider the protection of nuclear power plants and urging it to urgently invoke a ban on all flights over Ukraine. He described the Council’s failure to act as an enormous derogation of its responsibility, urging international entities to expel the Russian Federation’s representatives, “as they do not deserve to be among civilized and responsible nations”., Also speaking today were the representatives of Albania, United States, France, Ireland, India, Mexico, China, Kenya and the United Arab Emirates., The meeting began at 11:37 a.m. and ended at 1:20 p.m., Briefings, ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, reported that Ukraine’s cities today remain under heavy assault by Russian forces and over 1 million people have already fled across the country’s borders, and been welcomed by their European neighbours. Those that remain in Ukraine are suffering heavy bombardments and shelling. There have been thousands of casualties and the numbers are growing., Noting that the United Nations is rapidly expanding its work to respond to the crisis, she went on to report heavy fighting at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant overnight. It is the United Nations understanding that the shelling at the site affected a training facility, and not the cooling system or power centre. Describing the actions that took place in recent hours as highly irresponsible, she recalled the 1986 nuclear disaster in the Ukrainian town of Chernobyl, adding: “Ukraine knows only too well the devastation a major nuclear accident can cause.”, “Every effort should be taken to prevent a catastrophic nuclear incident,” she continued, applauding the brave personnel who have kept Ukrainian nuclear power sites safe during the current crisis. She recalled that attacks on nuclear power facilities run counter to international humanitarian law, specifically, Article 56 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions. The Secretary‑General welcomes the statements and actions by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) this morning, and is ready to assist however he can., Urging all parties to work with the Agency to promptly create a framework to ensure the safe and reliable operation of all the country’s nuclear power plants, she also welcomed the reported agreement between Ukrainian and Russian negotiations during their second round of talks on 3 March, including on the creation of a humanitarian corridor and safe passage for civilians. Expressing her hope that a ceasefire will also be agreed shortly, she emphasized that only diplomacy can end this crisis, stressing: “The fighting must stop, and it must stop now.”, RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said his organization has been in regular contact with its Ukrainian nuclear regulatory counterpart. Last week, it was confirmed that Russian Federation forces had taken control of the Chernobyl nuclear site, and that operators there continued to run day-to-day operations. Several days ago, IAEA was informed by the Russian Federation that its forces are moving into the area of Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. They were met with opposition by Ukrainian civilians, but in recent hours a projectile reportedly hit a building near the power plant’s nuclear reactors, resulting in a fire that was then extinguished. No safety systems have been compromised and no nuclear reactors themselves were hit., While the plant’s operations continue normally, he emphasized that “there is no normalcy about this situation when there are military forces in charge of the site”. IAEA continues its regular contact with the Ukrainian regulatory agency, as well as the company that runs the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, and operators there. Stressing his readiness to travel to Chernobyl as soon as possible to consult with Ukrainian counterparts, and if necessary, with the forces in charge, he said the goal is to establish a framework to ensure that the safety and integrity of all facilities can be observed., Having received direct request for assistance, he said it is IAEA’s responsibility to heed that call and provide help. “This mission of the IAEA, if and when it takes place, should not have anything to do with the political and diplomatic aspects that are in the purview of the Security Council,” he said, emphasizing that such a mission would be strictly restricted to the safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine., Statements, BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom), noting that her country and its partners called today’s urgent meeting because Russian Federation forces attacked the largest nuclear power station in Europe, underscored that this is the first time that a State has attacked a fuelled, functioning nuclear power plant. International law mandates special protection for nuclear facilities, and it is difficult to see how Moscow’s actions are compatible with its commitments thereunder. This must not happen again and, even amid its illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Federation must keep the fighting away from — and protect the safety and security of — nuclear sites. Recalling Russian President Vladimir V. Putin’s statement on 3 March that the “special military operation” — “or, as everyone else calls it, a war” — is going to plan, she said that he misjudged the strength, resilience and will of the Ukrainian people to his invasion. Mr. Putin also underestimated the world’s condemnation of his actions, as 141 votes in the General Assembly and unprecedented sanctions on his country attest. Against that backdrop, she called on the Russian Federation to end the violence, withdraw its troops and enter serious peace negotiations., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said that, 10 days into the so-called special operation — which, in reality, is “Operation How to Invade Your Neighbour” — the humanitarian crisis heading towards disaster in Ukraine has implications for all of Europe. All developments in this geopolitical crisis artificially created by the Russian invasion of Ukraine indicate, unmistakeably, that it is headed towards further escalation. The world’s call to stop this aggression has not been heard in Moscow, and the Russian Federation remains defiant. Expressing concern over the Russian capture of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant — which provides more than one fifth of Ukraine’s electricity — he stressed that this could have a serious impact on the country’s civilians and economy, along with irreparable consequences for Europe’s environment. “It is difficult not to have in mind the dreadful images of Chernobyl,” he added. He urged IAEA to continue working closely with Ukraine to provide the maximum assistance possible as that country works to ensure nuclear safety. Further, the Zaporizhzhia plant must be operated by its regular staff. He went on to underscore that it falls upon the Council to do what it can — and what is needed — to save Ukraine, its people and all of Europe “from the hell Russia is heading towards with its relentless aggression”., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said the Russian Federation’s attack on 3 March put Europe’s largest nuclear power plant at grave risk, calling it “incredibly reckless and dangerous”. Noting the threat to the safety of civilians across the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Europe, she called on Moscow to withdraw its troops from the plant, permit medical treatment for injured personnel, ensure operators have full access to the site and are able to communicate with nuclear regulators, and to allow operators to conduct shift changes to ensure the continued safe operation of the facility. Ukrainian and nuclear engineers must have full access to the site, she said, stressing that “nuclear facilities cannot become part of this conflict.” The Russian Federation must halt any further use of force that might put at further risk all 15 operable reactors across Ukraine or interfere with that country’s ability to maintain the safety and security of its 37 nuclear facilities and surrounding populations, she said. Expressing serious concern that Russian military forces controlling the Chernobyl site have not permitted operators there to have a shift change since last week, she called on all countries to support Mr. Grossi in his efforts to find arrangements going forward to ensure nuclear safety and prevent a nuclear catastrophe in Ukraine., Detailing the impacts of the Russian Federation’s invasion, she said the United Nations has reported that the action has turned half a million children into refugees. Further, she said the invasion has killed thousands of Ukrainians, sacrificed the lives of Russian Federation soldiers and destroyed critical infrastructure. Urging her Russian counterparts to provide answers to the Council, she called on Moscow to withdraw its troops and weaponry from Ukraine, and to respect that country’s borders, its people and the Charter. Further urging the Russian Federation to abide by its international law obligations, she said the United States and its partners have called for a briefing on 7 March on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. The international community must be unanimous in demanding the Russian Federation’s forces stop its dangerous assault. “The people of Ukraine are counting on us and we must not let them down,” she concluded., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), condemning the Russian Federation’s attack on the nuclear power plant, called on it to cease its illegal and dangerous activities, so that control over all nuclear materials and facilities within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders can be restored to the country’s authorities. Further, the Russian Federation should also allow regular and unfettered access to the facilities so that operators can carry out their job safely. He asked Mr. Rossi to use all instruments available to IAEA to support Ukraine’s efforts to ensure the safety and security of all facilities in the country, adding that France also supports the Director General’s proposal for negotiations on commitments between the parties to the conflict. He reiterated France’s unwavering support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its own internationally recognized borders. Noting the devastating human cost of the Russian aggression, he said the immediate cessation of hostilities and strict application of international humanitarian law is urgent. For that reason, France, together with Mexico, is putting forth a resolution with that goal in mind, he said, stressing that the Security Council must fully assume its responsibility in that regard., GERALDINE BYRNE NASON (Ireland) said that the 3 March attack by Russian Federation forces on the nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia has shocked everyone and sent a chilling signal across Europe and the globe. It reinforces the concerns arising from the armed takeover by the Russian Federation of the nuclear facilities in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone on 24 February. Ireland condemns the reckless firing against nuclear power plants. Armed attacks and threats against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitute violations of international law, including the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions and the IAEA Statute. By attacking such sites, Moscow risks an environmental disaster, compounding the human tragedy in Ukraine. “A radioactive release from any of these sites would also have serious repercussions for human life and health, agriculture and the environment in Ukraine, the Russian Federation itself and the wider European region,” she said. She called on the Russian Federation to fully respect its obligations under the Charter, international law and the IAEA Statue. All international nuclear safety and security standards must be maintained. She called on the Russian Federation to allow Ukrainian personnel at the plant do their work, safely and without undue pressure. It is crucial that safety systems at the plant are not compromised. Power supply to the plant must be maintained. This is essential not just for the six reactors at this site, but also for the spent fuel stored there. There should be no interruption of basic services, including energy to the population across Ukraine at this time. Ireland fully supports the work of IAEA, and its incident and emergency centre in its ongoing monitoring and assistance of the nuclear safety and security situation in Ukraine. It will be for the IAEA Director General to keep the Council informed regarding nuclear safety and security in Ukraine. “Cavalier, reckless behaviour with dangerous forces such as nuclear power is utterly unacceptable,” she said., MONA JUUL (Norway) said shelling and fighting in the immediate vicinity of a civilian nuclear power plant shows a blatant disregard for Ukrainian lives, Russian lives and indeed life in Europe and beyond. It is irresponsible and unacceptable, as civilians can never be a target and a nuclear power plant should never be a target. International humanitarian law is not optional, she said, calling on the Russian Federation to fulfil its obligations to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure. Commending efforts to ensure continuing nuclear safety and security, she said the Russian Federation bears full responsibility for this act of aggression, and all the destruction and loss of life it has and will continue to cause. Reiterating the call for on Moscow to immediately withdraw its forces from Ukrainian territory and cease all threats and military actions, including in the vicinity of, and directed at, nuclear facilities, she said: “A ceasefire is desperately and urgently needed; diplomacy must win.”, VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said today’s meeting is yet another attempt by the Kyiv authorities to create “artificial hysteria” about the events taking place in Ukraine, backed by their Western allies. Lies are being told about how Russian Federation troops attacked the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Enerhodar, part of a broader campaign of lies against Moscow. “These statements are simply untrue,” he said, noting that the power plant and adjacent territory were taken by the Russian Federation’s forces on 28 February. An agreement was reached at that time to place the facilities under the guard of the Russian military, with the goal of preventing Ukrainian forces or other groups from taking advantage of the events to create a nuclear provocation or interrupt power supply to civilians. The Russian Federation has brought in personnel with relevant technical experience, and the situation is currently similar in Chernobyl, where security is being ensured jointly by the Ukrainian operators and the Russian forces., On the night of 4 March, he said, while patrolling the area adjacent to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, a Russian military patrol was attacked by a group of Ukrainian saboteurs. Heavy small arms fire was opened from several floors of the training complex located just outside the nuclear power plant. Russian troops returned fire, and the Ukrainian saboteurs set a fire as they were leaving, which was quickly extinguished. At present, the power plant’s personnel — who were not injured — continue to work normally, and are monitoring radiation levels, which remain normal. Noting that the power units of the Zaporizhzhia facility were not damaged, he went on to recall similar attempts at nuclear provocations by Ukrainian nationalists in 2014. Moscow drew attention to those efforts at the time, but was ignored., “A massive anti-Russia information campaign is unfolding,” he stressed, asking why Moscow would seek a nuclear provocation of any kind. He emphasized that the danger to the Ukrainian population today comes not from Moscow, but from groups of Ukrainian saboteurs. The Council’s reaction only proves that those saboteurs enjoy “carte blanche” for their actions from the international community. Outlining the challenging situation faced by foreign nationals in Ukraine, he said Russian forces have established checkpoints equipped with medication and hot meals, and evacuees are being assisted. He also cited reports of requisitioning of United Nations vehicles by Ukrainian nationalists, voicing grave concern they could end up in terrorist hands and could be used for terrorist purposes., T.S. TIRUMURTI (India), emphasizing that a cessation of hostilities is essential, said his delegation attaches the highest importance to ensuring safety and security of nuclear facilities. Any accident involving the nuclear facilities may have severe consequences for public health and the environment, he said, adding that India accords the highest priority to the discharge by IAEA of its safeguards and monitoring activities, in accordance with its Statute in an effective, non-discriminatory and efficient manner. Expressing hope that talks between the two sides contribute to the immediate establishment of a safe humanitarian corridor, he said differences must be resolved through sustained dialogue and diplomacy, as reiterated by India’s Prime Minister in his conversations with global leaders including of the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Key principles in this regard are a commitment to the United Nations Charter and international law and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico), expressing concern over the incident at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station, said that, while the information presented would indicate that nuclear reactors have not been impacted and radiation levels have not increased, this does not diminish the gravity of the incident. Firing missiles on or around a nuclear energy plant is a violation of fundamental principles governing the physical integrity of such facilities, which must be maintained under all circumstances. Also expressing concern for the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, he stressed that any incident at either of these facilities — or at any other — could have serious health and environmental repercussions. Just a week into a conflict that has already created more than 1 million refugees, the additional humanitarian consequences of a radiological accident would be so serious that the Council must take all preventative measures within its reach to avert the same. There is no justification for military action at these sites, and the Zaporizhzhia incident should be added to a growing list of direct and collateral attacks on civilian infrastructure. He went on to call for an immediate ceasefire to facilitate urgent humanitarian action., CAROLYN OPPONG-NTIRI (Ghana) said every effort must be made to mitigate the risk of accidental emissions, which pose immeasurable risk to the lives of civilians and an already fragile environment. Support must continue for IAEA to enable it to provide necessary assistance to Ukrainian authorities to ensure the safety of nuclear facilities and infrastructure together with all staff on site, she said, recalling the horrors of the 1986 Chernobyl accident and the consequent nuclear catastrophe. Ghana strongly appeals to the parties to exercise restraint and halt the use of force in all areas of critical infrastructure, including the nuclear power plants, and to respect their international obligations to protect human lives and to prevent a potential disaster. Noting ongoing diplomatic talks in Belarus, she welcomed the agreement reached to create a humanitarian corridor. Expressing strong support for the peaceful resolution of this conflict, she urged further constructive engagements by the parties at all levels in the pursuit of their security interests and the maintenance of international peace and security., ZHANG JUN (China), expressing concern over relevant reports regarding the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station, noted that, according to the information IAEA received from the Ukrainian nuclear authorities, the plant’s main equipment remains intact and the level of radiation unchanged. China attaches great importance to nuclear safety and security, and he expressed hope that the relevant parties act with caution and — with specialized assistance from IAEA — work to ensure the safety of relevant nuclear facilities in Ukraine. The crisis in Ukraine is undergoing complex changes, but it is most important to ease tensions, avoid more civilian casualties, intensify diplomatic efforts and return to the track of political settlement as soon as possible. Welcoming the recent, preliminary consensus on establishing a humanitarian corridor, he expressed hope that the same will help protect civilians and assist the evacuation of foreign nationals, including China’s. The international community should remain cool‑headed and rational, adopting a responsible, objective and impartial approach to facilitating direct talks between the parties concerned. Any action must work towards diplomatic settlement, he stressed, “rather than adding fuel to the fire”., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) said the international community is not only witnessing an appalling humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine, but is also confronted with the prospect of a nuclear incident of significant dimensions due to the situation in the nuclear facility in Zaporizhzhia. That is yet another reason for the international community to call for the immediate and comprehensive cessation of all hostilities in Ukraine, he said. The complete de-escalation of military actions is past due, and the provisions of international humanitarian law must be respected in their entirety. He called on all parties to refrain from any measure or action that could jeopardize the security of nuclear material, as well as the safe operation of all nuclear facilities in Ukraine. “We cannot turn a blind eye to the role that the Council should play, but is not playing in the current situation,” he said, adding that, no matter how many public meetings the Council convenes, a ceasefire and an end to the hostilities remain elusive. He urged all members to promote dialogue and rebuild trust. “This is not the time to further escalate the rhetoric, but to engage in conversations towards peace,” he said, reiterating his country’s appeal for a ceasefire and diplomacy., JAYNE TOROITICH (Kenya) said rarely has it been more urgent to observe international conventions regulating the conduct of armed conflict. Kenya calls for the adherence to the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), particularly part IV. Article 15 states: “Works or installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations, shall not be made the object of attack, even where these objects are military objectives, if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population.” Kenya also recalls the resolution, adopted in April 2021, on “Protection of Objects Indispensable to the Survival of the Civilian Population”. It highlights the significant effect the destruction of essential infrastructure in many conflicts across the globe continues to have on civilians. Beyond the risk to nuclear power plants, Kenya urges due caution around any actions that may destroy civilian objects critical to the survival of Ukrainians. “Harm to them can lead to an escalation of the armed conflict and make it all the more difficult to resolve it promptly,” she said. Kenya calls for the military leadership of Ukraine and the Russian Federation to establish mechanisms to reduce the targeting and risk to critical infrastructure. Such a mechanism can mirror the agreement, made on 3 March by both sides of the conflict, to establish a humanitarian corridor, as well as a temporary local ceasefire to enable aid deliveries. Kenya encourages the continuation of this positive dialogue and calls on Moscow to urgently enter negotiations to settle this conflict by peaceful means., ..., For information media.

IAEA Director General Grossi’s Initiative to Travel to Ukraine [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,4 Mar 2022,"IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi today announced his readiness to travel to the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) to secure the commitment to the safety and security of all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants from the parties of the conflict in the country., The Director General outlined seven indispensable pillars of nuclear safety and security at a meeting of the IAEA’s Board of Governors on 2 March, convened to address the safety, security and safeguards implications of the situation in Ukraine. Today he warned that several of them had already been put at risk during events overnight at the Zaporizhhzhya NPP, Ukraine’s largest nuclear power plant., The Seven Pillars are:, The Director General said there had been no release of radiation from the Zaporizhhzhya NPP as a result of a fire there that was later extinguished., “But we cannot rely on this good fortune to continue. It is high time to stop an armed conflict from putting nuclear facilities at severe risk, potentially endangering the safety of people and the environment in Ukraine and beyond. Words must mean something - it is time for action.”, The IAEA is the international, authoritative technical nuclear agency capable of providing the adequate technical assistance to help ensure the safe and secure operation of nuclear facilities, he said., But in these conditions, the Director General said the Agency needed a commitment from every actor so that it could provide such technical assistance in Ukraine., “The logistics for this trip will be difficult, but not impossible. What we require is a commitment that allows us to provide this technical assistance,” he said, adding that he was consulting with others on making this come about., Director General Grossi made clear that his proposal had nothing to do with attempting a political resolution to the conflict in Ukraine. “My responsibility is limited to the safety and security of nuclear facilities,” he said. “Let’s get to work.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iaea-director-general-grossi-s-initiative-travel-ukraine-enru
A Sick Baby Clings to Life in a Ukraine Basement,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,4 Mar 2022,"Allow Safe Evacuation of Civilians at Risk, Jonathan Pedneault
Researcher, Crisis and Conflict Division, Oksana’s voice breaks a bit on the phone: “My 11-month-old daughter became ill on the first day of the war.”, Every hour since has been a battle to keep Oksana’s daughter Mariia alive. What began with an intestinal infection has since turned into a medical condition that requires a mechanical valve to pump oxygen into her lungs. Oksana and Mariia are pseudonyms; the mother is too afraid to use their real names., Between the ambulance ride to a hospital in southern Ukraine just over a week ago, to the many sleepless nights worrying about her daughter, Oksana has seen little of the Russian soldiers who took control of their city in recent days., But she has very much felt the impact of the war. She has had to beg for cash from strangers to buy fast-disappearing medicine in pharmacies that no longer take credit cards. And she’s worried that her daughter won’t get the care she needs. Many nurses and doctors are sheltering at home, while others have fled the city. The hospital’s head doctor is unreachable. Everyone is afraid., The doctors who remain haven’t been able to diagnose Mariia. “We could not do an MRI because the private clinic that usually does it is closed,” Oksana tells me., Meanwhile, Mariia’s condition has worsened. She is now on a ventilator, unable to breathe on her own. “Whenever there are sirens, the doctors have to unplug her to go the basement, so they make her breathe manually through manual breathing support,” Oksana explains. Sirens are the only times Oksana get to see her daughter: “I have no access to the intensive care section, so I only see Mariia in the basement.”, The city they are in is now under the effective control of Russian forces, but the air raid sirens haven’t stopped. War continues. So do the trips down to the basement., Both Russia and Ukraine have obligations to ensure access for humanitarian assistance to civilians and take all feasible steps to allow the civilian population to evacuate. The mayor in Oksana’s city has asked for a humanitarian corridor to allow in crucial food and medical supplies and to allow out vulnerable civilians., Whether or not the parties can reach agreement on such a corridor, Mariia’s chances of survival are directly linked to parties respecting their wartime obligations to civilians.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/sick-baby-clings-life-ukraine-basement

Water Sanitation Hygiene",4 Mar 2022,"Children forced from their homes in Ukraine are struggling to cope as Russia’s military operations enter the second week, with Save the Children providing support through local partners to ensure families can get access to medicine as well as to water and dwindling food supplies., Long queues comprising mostly of mothers and young children fill the halls of a Save the Children supported centre for displaced families in eastern Ukraine. Here families can stock up on essentials and find a safe place to sleep before they continue on their journey., “We are supporting more than 1,000 people who fled their homes, about 60% are mothers with small children and pregnant women,” said Nataliia Kirkach, director of Slavic Heart, a Save the Children partner organisation operating in eastern Ukraine., “This area had been generally peaceful before but now we are starting to hear shelling nearby. We didn’t want to abandon the families we are caring for so our staff stayed. Everyone is stressed about their safety, including children.”  , As the conflict intensifies, more and more families are coming to Slavic Heart, where Save the Children is working alongside local authorities to register families forced to flee their homes and provide them with temporary shelter. Through Slavic Heart, Save the Children is also providing online mental health sessions for children, and distributing diapers, blankets and other essential items to vulnerable families., “We still have some products we are distributing to arriving families thanks to Save the Children. However, supplies are running low, including water, and the need is rapidly growing,” said Nataliia. “About 8,000 people need help in this area. There is no communication between cities, so it makes getting supplies very difficult. Right now, we can only source locally.”, Millions of children remain trapped in Ukraine, seeking safety underground while bombing and shelling continue to escalate throughout the country. Access to food, clean water, and medicine may soon be out of reach for many children in Ukraine, with parents too frightened to wait in long lines at shops, which mainly have empty shelves., Freezing winter temperatures add to the long list of problems children in Ukraine are facing. Nataliia explained that children are travelling to the centre with few belongings, barely enough to keep them warm., “Our staff are noticing children are getting ill because they are so cold. However, there are no working pharmacies in the area, so getting medicine for families is extremely challenging,” Nataliia explained. “Some people are also in urgent need of very specific medication, such cancer treatment, insulin, and epilepsy medication. We managed to get some medicines but only in very small quantities.”, Russia’s continued military operation across Ukraine has pushed the country to the brink of a medical crisis. Some of the women at the centre require caesarean sections, but there are no surgeons in the area and the situation is worsening. Slavic Heart volunteers are helping to redirect women in labour to local health facilities to so they can safely give birth., With no end in sight for the deadly conflict, hundreds of thousands of people, mainly children and women, will continue to arrive in Poland, Romania, and other neighbouring countries. According to the UN, an estimated 1 million people have already left Ukraine, more than 400,000 of them are believed to be children., Irina Saghoyan, Save the Children’s Eastern Europe Director, said:, “We will not give up on the children in Ukraine. Our commitment to children and the communities we serve remains unchanged. Our incredible partners have been instrumental in ensuring we can still get life-saving aid to children and parents., “Children have witnessed or experienced acts of violence, some showing signs of significant distress. Our partner Slavic Heart is telling us that children urgently need mental health support, along with food, warm clothes and medicine. We need funding to ensure critical support can continue for children impacted by this crisis., “This conflict will have far-reaching consequences for children in Europe and around the world. We will continue to respond where we are most needed and where children need urgent protection.”, Save the Children has been working with Slavic Heart in eastern Ukraine since 2015, delivering essential items to families, and ensuring children are protected and have access to mental health support., Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, providing humanitarian aid to children and their families. This includes supporting access to education, distributing winter and hygiene kits, and providing cash grants to families.

Three ripple effects of the Ukraine crisis on children around the world,News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",4 Mar 2022,"4 March 2022 -- Russsia's military operation in Ukraine has already seen millions of children forced from their homes, with some fleeing across the border into neighbouring countries while others are seeking safety in underground shelters. At least 17 children are reported to have been killed to date., But the escalation in violence is also set to impact children in need in other countries at a time when they are already bearing the brunt of the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate emergency, and the world's worst hunger crisis this century., Save the Children outlines three ways that children beyond Eastern Europe could be affected by the Ukraine crisis:, 1) Risk of Hunger, The global reliance on Russia and Ukraine's wheat supply -- making up more than a quarter of the world's wheat in 2019 -- could end up cutting off this staple to populations in already fragile contexts, such as Yemen and Lebanon, and driving prices to skyrocket. In Lebanon, up to 80% of wheat imports come from Russia and Ukraine., The world is already facing the worst global hunger crisis this century, with an estimated 45 million people across 43 countries at risk of famine, up from 27 million in 2019. This is having a disastrous impact on children, who are always the most vulnerable in a food crisis. In 2020, almost 50 million children under the age of five were acutely malnourished[i]., Save the Children said that an immediate end to violence in Ukraine would not only protect children in the country but also prevent the deterioration of an already catastrophic situation for children and families beyond Europe who depend on exports for survival., 2) Mental health, Clearly children in Ukraine are suffering the most psychological distress as a result of Russia's military operation. But our digital age means that any child with access to a TV, radio, newspaper, computer or phone will be aware that there is conflict going on -- and many of them will be starting to understand the impact on other children. How do you talk to your child about war?, Ane Lemche, a psychologist and child counsellor with Save the Children, said: ""What is happening in Ukraine can be frightening for both children and adults. Ignoring or avoiding the topic can lead to children feeling lost, alone and more scared, which can affect their health and wellbeing. It is essential to have open and honest conversations with children to help them process what is happening."", Parents and caregivers can read more tools and tips to approach the conversation with children here., 3) Energy poverty, Global -- in particular, European -- reliance on Russian oil and gas has come into sharper focus, as the cost of Brent crude oil has surged to its highest level since 2012, and natural gas contracts have risen by an incredible 35%[ii]. Europe is reliant on Russia for 40% of its natural gas supplies., Save the Children has already warned that these rising prices will add to the already escalating cost of living crisis in the UK., Dan Paskins, Director of UK Impact at Save the Children, said: ""The prospect of energy price rising even more than has already been forecast is incredibly worrying for households on low incomes. Millions of parents will be wondering how they will be able to keep their families afloat in the months ahead., ""We're already seeing families having to make impossible choices between heating their homes and feeding their children. Parents we work with say they just don't know what they're going to cut back on next. A further increase in energy bills will leave even more children living in cold and damp homes, going to bed hungry, and missing out on the opportunities they need to grow and thrive."", The Children Emergency Fund allows Save the Children to respond wherever the need is greatest to reach children quickly with the essentials they need to survive., ENDS, NOTES TO EDITORS:, For further enquiries please contact:, Emily Wight, Emily.Wight@savethechildren.org, Our media out of hours (BST) contact is media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409, [i] 2020 Global Nutrition Report, [ii] New York Mercantile Exchange, 3 March 2022",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/three-ripple-effects-ukraine-crisis-children-around-world
WFP ramps up food operation for Ukraine and warns the world's hungry cannot afford another conflict,News and Press Release,WFP,Food and Nutrition,4 Mar 2022,"RZESZOW, Poland – As the emergency operation in Ukraine moved into high gear today, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) expressed deep concern about the waning ability of families in embattled areas to find food and also warned that the crisis could have consequences well beyond Ukraine’s borders., “In a year when the world is already facing an unprecedented level of hunger, it’s just tragic to see hunger raising its head in what has long been the breadbasket of Europe,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley during a visit to a staging hub set up by the organization on the Polish-Ukrainian border. “The bullets and bombs in Ukraine could take the global hunger crisis to levels beyond anything we’ve seen before.”, With reports coming in of severe shortages of food and water in Kyiv, the capital, and the northeastern city of Kharkiv, WFP teams are setting up operations and hubs in countries neighbouring Ukraine. These will both facilitate delivery of food assistance into the country and assist refugees coming over the borders., The immediate priority is to establish a food lifeline into Kyiv and other conflict hotspots. With consignments of food assistance arriving every day, WFP is in a race against time to pre-position food in areas where fighting is expected to flare. WFP is in the process of finding partners in Ukraine to help it distribute assistance and teams in neighbouring countries are identifying local vendors in order to purchase more stock., Amid a shortage of cash in Ukraine, WFP plans to provide assistance through food distributions, cash, and food vouchers that can be spent in selected shops. Food distributions will prioritize the big towns on the Ukraine side of the border where families are gathering as they wait to see how the conflict develops. WFP is prepared also plans to assist refugees who crossed the border to neighbouring countries., The Russian Federation and Ukraine are responsible for 29% of the global wheat trade. Any serious disruption of production and exports from the region could push food prices beyond their current 10-year highs. This will erode food security for millions of people, especially those who are already under stress because of high levels of food inflation in their countries., “This is not just a crisis inside Ukraine. This is going to affect supply chains, and particularly the cost of food,” Beasley warned. “Now we’re looking at a price hike that will cost us, in operational costs, anywhere from 60 and 75 million dollars more per month. And that means more people are going to go to bed hungry.”, At the start of 2022, the world is facing an unprecedented hunger challenge, as conflict and climate shocks compounded by COVID and rising costs drive millions of people closer to starvation -- threatening to increase migration and instability globally. With the numbers of hungry rising, WFP is calling for a step-change in global support for its operations., The United Nations World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change., Follow us on Twitter @wfp_media, CONTACT, For more information please contact (email address: firstname.lastname@wfp.org):, Shaza Moghraby, WFP/New York,

Forced displacement from Ukraine: notes on humanitarian protection and durable solutions,Analysis,RLI,Protection and Human Rights,4 Mar 2022,"Blog post by Kristin Bergtora Sandvik and Adèle Garnier, Introduction, The Russian invasion of Ukraine February 24 2022 marks the start of a new displacement crisis. In a statement on February 24, Filippo Grandi, the High Commissioner for Refugees, emphasized that ‘The humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war, but countless lives will be torn apart. We have already seen reports of casualties and people starting to flee their homes to seek safety’. UN officials estimate up to 4 million people could leave Ukraine if the situation deteriorates. As of March 4, 1.2 million people had fled Ukraine to other countries in the region., Ukraine was one of 15 republics of the Soviet Union and became an independent state in 1991. Ukraine is a 2002 signatory to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees. As of January 2022, it had a population of approximately 43 million. The country is bordered by Russia, Belarus, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova. To contribute to the understanding of the evolving displacement context and the implications for the international protection regime and durable solutions, this blog provides a set of initial reflections. We draw on our backgrounds in refugee and migration studies to do four things:, 1. A tentative state of the art, As part of this reflection, we have surveyed a set of key (English language) journals in refugee, migration and humanitarian studies to map out existing scholarship on displacement and the Ukrainian context. We are aware these are Global West publications and reflect what is visible in these areas of research, rather than a comprehensive overview of existing knowledge. In doing this work, we have also observed that there are important contributions published in law, area studies, history and cultural studies. Note that we mostly bracket Holodomor studies (see here and here) in this exercise., Journals such as Refugee Survey Quarterly and the International Journal of Refugee Law have not published on Ukrainian displacement. In the Journal of Refugee Studies, there are a few contributions on internal displacement and elections (Woroniecka-Krzyzanowska and Palaguta 2017); and politicization of religious actors as humanitarian providers and state failure (Leustean 2021). Forced Migration Review has published shorter interventions on asylum seekers in Poland (Szczepanik and Tylec 2016) and shelter (Dean 2017; Wetterwald and Thaller 2020) and also hosts older contributions on deportees (Uehling 2008) and statelessness (de Chickera and Whiteman 2014). As noted in an interesting contribution in a US law journal, surprisingly little attention has been given to the continued refugee resettlement of Ukrainians to the US on the grounds of religious persecution (Klokiw 2019)., The Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies features a substantial gender oriented literature on labor market participation, transnational marriages, motherhood (i.e. Górny and Kępińska 2004; Kindler and Szulecka 2013) but no contributions focusing on displacement and conflict in Ukraine. The International Migration Review is home to some older scholarship on Ukraine and European migration (Shamshur 1992) and on post-war Ukrainian refugee resettlement to Canada (Luciuk 1986). International Migration has a contribution on legal and illegal migration in the 2000s (Uehling 2004); and Migration Studies features publications on internal displacement (Uehling 2021) and socio-legal aspects of return migration (Kubal 2015). While we have found few scholars with a large body of published scholarship in this topical area, it might be noted that Greta Uehling, an anthropologist at the University of Michigan has been an important and prolific contributor to this field for more than two decades., In the adjacent field of humanitarian studies Journals such as Disasters, the Journal of Humanitarian Affairs and the Journal of Humanitarian action have nothing on Ukrainian displacement (though note Ukraine focus as part of the large scholarship on famine relief (Werther 2021). A contribution on Polish aid to Ukrainian internally displaced people (IDPs) is published in Humanitarian logistics(Piotrowicz 2018)., While the academic specialist fields of refugee and forced migration studies have a limited track record on Ukraine, a larger body of work on forced displacement can be found in area studies, (with a key point of reference being a special issue in Europe-Asia Studies 72.3 (2020)). This includes research on the IDPs (Kuznetsova and Mikheieva 2020) in Crimea (Charron 2020) and Donbas (Sereda 2020; Sasse and Lackner 2020); media representations of IDPs (Rimpiläinen 2020) IDPs and public space (Lazarenko 2021) and gender (Kuznetsova 2021; Khrystova and Uvarova 2022); humanitarian crisis (Scrinic 2015; Quinn 2015; Bulakh 2017)., 2. A century of Ukrainian displacement and resettlement, In the following, drawing on historical scholarship and scholarship in history, we provide a brief chronology of displacement in Ukraine over the past century. There was substantial out-migration to North America prior to the First World War (Chyz 1939). Between the early 1920s and 2020, Ukraine – until after the Second World War divided into Western and Eastern Ukraine – has experienced numerous periods of mass emigration, forced relocation and displacement. Before the first World War, poverty and land scarcity led to large scale migration from Western Ukraine (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and later Poland and Romania) to North America. In the East, peasants were subjected to massive, forced relocations to other parts of the Czarist empire. The annexation and deportation continued under Stalin. The Holodomor – to kill by starvation – was a man-made famine in Soviet Ukraine between 1932-1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. The famine was exacerbated by the governments rejection of outside aid, confiscation of household foodstuffs and the restriction of population movements (Basciani 2011). In addition to ethnic Ukrainians, national minorities were also oppressed and deported in the 1930s and 1940s (ethnic Germans, Crimean Tatars, Poles, Bulgarians, Armenians, and Greeks) (Malynovska 2006). As the international refugee regime began taking shape, the emergence of anti-immigration laws in the US (the Immigration Act of 1917, the Emergency Quota Act of 1921, and the Immigration Act of 1924) significantly curtailed transnational Ukrainian migration. Groups displaced by the first world war were again displaced by World War II from reception countries in eastern Europe (Kulischer 1949)., The Second World War took an enormous toll on Ukraine. While there are no reliable numbers available, 5 to 7 million people are estimated to have died, and an estimated additional 2.3 million Ukrainians were sent to Germany to perform forced labor. The repatriation agreement signed by Allied powers in at the Yalta conference in February 1945 categorized Ukrainians from the East as Soviet subjects to be forcibly repatriated to the USSR, and many fought to gain recognition as refugees. Ukrainian Displaced Persons (DPs) residing in the German, French, and British zones of temporary occupation at the end of the Second World War were a very mixed group comprising of Ukrainian prisoners of war taken by the Soviets, guerillas fighting against the Soviets, slave labor for the Nazis and Nazi-sympathizing Ukrainians. After the War, this group became classified as political refugees (Stebelsky 1991). In terms of overseas resettlement, in 1947, in a first for Australia, the country joined Argentina, Canada and the US in resettling DPs as part of the International Refugee Organization (IRO) resettlement agreement (Persian 2018). Post-war resettlement to Canada was a short-lived affair, due to conflicts between the established diaspora community and arriving DPs (Luciuk 1986). With respect to the US, of the 352,000 people admitted to the US under the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, 15 percent were Ukrainian, and most were Ukrainian speakers from Western Ukraine. Most Ukrainian immigrants were subject to the limitations that the National Origins Quota System regulating immigration from 1924 to1965. A specific case concerns the postwar trajectories of ethnic Germans (Volksdeutsche) from Ukraine. Under Nazi resettlement, this population had ended up in Germany and Austria. While not eligible to be assisted by IRO, some did seek assistance. Broadly belonging to Catholic, Protestant, and Mennonite faith groups, the latter was comparatively much more successful in utilizing religious networks for overseas emigration. While individual efforts to switch national identification mostly failed and petitioners living in ‘mixed’ marriages had some success, the well-organized Mennonites managed a ‘collective conversion’ from German to Dutch nationality and resettled as a group (Panagiotidis 2020). By 1955 only about 250,000 of the 2.3 million Ukrainians displaced because of World War II had been allowed to relocate abroad (Wenner 2010). By 1952, most Ukrainian refugees in DP camps had been resettled (Dyczok 2000)., In the post-World War period, religion has been a key structuring factor in resettlement. Post-World War II Ukrainian refugees tended to be Orthodox and Ukrainian Catholic; beginning especially in the late 1970s, numerous Soviet Jewish refugees arrived in the US (Basok and Brym 1991), along with smaller populations of Evangelicals, Baptists and Pentecostals. As president Gorbachev’s glasnost policy allowed people to apply for emigration on the grounds of religious persecution, refugees from various evangelical faiths settled at the end of the Cold War. Ukraine experienced economic crisis from the late 1980s until the late 2000s, engendering high outward migration. However, it was the 1990 Lautenberg Amendment that became a primary driver of Ukrainian immigration to the United States. On denominational grounds, Ukrainians were admitted as religious groups with a lesser group-based burden of proof with respect to discrimination. While initially intended as a temporary protection mechanism for persecuted religious minorities in the Soviet Union, it has become a central gateway for Ukrainian Jews, Catholics, Orthodox, Pentecostal, Baptist and Evangelicals (Klokiw 2019)., Whereas the 2001 USA PATRIOT Act took refugee admissions under 30,000 per year. Between 2001 and 2003, the US maintained a separate designation, and an associated quota, for countries from the ‘former Soviet Union.’ This quota was removed in 2004, when Ukraine was integrated into a broader ‘Europe’ refugee quota which led to a rapid decline of admissions. Nevertheless by 2011, Ukraine was among the ten countries with the most refugee arrivals (Capps 2015) during FY 2000 through FY 2011. By 2013, only 227 Ukrainian refugees were admitted (Klokiw 2019). At the Russian occupation of Crimea and the subsequent arrival of the Trump administration, the numbers surged again. While the Trump administration slashed the resettlement quota, by 2019, Ukrainians were one of the top groups resettled as refugees in the United States, with a 75 percent growth in arrivals. On a parallel track, Ukrainians have received high admissions under US visa schemes, making up the highest portion of overall European admissions from 2009 to 2018 (Klokiw 2019)., 3. The politics of displacement prior to the 2022 invasion, Ukraine has since the end of the Soviet Union been a country of origin, transit and arrival for forced migration, as well as a provider of ‘durable solutions’ for ethnic Ukrainians returning to the country form which they had been exiled during the Soviet era., In the 1990s, the ethnic composition of Ukraine changed significantly. Many ethnic Russians left, and many ethnic Ukrainians returned, including Tatars originally from Crimea, whose returned population increased fivefold between 1989 and 2001. Returnees arriving after the adoption of a new citizenship law in November 1991 did not have Ukrainian citizenship on arrival, as the new law linked citizenship to permanent residence in Ukraine. A sizable population was stateless, as Tatars also had not been granted citizenship of the ex-Soviet Republic in which they lived before their departure. The population from ex-Soviet Republics in which there were conflicts also increased, including from Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia., Ukraine developed a refugee protection framework from the 1990s, with the adoption of the Law on Refugees in 1993, the opening of a UNHCR Liaison Office in Kyiv in 1995, the ratification of the 1951 Geneva Convention and its 1967 Protocol in 2002. Asylum claims were processed from 1993. Asylum procedures were criticized as weak, with high levels of forced returns for instance of Chechens. Still, Ukraine recognizes several thousands of refugees a year, and this in some years has included sizable contingent of Afghan refugees since the 1990s. Ukraine in the 1990s was also a country of transit for irregular migrants, with 100 000 migrants being detained at its western borders between 1991 and 2003. Human trafficking, particularly of young women, also increased in the 1990s, and Ukraine ratified the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime in 2000. With the expansion of the European Union in 2004, and the perspective of an association agreement with Ukraine, the European Union focused on capacity building and contributed to fund asylum processing centres., The suspension of negotiations of the EU association agreement by a pro-Russia government in 2013 led to the Maidan protests in Kyiv and a pro-European regime change the following year, rapidly followed by Russia’s occupation of Crimea. 5.2 million people were affected by the conflict and 1.6 million were displaced within and outside Ukrainian borders, Ukrainian IDPs have moved westward. As of 2019, there were 1.4 million IDPs in Ukraine, the 12th-largest population of IDPs worldwide Outside the borders, most Ukrainians sought refuge in Russia, but many also went to European Union countries, where the refugee recognition rate was very low – many Ukrainian nationals did not apply for asylum., As of 2020, the main countries of origin of refugees and asylum seekers in Ukraine were Afghanistan, Syria, Russia and Bangladesh (the latter almost only asylum seekers), with a total of 2249 refugees and 2359 asylum seekers. There were also 35,875 stateless people. Besides, at the end of 2019, IOM estimated that there were between 37,000 and 60,900 irregular migrants in Ukraine, of various nationalities, concentrated in large cities, and with the largest shares from South Asia, West Africa and the Horn of Africa. The majority were young men with secondary education who had arrived with valid visas as tourists or students., 4. Pointers for advocacy, How the exodus from Ukraine will play out remains to be seen. Many of the structural impediments to transit and (temporary) settlement are not present in the current context. Ukrainians don’t require Schengen visas to enter the European union and can stay for up to 90 days. Furthermore, in an unprecedented move, Slovakia admits Ukrainians without valid passports ‘if they pass an individual assessment conducted by border officials’. Poland has also explained that they will admit those without valid documents. At the supranational level, the European Union has for the first time triggered the adoption of the EU temporary protection directive. The directive grants immediate protection, to Ukrainians and non-Ukrainians legally residing in Ukraine and fleeing toe war for one year. In terms of the traditional framework for durable solutions, traditional overseas resettlement countries have announced visa extensions for Ukrainians and priority processing of family reunification. Ukrainian diasporas, for instance in Canada, which hosts of one of the largest population with Ukrainian origins, are mobilizing resources to support their fellow nationals. Canada has also announced an emergency, two-year temporary protection measure for Ukrainian nationals fleeing the war, with no ceiling on eligible applications. Public opinion and politicians at municipal and provincial levels have signaled they will welcome Ukrainian refugees. Several countries are pressured to do more than the changes they first announced, such as the UK and Australia., At the same time, vulnerability is gendered: all men between 18 and 60 have been conscripted and denied exit from the country. Also, Ukrainian men are currently prevented from leaving Ukraine so as to be available in case of mass mobilization and this appears to disregard concerns for men in vulnerable situations or the impact of family separation. From this perspective, gender-based advocacy focusing on men is necessary, especially as it has not been a priority in refugee advocacy., Furthermore, the politics of solidarity are not universal: solidarity with Ukrainian refugees does not seem to apply to non-White people also fleeing Ukraine. Instances of discrimination and racism has been reported in Ukraine and at the Polish borders, with African students in Ukraine being trampled on or stopped from fleeing by border guards. The situation has been denounced by the African Union. All advocates should support fair treatment for all people affected by the war regardless of their ethnicity and migratory status., Finally, vulnerability is tiered. The invasion has meant further displacement for refugees who had fled to Ukraine, such as Afghans who had fled the Taliban‘s return to power in 2021. Governments and civil society providing support to forced migrants from Ukraine should ensure non-Ukrainians are not just not discriminated against, but rather prioritized given their particular vulnerability., We don’t know how long the invasion will last, what kind of conflict this will develop into and what the civilian toll will be. Our intervention, albeit a tentative exercise, aims to provide a background context for discussions – both scholarly and in various practitioner and activist communities – about humanitarian protection and durable solutions moving forward., Kristin Bergtora Sandvik, Cand.jur UiO 2002, S.J.D Harvard Law School 2008, is Research Professor in Humanitarian Studies, PRIO Professor of Sociology of Law, Department of Criminology and Sociology of Law, University of Oslo., Adèle Garnier is an Assistant Professor and the Director of undergraduate studies at the Department of geography, Université Laval, Canada., We would like to thank Greta Uehling for her careful reading and encouragement to publish this blog., Provisional bibliography, Basciani, Alberto. “From Collectivization of the Great Famine: Eyewitness Statements on the Holodmor by Refugees from the Ukrainian SSR, 1930–1933.” Holodomor Studies 3 (2011): 1-27., Basok, Tanya, and Robert J.

Protection and Human Rights",4 Mar 2022,"La organización está enviando cargamentos de suministros médicos de emergencia que empezarán a llegar en las próximas horas a la zona afectada, Madrid, 4 de marzo de 2022 - MSF está trabajando para ampliar rápidamente su respuesta médica y humanitaria en varios lugares de Ucrania. La organización está enviando cargamentos de suministros médicos de emergencia que empezarán a llegar en las próximas horas y días a la zona afectada por la crisis. Personal médico de urgencias y varios especialistas médicos con experiencia ya han entrado en Ucrania y en los próximos días seguirán llegando más refuerzos para apoyar a los equipos de MSF que ya estaban allí., Audios del responsable de Comunicación de la Unidad de Emergencias de Médicos Sin Fronteras, Igor García Barbero., Vídeo-declaraciones para medios de la responsable de Emergencias de MSF, Kate White., Vídeo y declaraciones del director de logística de MSF, Laurent Sury e imágenes de recurso del centro de logística de MSF en Burdeos., Los equipos de la organización ya están empezando a ver el impacto que está teniendo en la población civil la fuerte escalada del conflicto, aunque, con los combates en curso, resulta imposible determinar el verdadero alcance de las necesidades médicas que irán surgiendo a lo largo de los próximos días y semanas. En cualquier caso, se están preparando para poder estar operativos e intensificar su respuesta en función de los diversos escenarios que puedan llegar a producirse, incluyendo la prestación de atención quirúrgica, medicina de emergencia y apoyo a la salud mental de las poblaciones desplazadas., Mientras tanto, los equipos sobre el terreno en Ucrania han estado todos estos días proporcionado suministros médicos a los hospitales para la atención de urgencias y traumas y para llevar a cabo cirugías. ""En las últimas 48 horas, hemos entregado 420 kilos de suministros médicos a un hospital de la ciudad de Kramatorsk, en el este de Ucrania, que se ha visto muy afectada por el conflicto"", dice la responsable de la célula de emergencia de MSF, Kate White., Médicos Sin Fronteras afirma que, a día de hoy, resulta difícil encontrar suministros médicos y de todo tipo en el país, pues el número de pacientes que los necesitan no cesa de aumentar. Por ello, hacer llegar suministros de emergencia a los hospitales sigue siendo una las principales prioridades para la organización., ""Uno de los mayores problemas en estos momentos es la entrada de nuevos suministros en el país. La situación cambia rápidamente. Intentamos ser lo más ágiles posible para adaptar nuestra respuesta a la emergencia"", Alex Wade, coordinador de emergencias de MSF en Lviv (Ucrania)., Los equipos de la organización sobre el terreno aseguran que, en algunas zonas, los desplazamientos resultan difíciles, peligrosos o simplemente imposibles de llevar a cabo y que a veces es difícil obtener información precisa, ya que las redes de comunicación no siempre están operativas, mientras que la información que llega a través de los medios de comunicación y las redes sociales debe siempre comprobarse dos veces., ""No sabemos el número exacto de heridos. Algunos hospitales han informado de docenas de heridos, otros de cientos"", afirma Wade. ""Hemos perdido el contacto con algunas zonas. En muchas zonas no hay electricidad ni gas, por lo que no es posible calentar los edificios cuando las temperaturas caen por debajo del punto de congelación por la noche"", concluye Wade., Envío de equipos de emergencia a los países vecinos, MSF ha enviado equipos de emergencia a los países fronterizos con Ucrania, como Moldavia, Hungría, Eslovaquia, Rusia y Bielorrusia., “Estamos enviado 15 toneladas de material médico hacia dos destinos: el primero es Polonia con la situación de la gente que sale de Ucrania, pero también en relación con el deseo de apoyar la atención de los heridos dentro de Ucrania. El segundo destino es Rumanía y Moldavia, con el mismo objetivo. Como hicimos, por ejemplo, en Yibuti para Yemen, organizamos lo que llamamos bases de retaguardia, por las que transitan bienes y personas y que luego se redistribuyen a los distintos países en función de las capacidades operativas que tenemos en el terreno. El material que enviamos es fundamentalmente equipo médico, para realizar consultas, material fungible y medicamentos para la atención de los heridos”, explica el director de logística de MSF, Laurent Sury., Operaciones de MSF, En Polonia:, Es probable que los equipos de MSF establezcan su base en Polonia para coordinar y dar apoyo desde allí a las actividades en Ucrania. Desde allí, tratarán de suministrar medicamentos y material médico a los equipos en Ucrania., En Hungría:, Un equipo de MSF está evaluando la situación y las necesidades de las personas que cruzan la frontera, centrándose en identificar las necesidades médicas de las personas con mayores necesidades., En Moldavia:, MSF ha enviado equipos al sureste del país para evaluar la situación de los refugiados en los pasos fronterizos, centrándose en analizar la posibilidad de apoyar a los enfermos crónicos o las necesidades de salud mental. Al mismo tiempo, un equipo ha entrado en Ucrania y evaluará la posibilidad de llegar a ciudades como Odessa, Mykolaiv o Kherson., En Eslovaquia:, Alrededor de 79.000 refugiados han cruzado a Eslovaquia hasta el 2 de marzo, según ACNUR, aunque la mayoría parece estar en tránsito hacia otros países. Un equipo de emergencia de MSF llegó esta semana al país y hasta ahora se ha reunido con funcionarios administrativos y representantes de ONG locales. También han visitado algunas zonas fronterizas para evaluar las necesidades médicas y humanitarias no cubiertas., En Rusia:, MSF trabaja desde hace años con las autoridades sanitarias para reducir la carga y mejorar el tratamiento de la tuberculosis resistente a los medicamentos (DR-TB). En los últimos días, los equipos de la organización están llevando a cabo evaluaciones en el sur del país para comprobar si han surgido nuevas necesidades médico-humanitarias. También han realizado algunas donaciones como alimentos, kits de higiene y medicamentos para apoyar a los refugiados que salen de Ucrania., En Bielorrusia:, MSF sigue llevando a cabo sus programas habituales: apoyo al programa nacional de tuberculosis y tratamiento de la hepatitis C en las cárceles. En 2021, los equipos de la organización también asistieron a las personas desplazadas entre Bielorrusia y la UE. Los equipos de MSF en Bielorrusia están evaluando actualmente si han surgido nuevas necesidades médicas humanitarias en el país., * * *, Más información:, MSF trabajó por vez primera en Ucrania en 1999 y desde 2014 cuenta con una serie de proyectos regulares en el país. En los últimos años, la organización ha trabajado en el campo de la tuberculosis resistente a los medicamentos, la hepatitis C, el VIH avanzado y la mejora del acceso a la atención primaria de salud para las personas afectadas por el conflicto. La actual escalada del conflicto armado nos ha obligado a reorientar rápidamente nuestras actividades para responder a esta crisis y todas las actividades regulares se interrumpieron el pasado 24 de febrero., Fernando Calero García

Ukraine: UN appeal includes $183.5 million for urgent food and agricultural livelihoods assistance [EN/AR/RU/ZH],News and Press Release,FAO,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",4 Mar 2022,"FAO Director-General highlights need to safeguard access to food, reinforce food security, 02/03/2022, Rome – The United Nations flash appeal in support of Ukraine released Tuesday seeks to provide food and agricultural livelihoods assistance as well as cash for urgent needs to some 2.8 million people in a bid to avert a food security crisis there, alongside a raft of other humanitarian measures., Among these, 1.3 million people will receive cash transfers for meeting urgent needs, including food. Another 1.5 million people will be reached by partners in the Food Security and Livelihoods Cluster – co-led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) – with in-kind donations of food and agricultural inputs. To do this, the partners in the Cluster require $183.5 million., “In 2021, one in four people in Eastern Ukraine were already food insecure as a result of various challenges and the COVID-19 pandemic, with 1.1 million people in need of food and agricultural assistance,” the FAO Director-General QU Dongyu said, expressing his concern about the potential impact of the current emergency on access to food and the possible expansion of food insecurity among affected communities., FAO at the ready, Speaking at the Launch of the UN’s Humanitarian Flash Appeal and the Regional Refugee Response Plan for Ukraine, the Director-General reaffirmed FAO’s intention to scale up support in providing cash for vulnerable households and emergency agricultural support, together with partners., The flash appeal was presented by Martin Griffiths, UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, and Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres, delivered opening remarks., FAO has a field presence across all of Ukraine and experience in delivering cash-based assistance to rural communities in the country., Qu emphasized that boosting access to food and bolstering food security must be a priority, and demands collective attention., According to the appeal, the drastic deterioration of the security situation in Ukraine could exponentially increase the number of food insecure households, as farming families and owners of small agricultural operations flee conflict-affected areas. Farmers could miss the May planting season, the appeal notes., Priority activities aimed at averting food security crisis under the appeal include: conducting a rapid food security assessment to better estimate needs; mobilizing food security assistance; providing hot meals in collective centres; distributing emergency food kits; and delivering agricultural inputs including vegetable garden seeds, tools as well as veterinary care to farm animals so farmers can continue to produce and sustain household and local community nutrition., Global ramifications, Qu also warned about possible implications of the crisis for food security beyond the region, including countries who rely to varying degrees on wheat sourced from that region., Disruptions to international food markets resulting from the conflict could potentially put pressure on import-reliant countries, especially those already experiencing high levels of food insecurity or grappling with their own food crises., Contact

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24.00 3 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],Situation Report,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,4 Mar 2022,"From 4am on 24 February 2022 until 12 midnight on 3 March 2022, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 1,006 civilian casualties in Ukraine: 331 killed (71 men, 40 women, 7 boys, and 3 girls, as well as 9 children and 201 adults whose sex is yet unknown) and 675 injured (51 men, 40 women, 9 girls, and 2 boys, as well as 20 children and 553 adults whose sex is yet unknown)., 440 casualties (77 killed and 363 injured) were recorded in Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 331 (54 killed and 277 injured) in Government-controlled territory, and 109 (23 killed and 86 injured) in territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’., 566 casualties (254 killed and 312 injured) were recorded in other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, and Zhytomyr regions) in places, which were under Government control when casualties occurred., Most of the civilian casualties recorded from 4am on 24 February 2022 until 12 midnight on 3 March 2022, were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the real figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intensive hostilities have been going on was delayed and many reports were still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, the town of Volnovakha (Government-controlled part of Donetsk region) where hundreds of civilian casualties have been alleged. These figures are being further corroborated and are not included in the above statistics., On 1 March, the Minister of Health of Ukraine said that 16 children have been killed since 24 February. According to the Adviser – the Commissioner of the President of Ukraine for the Rights of the Child and Children’s Rehabilitation, as of 4 March, 28 children were killed and 64 were injured in Government-controlled territory. OHCHR also notes a report by the Ministry of Emergencies of Ukraine, according to which as of 09.00 (Kyiv time) 4 March, the total number of civilian casualties in Kharkiv region was 39 killed and 272 injured, including 10 children.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-3-march-2022-enruuk
IRC statement on the European Union granting of temporary protection to people fleeing Ukraine,News and Press Release,IRC,Protection and Human Rights,4 Mar 2022,"**Brussels, Belgium, March 4, 2022 —**Imogen Sudbery, Senior Director of Policy and Advocacy for IRC Europe said,, ""The IRC welcomes the European Union's move to grant Temporary Protection Status to civilians fleeing Ukraine. The decision will grant people fleeing the conflict temporary protection in Europe for up to three years, without having to apply for asylum, and with a broad set of rights including access to work, housing, social assistance and education across the EU. This is a vital step to ensure that states can manage the response effectively and people receive the swift support they need, and a welcome demonstration of solidarity with refugees., ""It is imperative that states implement this in an inclusive way, and offer protection to all people fleeing conflict in Ukraine, including asylum seekers and other people with short-term residence status in Ukraine who may be unable to return home. States must also continue to uphold access to asylum and safe passage for all seeking international protection, including anyone falling outside of the scope of the Temporary Protection Directive., ""Building on this decision, EU states must work together to mobilize a truly pan-European response. We encourage states receiving the majority of refugees from Ukraine to welcome and facilitate the support available from EU agencies, international organizations, civil society, and EU member states, to enable them to respond humanely and effectively to the rising numbers of people seeking protection. This includes boosting reception capacity and quality, bolstering asylum and integration systems and ensuring safe passage to everyone seeking safety regardless of nationality, color or creed. It is essential to ensure sufficient support and humanitarian aid is made available for Ukraine, Moldova, Poland and other refugee-hosting EU states., ""With this decision, the EU has demonstrated that with political will, a fair, humane and effective response to forced migration is perfectly feasible. It must be a catalyst to spur long overdue reforms to ensure Europe has a longer term system in place that works for both local communities and people arriving in need of protection."", The IRC has been responding to humanitarian crises in Europe since 2015, where we launched an emergency response to the peak in migration in Greece and relaunched operations in Serbia. Our teams provided water, health and sanitation, and psychosocial support to refugees and migrants. Since then, the IRC has also provided support to refugees and migrants in Germany from 2016, Italy from 2017, and Bosnia-Herzegovina from 2020. Last year, the IRC also started to provide integration support to refugees and their local communities in the UK. The IRC is now working with partners in Poland and Ukraine to provide essential humanitarian services to people displaced as a result of the Russian invasion., In Poland, which is preparing to receive up to 1 million refugees, the IRC is working to scale up support to the government and civil society and to provide for the basic needs of people fleeing the conflict. The IRC is working partners in Poland and Ukraine that are quickly mobilizing resources to provide critical support to civilians forced to flee their homes.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/irc-statement-european-union-granting-temporary-protection-people-fleeing-ukraine

Ukraine: UN committee urges end to killings of children,News and Press Release,UNCRC,Protection and Human Rights,4 Mar 2022,"GENEVA (4 March 2022) -- With at least 19 children killed and 31 injured in the armed conflicts during Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the past few days, the UN Child Rights Committee today demanded the Russian Federation to immediately cease its aggression and military actions and uphold its obligations to protect children from physical and psychological violence. The Committee issued the following statement:, ""Children in Ukraine are currently subject to extreme suffering and trauma. They are being killed and injured. They are separated from their families. Homes are being destroyed. Their education is interrupted. There are reports of schools, orphanages and hospitals being attacked. Their daily lives and routines have been utterly shattered. As a consequence of the military attack on Ukraine, children are exposed to extreme violence and experience unbearable levels of fear and anxiety., The Convention on the Rights of the Child enshrines the children's rights to life, survival and development and the whole range of rights to water, food, housing, health, education and freedom from all forms of violence. Children are entitled to care, assistance and protection at all times. Unfortunately, history has shown many times over that children are among the most affected in situations of armed conflict., The Committee on the Rights of the Child is deeply disturbed by the fact that grave violations of children's rights in Ukraine are being committed by the Russian Federation's aggression and military attack in Ukraine, in violation of the Charter of the United Nations. According to the Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights, between 4am on 24 February and midnight on 3 March, the deaths of at least 19 children and injuries of 31 children were recorded. Children will suffer from profound, long-lasting physical, psychological, emotional and traumatic consequences., As the preamble of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict emphasizes, peace and security based on full respect of the purposes and principles contained in the Charter and observance of applicable human rights instruments are indispensable for the full protection of children, in particular during armed conflicts., The Committee on the Rights of the Child demands that the Russian Federation immediately ceases aggression and military actions against Ukraine and that it upholds its obligations under the Convention as espoused by the United Nations Secretary-General to enforce the United Nations Charter to protect children's rights to the utmost degree and as the highest priority."", ENDS, For more information and media requests in Geneva, please contact:*, Vivian Kwok at +41 (0) 22 917 9362 / vivian.kwok@un.org or UN Human Rights Office Media Section at +41 (0) 22 928 9855 / ohchr-media@un.org*, Background:, The Committee on the Rights of the Child monitors States parties' adherence to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols on involvement of children in armed conflict, and on sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.

Conflict in Ukraine: What do we know about the internal displacement situation so far?,News and Press Release,IDMC,Protection and Human Rights,4 Mar 2022,"Since Russia launched a military offensive against Ukraine on 24th February, civilians have been fleeing and displacement is rising sharply, especially as the capital, Kyiv, and other major cities, are under attack. The ongoing conflict may trigger Europe's largest forced displacement crisis in decades. As the conflict intensifies, the number of refugees is increasing every day, but the situation for internally displaced people is far less clear. Here’s what we know, and what we don’t know, so far., At least one million people are estimated to have been newly displaced in Ukraine as of early March, according to the United Nations Protection Cluster. With attacks coming from the north, south and east, and the toll on civilian infrastructure and civilian casualties rising, many people are on the move towards safer locations in the west of the country, or seeking protection across borders., More than 900,000 people have reportedly evacuated by train from the east. Evacuations are becoming increasingly difficult due to military actions as well as limited access to fuel and information on safe accommodation options. Elderly people and people with disabilities face compounded hardships in accessing safety. Due to security risks, people are taking shelter in basements, underground car garages, air raid shelters and subway stations., Family separation is a significant concern, with conscription-aged men barred from leaving the country and thus those on the move are primarily women, children and the elderly. There have also been alarming reports that African and Asian residents, as well as Ukrainian Roma have been subject to incidences of discrimination, particularly at the borders of Ukraine, increasing their exposure to protection risks which could heighten their risk of internal displacement., This fast-changing situation is also representing a major challenge for humanitarian response, which in turn is making it difficult to fully understand the scale and patterns of internal displacement and how they relate to cross-border flight., Expected displacement dynamics, With active hostilities continuing, there are a range of scenarios that could unfold. So far, most displacement has been to the west of Ukraine. Depending on how fast Russian military forces gain further territory in the north, east and south, more movements to the west could be expected., As fighting intensifies in urban areas, people may be displaced multiple times in their search for safety. Before this country-wide military offensive, the conflict in the eastern provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk left an estimated 854,000 people internally displaced. Many of them may have been displaced again as hostilities advanced towards the west., Given that this is a fast-changing situation, it is not possible to estimate how many people will remain displaced within Ukraine and how many will seek international protection across borders. Ongoing insecurity combined with high damage and destruction of homes and infrastructure mean that people are likely to remain displaced for prolonged periods of time. Furthermore, shortages in food, medical, electricity, gas and water supplies may aggravate the overall situation for those who are on the move., As much of the population trapped in the cities under attack is now unable to flee due to shelling and roadblocks, further waves of displacement could also be expected at a later stage. Allowing them to move out of harm’s way will be critical., What next?, Conflict in Ukraine will have severe impacts on civilians, including the destruction of infrastructure, disruption to public services, mass displacement and a rapid rise in humanitarian needs. After eight years of protracted conflict, needs were already high for some Ukrainians, and were further exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic., Civilians, of all nationalities, must be protected and prioritised while politicians negotiate a swift resolution to the conflict, including a ceasefire. Humanitarian corridors need to be secured and respected to evacuate at-risk people from cities under attack and get aid supplies in to support the most vulnerable., The reaction of countries who have welcomed refugees with open arms must be commended. But solutions can't stop at the border, the implications for internally displaced people are likely to be far-reaching and long-lasting. They need our support more than ever., For further information, please contact: Dawn Vout, Head of External Relations",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/conflict-ukraine-what-do-we-know-about-internal-displacement-situation-so-far

They called on all humanitarian agencies to intervene. Many speakers called for the set-up of an independent monitoring mechanism to investigate the violation of human rights as a result of the Russian aggression against Ukraine. There was also a call for the Council to establish a Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Russia and to abolish the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on unilateral coercive measures. Calls were made on Member States to take the strongest measures possible and establish an armed embargo. This was a war on the founding principles of the United Nations. Russia must immediately stop its hostilities; it must stop targeting civilians and bombing indiscriminately. These actions amounted to war crimes and the Council must use all its power to ensure accountability. Vladimir Putin was a war criminal and must be held accountable for his crimes against humanity. Russia had chosen the path of destruction and anyone challenging the state narrative was facing prison. National human rights institutions must not be the target of reprisals and the rights of journalists must be respected. Russia must respect the right of journalists to cover the military operations; journalists were never a legitimate target of war., There was an urgent need to prevent an escalation of a nuclear war. The Council should send the message that there would not be any impunity for the crimes of Russia. Speakers said States looked to the Security Council for protection, yet it was blocked by the same country that was attacking Ukraine, so they were now looking to the Human Rights Council and the International Criminal Court for them to protect the most vulnerable. Calls were made to suspend Russia's Council membership. The decision of the International Criminal Court to open an investigation was welcomed. Every day of delay from the international community was lethal; dictators around the world were watching and the international community was sending them the signal that arbitrary use of force could go unpunished. Speakers recognised the right of people to fight for self-determination and were concerned that this unlawful use of force had created the impression that it was acceptable. The Council was urged to reiterate that any use of force, unless as a defence against an act of aggression, was not acceptable. Member States were obliged to apply higher standards of human rights. Concerns were expressed about the safety of migrants and calls were made to the Office of the Human Rights Commissioner to closely monitor the human rights situation of vulnerable groups that were exposed to increased risks., Link: https://www.ungeneva.org/en/news-media/meeting-summary/2022/03/morning-human-rights-council-establishes-independent",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/human-rights-council-establishes-independent-international-commission-inquiry
Ukraine: Council unanimously introduces temporary protection for persons fleeing the war,News and Press Release,EU,Protection and Human Rights,4 Mar 2022,"The Council today adopted unanimously an implementing decision introducing temporary protection due to the mass influx of persons fleeing Ukraine as a consequence of the war., Temporary protection is an emergency mechanism which can be applied in cases of mass influx of persons and which aims to provide an immediate and collective (i.e. without the need for the examination of individual applications) protection to displaced persons who are not in a position to return to their country of origin. The objective is to alleviate pressure on national asylum systems and to allow displaced persons to enjoy harmonised rights across the EU. These rights include residence, access to the labour market and housing, medical assistance, and access to education for children., Once adopted, the decision will activate temporary protection for an initial period of one year. That period may be extended automatically by six monthly periods for a maximum of one year. The Commission may propose to the Council to extend the temporary protection up to one more year. It may also propose to end the temporary protection if the situation in Ukraine is such as to permit safe and durable return., Ukrainian nationals, as well as third country nationals or stateless persons benefiting from international protection in Ukraine and their family members will benefit from temporary protection if they resided in Ukraine before or on 24 February 2022. For third country nationals residing in Ukraine before or on 24 February with a permanent residence permit and who cannot safely return to their country member states shall apply either temporary protection or adequate protection under their national law., Member states may also apply this decision to other persons, including any third country nationals residing legally in Ukraine and who are unable to safely return to their country of origin, as well as Ukrainians who fled not long before 24 February or who found themselves in EU territory just before that date, for example for holiday or work purposes., As part of this decision, the Commission will coordinate cooperation and exchange of information among member states, in particular in relation to monitoring reception capacities and identifying any need for additional support. EU agencies, including Frontex, the EU asylum agency and Europol can provide further operational support at the request of member states., Background, On 24 February 2022, Russian armed forces launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine. As a result, substantial areas of Ukrainian territory now constitute areas of armed conflict from which thousands of persons are fleeing. On that same day, the European Council condemned Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified military aggression against Ukraine in the strongest possible terms and demanded Russia’s full respect for Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence., The EU has shown, and will continue to show, its resolute support for Ukraine and its citizens. At their extraordinary meeting on 27 February, home affairs ministers discussed the possibility of establishing an appropriate temporary protection mechanism for the reception of persons seeking refuge in the EU. On 2 March, the Commission proposed activating the mechanism provided for by the 2001 directive on temporary protection., Press contacts

Ukraine Casualty Monitor: AOAV data on harm to civilians by explosive weapons,Situation Report,AOAV,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",10 Mar 2022,"Total civilian casualties*:449
-Killed: 249
-Injured: 200
Updated: 10 March 2022, *This figure refers to the number of civilians killed or injured by explosive weapon use in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 Feb 2022, gathered using incident-specific English language media reporting. See AOAV’s methodology., Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on the 24th of February 2022, hundreds – if not thousands – of civilians have been killed and injured across the country. Russian air strikes, missile strikes, and artillery shelling have targeted densely populated urban centres, apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, military bases and vital infrastructure nationwide. The UN estimates that over a million people, mostly women and children, have fled Ukraine into neighbouring Poland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, and the number of internally displaced people continues to grow. Humanitarian corridors of evacuation have been attacked, lines of traffic stretch kilometres at border crossings and out of major cities, and a fuel crisis and freezing temperatures compound the struggle to find safety. Men between the ages of 18 and 60 have been banned from leaving the county, and millions of civilians remain in Ukraine, sheltering from the violence of the Russian advance, providing essential goods and services, and fighting alongside Ukrainian armed forces., Civilian casualties have been reported in the nation’s capital Kyiv, eastern Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, as well as Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Zhytomyr, and Odessa, among others., Since the start of the recent fighting, Ukraine’s interior ministry estimates that at least 2,000 civilians have died as of 3 March, though emergency services say this number is just an estimation as many people remain trapped under rubble and ongoing bombardments. Ukraine’s government has said that at least 11,000 Russian soldiers have been killed, while Russia’s Defence Minister Igor Konashenkov claims that 498 Russian troops have been killed and more than 1,500 wounded. Konashenkov said that among Ukrainian troops, 2,870 have been killed, around 3,700 injured and 572 captured., As of 6 March 2022, the OHCHR said that 1,123 civilian casualties in Ukraine have been verified: 364 killed, including 25 children, and 759 injured, since the Russian invasion began., Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) – which takes its sources from reputable English language media – has recorded 585 casualties from explosive weapon use since the Russian invasion began (24 Feb – 10 Mar), across 64 incidents. 339 civilian casualties were recorded (249 killed, 200 injured), and 136 armed-actor casualties (102 killed, 34 injured). Among the civilian casualties are at least 39 children, 18 women and 43 men., 97% (434) of civilian casualties have occurred in populated areas. Of the total recorded casualties (including armed-actors), 97% (569) have occurred in populated areas., Air-launched explosive weapons (specifically air strikes) have caused 51% (229) of civilian casualties. Ground-launched explosive weapons (missile strikes, artillery shelling, and rockets) have caused 48% (215) of civilian casualties. >1% (5) of civilian casualties have been caused by naval-launched weapons and landmines., Civilian casualties from explosive weapons have been recorded in Kyiv (108 civilians), Kharkiv (88), Chernihiv (80), Donetsk (71), Sumy (34), Zhytomyr (29), Mykolaiv (11), Odesa (10), Luhansk (8), Vinnytsia (6), Kherson (3), and Cherkasy (1)., The location-types in which civilian casualties have been reported are urban residential areas (174 civilian casualties), Multiple urban spaces (74 civilians), villages (43), hospitals (39), public buildings (30), schools (24), commercial premises (18), other (13), armed bases (9), town centres (6), transport related infrastructure (5), no location information (5), roads (3), hotels (3), agricultural land (2), and markets (1)., AOAV’s casualty figures represent the lowest of estimations in terms of the number of people killed and injured by explosive weapon use. In an effort to quantify the explicit harm caused by specific explosive weapons, AOAV solely records incident-specific casualty figures, as reported in English-language media. Much of the casualty reporting since the beginning of the invasion has focussed on cumulative or region-specific casualty figures, making it unclear precisely when and where these deaths and injuries occurred. Each recorded incident of civilian harm from the use of explosive weapons since the beginning of the Russian invasion is listed below., Casualty-causing Incidents of Explosive Weapon Use in Ukraine (Since 24 February 2022), 10 March 2022, 9 March 2022, 8 March 2022, 7 March 2022, 6 March 2022, 5 March 2022, 4 March 2022, 3 March 2022, 2 March 2022, 1 March 2022, 28 February 2022, 26 February 2022, 25 February 2022, 24 February 2022, Civilian Casualties in Ukraine, 2014-2021, Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) has monitored an escalation in violence in the Donbas region, which borders Russia, and where violence between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists has occurred since 2014., Between 2014 and 2021, AOAV recorded 5,242 deaths and injuries in Ukraine, including 2,704 civilians and 2,538 armed actors and security personnel. Of the civilian casualties recorded, 2,381 (88%) were caused by explosive weapon use in populated areas., Ground-launched weapons, such as shelling, mortars, rockets, or grenades, for example, have accounted for 2,459 civilian casualties since 2014 – 91% of total civilian casualties., Of the civilian casualties, the vast majority occurred in 2014 and 2015, with 1,428 and 862 civilian deaths and injuries in these years respectively. Despite continued sporadic shelling across the line of control, which divides the region of Donbas, civilian casualties have fallen quite consistently since 2014, with 28 recorded last year. Fewer civilian casualties are also likely to have occurred as numerous civilians have fled the worst impacted areas in Donbas since 2014, leaving an aging population, many of whom cannot leave., In many instances of shelling since 2014, the perpetrator has not been identified, but where they have, Ukrainian separatist forces have been responsible for at least 667 civilian casualties and Ukraine for 783., In the days preceding the Russian invasion, there was an increase in shelling across the line of control, which has resulted in seven civilian casualties. At least three civilians were injured on February 17th when separatist shelling hit a school in Luhansk. On the same day, separatist shelling left another woman injured in Marinka as she waited for a bus. Shelling by Ukrainian forces was also reported to have left one woman injured on February 17th. On February 20th, 2 civilian deaths were reported due to Ukrainian shelling in occupied areas of Luhansk. And, on February 21st, a civilian was killed and homes damaged by separatist shelling on Donetsk., This escalation in violence and the Russian invasion is likely to be disastrous for civilians, as highlighted by the statement released today by the International Network on Explosive Weapons (INEW), of which AOAV is a founding member., AOAV condemns the use of violence against civilians and the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. AOAV encourages all armed actors to stop using explosive weapons with wide-area affects where there is likely to be a high concentration of civilians.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-casualty-monitor-aoav-data-harm-civilians-explosive-weapons

IOM’s Flash Appeal for Ukraine and Neighbouring Countries seeks to mobilize USD 350 million in order to meet the needs of crisis affected people inside Ukraine and its neighbouring countries, including Belarus, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia., This flash appeal outlines IOM’s proposed response over the next six months (March-August 2022)1 , focusing on a range of activities that aim to meet the varied needs of those impacted on the crisis and is fully aligned with inter-agency appeals launched in response to the crisis., Situation Overview, UKRAINE, On 24 February 2022, the Russian Federation launched a broad military offensive against Ukraine. The situation in the country quickly deteriorated, with major attacks being reported across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv. Russian troops quickly expanded their presence with military clashes ongoing in major cities including Chernihiv (north), Kharkiv (north-east), Kherson (south), Mariupol (south-east), Mykolaiv (south), Odessa (south-west), Sumy (north), amongst others, while the pre-existing hostilities in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts significantly intensified.
The humanitarian community is currently projecting around 6.7M internally displaced persons (IDPs) within Ukraine, as well as a major flow of refugees and migrants towards neighbouring countries, requiring humanitarian border management support, including in the field of health and shelter. The overall unpredictability of the situation requires humanitarian actors to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable displaced and other conflict-affected communities – and particularly female-headed households, children, persons with disabilities and/or chronic illnesses, as well as the elderly., NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES, According to initial figures from IOM’s teams in neighbouring countries, over 600,000 people left Ukraine in the first five days following the start of military operations and the escalation of hostilities. IOM and its partners estimate that over 4 million people, including refugees, third-country nationals and other migrants, may flee the country over the course of the next six months, many of whom will be in need of humanitarian protection and support. IOM is particularly concerned about the situation of stranded migrants within Ukraine, who number over 470,000 according to current estimates., At the same time, there is a need to ensure that those who seek to leave areas of conflict be allowed to do so, without discrimination. Current reports of prejudice and ill treatment of third country nationals, as well as fears of the instrumentalization of migrants to exacerbate regional tensions -akin to what was seen on the Poland-Belarus border in late 2021 – have prompted IOM to work closely with immigration officials in neighbouring countries and relevant consulates to ensure the rapid and nondiscriminatory processing of affected people in all border areas.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-flash-appeal-ukraine-and-neighbouring-countries-march-august-2022-published-1

The decision allows for responsibility-sharing among EU States for those with Temporary Protection Status. This will include cooperation on reception among EU Member States., UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, urges EU States to swiftly implement the Directive to continue to provide those fleeing the violence with much needed safety and protection - as the situation in the country continues to deteriorate and numbers of people fleeing continue to rise. This is fast becoming Europe’s largest refugee crisis this century., Many EU States have already shown great support, and yesterday’s decision reinforces this solidarity, which we hope will continue. UNHCR also welcomes the recent guidance issued by the Commission to EU States encouraging them to be flexible with border controls and suggesting measures to decongest borders., UNHCR stands ready to support governments and other stakeholders to provide protection and humanitarian assistance to those forced to flee in this refugee crisis of unprecedented proportions., Background, EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers met on 03 March to discuss the European Commission’s proposal to activate the EU Temporary Protection Directive (TPD) given the situation in Ukraine and arrivals to the EU of people seeking safety. Ministers agreed to the proposal and this is the first time the TPD has been activated. The decision to trigger the TPD will enter into force on the day it is published in the Official Journal of the EU., Set up in the aftermath of the Yugoslav war, the TPD was designed to be used in the event of a “mass influx or imminent mass influx” of people coming into an EU State. It is a form of temporary protection aimed at offering immediate help by granting large groups of people collective protection status. These people would have protection status for up to a year (with a possibility of extension of up to three years), without going through individual asylum claims, and allowing access to housing and other benefits (e.g. education, health, social welfare, residency permits). The Directive also lays down criteria for the reunification of separated families in the case that one or several relatives enjoy temporary protection but others do not. Once reunited, all members have to be granted residence permits to stay in the host country. To implement the TPD, at least 15 out of 27 EU States must agree to it., For further information:, Frederik Bordon (Brussels): bordon@unhcr.org , +32 476 42 01 34 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/news-comment-unhcr-welcomes-eu-decision-offer-temporary-protection-refugees-fleeing

Ocho años de conflicto, sumados a las restricciones de movimiento debidas a la pandemia, les han impedido ver a sus familiares en el otro lado de la línea de contacto., Como consecuencia de la escalada en el conflicto y los desplazamientos de población, el contacto con familiares y personas queridas puede verse agravado, lo que causa enorme incertidumbre y dolor. En este contexto, cobra especial importancia el servicio de ‘Restablecimiento del contacto familiar’ que Cruz Roja Española (en coordinación con el Movimiento Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja) ha puesto a disposición de la población ucraniana residente en el España, que puede ayudar a localizar a familiares con quienes se haya perdido el contacto desde que se escaló el conflicto., Así, para las personas que lo necesiten, existe un formulario web en la página de Cruz Roja en el que se puede acceder a este servicio., El programa de ‘Restablecimiento del contacto familiar’ no es una novedad para Cruz Roja, que lo trabaja en todo el mundo desde prácticamente el inicio de su función humanitaria para casos de conflicto, migraciones o desastres naturales., De manera paralela, Cruz Roja Española hace un llamamiento conseguir fondos con los que atender las necesidades humanitarias de la población afectada en Ucrania y países vecinos.

Protection and Human Rights",4 Mar 2022,"The Commission continues to work at all levels to channel humanitarian and civil protection support to Ukraine and neighbouring countries. As needs grow exponentially, further assistance will be deployed in Ukraine via the rescEU medical stockpiles based in Germany, Hungary and the Netherlands., The rescEU support includes ventilators, infusion pumps, patient monitors, masks and gowns, ultrasound devices and oxygen concentrators., Furthermore, as announced by President von der Leyen the European Commission has established civil protection logistical hubs in Poland, with others being set up in Romania and Slovakia, to distribute required aid to Ukraine as quick as possible. These hubs will help channel the assistance being delivered from 27 European countries via the EU's Civil Protection Mechanism., The EU also continues to support neighbouring countries that have already received over 1 million displaced people from Ukraine. Greece, Austria and Germany have offered masks, disinfectants and bedding, tents, clothing to Slovakia., Also, teams of EU civil protection experts are on their way to Moldova and Poland to assist the authorities. Assistance from the Netherlands, France and Greece was delivered to Moldova on 3 March via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, while Swedish, Danish, Finish and Croatian assistance is on the way., Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, visited Poland on 2 March and Moldova on 3 March to assess the situation. Commissioner Lenarčič said: “This illegal and unprovoked Russian aggression against Ukraine is amounting to a humanitarian catastrophe not seen in decades in Europe. Over a million people have already fled to the neighbouring countries receiving unprecedented support. However, considerably more people are still in need of protection inside Ukraine. Humanitarian corridors that ensure the free and safe movement of civilians and delivery of humanitarian aid are among the key prerequisites for addressing the needs of the population in Ukraine, which is the greatest casualty of this war. It is imperative that civilians are protected and humanitarian workers can do their jobs in safety and without impediments, as obliged by international humanitarian law.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-eu-boosts-assistance-emergency-logistical-hubs-and-resceu-aid
"Ukraine: Aged and those with disabilities face heightened risks, say UN experts",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,4 Mar 2022,"GENEVA (4 March 2022) – UN human rights experts today called for the protection of those with disabilities and older people caught up in the violence in Ukraine, saying they face heightened risk of injury and abuses, as they do not want or are unable to flee the hostilities., “Persons with disabilities and older persons during armed conflict are often left behind because of a lack of consideration of their particular needs, leading in many cases to abandonment,” said the Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, Gerard Quinn, and the Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons, Claudia Mahler., The experts reiterated the international humanitarian law obligation to prioritize the evacuation of individuals who are older and those with disabilities, as well as the requirement that parties to the conflict establish agreements to safely remove them from besieged and encircled areas. The experts pointed to the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson among others., The Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols of 1977 explicitly state all civilians not taking part in hostilities must be protected, while also recognizing that special respect and protection is due to persons with disabilities and older persons during armed conflict. These obligations are also provided for by Article 11 of the CRPD and reiterated in UN Security Council resolution 2475 (2019)., The experts said they were especially concerned over the reported or threatened use of explosive weapons in Ukraine with a wide area of effect in populated areas. “These weapons have a deadly and long lasting impact on persons with disabilities and older persons by exacerbating pre-existing disability, disrupting essential services like healthcare, and significantly impacting their mental and psychological health,” they said. “Intense urban warfare, by necessary implication, destroys the very fabric of supports on which many civilians rely.”, They said their chances of a successful evacuation were slim given their mobility impairment and the general lack of inclusive rescue processes and the confusion that inevitably follows from an invasion., The experts emphasized the need to ensure accountability for any violations of the rights of civilians, including those with disabilities and who are older, in the conflict. They encouraged civil society, the UN and other agencies, to actively monitor, record and report the situation on the ground., “The best form of civilian protection is to end the war immediately,” the experts said., ENDS, Gerard Quinn*, Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities; Claudia Mahler, Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older persons.*, The Special Rapporteurs are part of what are known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.

Ukraine: Unequal Treatment for Foreigners Attempting to Flee [EN/RU/DE],News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,4 Mar 2022,"Pattern of Blocking, Delaying Non-Ukrainians, (Milan) – Foreigners living in Ukraine have faced unequal treatment and delays as they attempt to flee the war alongside hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, Human Rights Watch said today. Interviews with three dozen foreign nationals, many of them international students, revealed a pattern of blocking or delaying foreigners from boarding buses and trains, apparently to prioritize evacuating Ukrainian women and children., Ukrainian authorities have said they are aware of the problem and are taking steps to ensure that foreign nationals can leave the country. On March 2, 2022 Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba announced on Twitter that the government had established a hotline for foreign students wishing to leave Ukraine., “It’s a harrowing situation for everyone trying to get out of harm’s way, and everyone escaping the war, no matter where they come from, should be allowed to leave,” said Judith Sunderland, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Ukrainian authorities should not discriminate based on nationality or race, and neighboring countries should allow everyone in with a minimum of bureaucracy.”, A week into the invasion, marked by serious violations of the laws of war, one million people have fled across borders into neighboring Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, and Moldova. Everyone is experiencing anguish and hardship as they struggle to find transport to the border, face long lines in freezing weather, and say goodbye to loved ones. Under martial law following the Russian invasion on February 24, Ukrainian men ages 18 to 60 are subject to conscription and are not allowed to leave the country., Ukraine has long been a destination for students and immigrants from around the world. According to government data from 2020, 80,000 international students were in the country, with the largest groups from India, Morocco, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Nigeria. These students, and people from numerous countries who immigrated to Ukraine for work, now find themselves desperately trying to get out of a war zone., The United Nations said there were 752 civilian casualties by March 1, including 227 deaths. It concluded that most were caused by “the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area,” including shelling from heavy artillery, multiple launch rockets, and airstrikes. Human Rights Watch has verified evidence that Russian forces have used cluster munitions and explosive weapons in populated areas, resulting in civilian casualties and extensive damage to civilian infrastructure., Ukrainian authorities should simplify and expedite exit procedures for all those fleeing Ukraine and ensure equal treatment between Ukrainians and non-Ukrainians, Human Rights Watch said. EU agencies should be deployed to assist at borders, and both the EU and Ukraine should ensure basic humanitarian assistance to people stranded in border areas on the Ukrainian side., Human Rights Watch interviewed foreign nationals from North African countries, sub-Saharan African countries, and India at the Polish border, in Lviv, a Ukrainian city about 75 kilometers from the border, and by telephone about the difficulties they faced trying to get out of the country., Barn, a 22-year-old Indian medical student in Dnipro who asked not to use his full name, said the police there wouldn’t let him and six others board the train on February 26. “Four trains came and went and they wouldn’t let us on,” he said. “They [the police] told us that only Ukrainians could take the trains during the day, and foreigners were only allowed on trains at night. We got to the station at 7 a.m. and only finally were allowed on a train at 7:30 p.m.”, A Nigerian student said he was among a group of roughly 20 foreigners, including Ecuadorians and Moroccans, who were forced off a train in Kyiv on February 26. “The police entered and … pulled me and pushed me and asked if I was going to Lviv or Poland. I said Poland and they told me to get out.”, Mourad Hajri, a 22-year-old Moroccan studying veterinary medicine in Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine near Russia, made his way across the country to the border with Poland by train, taxi, and then 11 hours on foot through the night of February 26. “The Ukrainian soldiers and their auxiliaries did not do anything to rein in the chaos,” he said. “All they did was open a way forcefully whenever a bus filled with Ukrainians approached to the border. Those were let in very smoothly and crossed into Poland without a hitch. But for all the others, including us, it was very complicated. You had to fight your way in.”, Rugiatu Faith Maxey, 22, a United States citizen originally from Sierra Leone, was in Ukraine visiting her Sierra Leonian fiancé in Dnipro. She said the driver of a commercial bus announced that “all blacks need to get off the bus” when they approached the border with Poland. She remained on the bus after her group and Ukrainian passengers protested. “Eventually we got through in the line with Ukrainians, but we really had to push for that, and it was helpful that I was American and got the embassy involved,” she said., The African Union issued a statement on February 28 urging “all countries to respect international law and show the same empathy and support to all people fleeing war notwithstanding their racial identity.” Several governments with nationals in Ukraine have expressed concern over their treatment and obstacles to getting out of the country. The Nigerian foreign minister told the media on March 1 that he had spoken with Ukrainian and Polish authorities about the need to ensure that Nigerians could cross the border., At the March 2 General Assembly session, the Indian permanent representative to the United Nations said, “We demand safe and uninterrupted passage for all Indian nationals including our students, particularly from Kharkiv and other conflict zones.” Thousands of Indians have been evacuated after they crossed the border into neighboring countries., On March 3, UN experts expressed “serious concern [about] ongoing reports of people of African descent and racial and ethnic minorities being subjected to discriminatory treatment as they flee Ukraine” and recalled that “[t]he prohibition against racial discrimination is a fundamental right of international law with applicability across situations of conflict and peace.”, Andriy Demchenko, a spokesperson for the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine told Human Rights Watch that allegations of unfair treatment against foreigners “do not correspond with the truth.” He contended that “Ukrainian border guards do not see nationality or color of passports,” and said that nationals from foreign countries “tried to push forward and receive priority treatment.”, On March 1, nine Ukrainian human rights organizations issued a statement calling on officials to “to counter any instances of personal or institutional discrimination, xenophobia or racism,” and on countries of origin and countries neighboring Ukraine to facilitate people leaving the war zone. In a March 1 tweet, Minister Kuleba said that “Africans seeking evacuation are our friends and need to have equal opportunities to return to their home countries safely. Ukraine’s government spares no effort to solve the problem.”, On March 3, EU member states approved the European Commission’s March 2 proposal to trigger for the first time the Temporary Protection Directive, which allows for streamlined, blanket protection for up to three years for people displaced by the war in Ukraine. This will include third-country nationals who are long-term residents of Ukraine and stateless people, as well as Ukrainian nationals., The EU Commission and EU member states should make it clear to Ukrainian authorities that all non-Ukrainian nationals, including people without valid travel documents, are given access to EU territories to either benefit from temporary protection or on humanitarian grounds, including for safe passage or repatriation to their countries of origin, Human Rights Watch said. EU countries should not return to their countries of origin people whose life or freedom would be threatened. Arrangements should be made to ensure an equitable sharing of responsibility by all member states via an efficient and fair relocation plan that takes into account family ties and, insofar as possible, individual preferences., For additional accounts of problems at the border, please see below., Human Rights Watch researchers interviewed 22 people who formed parts of groups totaling 53 people from Morocco, India, Nigeria, Uganda, and Tunisia in and near the train station in Lviv, western Ukraine, as well as by the border with Poland, on February 27 and 28, and on March 3. Most people were interviewed in groups, all of whom confirmed having had the same or similar experiences between February 25 and the date of the interview. Human Rights Watch also interviewed by phone or video three other foreigners trying to leave the country. Some asked not to use their whole names for their safety., Kassim, a 23-year-old Moroccan statistics student, said he and three others were prevented from getting on trains in three cities as they made their way from Odessa to Kyiv and then on to Lviv, near the Polish border:, In Odessa the train controllers said we couldn’t get on the train, they didn’t say why … but we saw they were only letting Ukrainian women and kids on. Finally, after two trains came and went, we were able to get on a train after begging and begging. In Kyiv, again we had to wait for two trains to come and go before we got on, again by begging … We got here to Lviv and wanted to get the train to Poland, but a group of police and military blocked us … They told us that all the foreigners had to get in a separate line … once all the women and kids had boarded, they didn’t let us board next, they made us wait, and as more women and kids came, they let them board until the trains were full., Osamah, 20, also Moroccan, said that he and his traveling companions were unable to get on a train in Lviv because “foreigners are banned from taking the train from here. People say it is only Ukrainians who can travel out of the country.”, Rugiatu Faith Maxey, the United States citizen originally from Sierra Leone, said she, her fiancé, and five others, including a year-old baby, all Africans, walked for 16 hours to the Polish border on their first attempt to get out of Ukraine. Still distant from the border, about two hours in her estimation, they reached an area where people were lining up; a military guard in uniform yelled at them to make sure they got in the line for foreigners. Rugiatu said they spent much of the night waiting in hopes of getting on a bus while watching Ukrainians get rides to the border in military vehicles. She had to be taken to a hospital in an ambulance when she collapsed. They were able to cross the following day., Mourad, the 22-year-old Moroccan veterinary student, fled Kharkiv on February 25 on an overcrowded train to Lviv:, The ride to Lviv lasted 25 hours. There, I met a group of Moroccans, and eight of us took a collective taxi to the polish border post. Around 9 p.m., the taxi dropped us 40 kilometers from the border, saying he couldn’t go further. We were afraid, hungry, and deprived of sleep, but we had no choice other than to walk to the border. That’s what we did, all night., After 11 hours of walking, we arrived at a checkpoint manned by the Ukrainian [border guards] which we were told was 3 kilometers from the Polish border. The Ukrainian soldiers were armed, helped by people in civilian clothes (they wore orange jackets) with truncheons. The civilians were very aggressive, acting like auxiliaries of the military. They and the soldiers were letting Ukrainian citizens pass, but blocking immigrants sporadically. They blocked me and my group for about one-and-a-half hours. I finally managed to sneak out with my friend, then we walked about three kilometers on foot. We were tired and hungry, some Ukrainian civilians helped us with sandwiches and tea., At the border, Mourad found what he described as “total chaos.” Unable to cross there, Mourad eventually went to the border with Hungary, where he and others waited from 3:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. for a bus organized by the Moroccan consulate. He was expecting to take a low-cost flight home arranged by the Moroccan government.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-unequal-treatment-foreigners-attempting-flee-enrude

MRG & partners call on Russia to cease the violence caused by the war against Ukraine,News and Press Release,MRG,Protection and Human Rights,4 Mar 2022,"This statement was delivered by Yulian Kondur and the International Charitable Organization Roma Women Fund 'Chiricli' in the name of MRG and other organizations at the Human Rights Council's Urgent Debate on the situation of human rights in Ukraine stemming from the Russian Aggression, 49th Session, held on Friday 4 March 2022., This statement is delivered on behalf of a Ukrainian and international coalition of Romani human rights defenders and allies[1], to call for peace and solidarity and call on the Russian Federation to cease the violence caused by the war against Ukraine., This war is not only a threat to European security and peace, it comes with violations of international humanitarian and human rights laws under the treaties ratified by Russia. This act of violence has already led to far too many deaths on both sides and continues to force hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian residents, including Roma and other minorities, to seek refuge in neighbouring countries while many others are stuck in conflict zones where missiles, bombs, and attacks are daily occurrence., As members of a global community who has and continues to face far too many tragedies, we wish to express our deep concern regarding the fast escalation of violence and the increasing number of victims this war has already caused., From the Second World War to the Balkan wars of the late 1990s, history has shown us that in times of war or conflict, the plight of Roma as well as other minorities is continuously ignored, rendered invisible and used to further our persecution. In the midst of bombing, firing, and assaults upon cities in Ukraine by the Russian troops, let us not yet again forget that among the families stalled across cities, with no supplies, no electricity, or medical equipment are Roma, people of African descent and other minorities, refugees, migrants and differently abled human beings., As we are witnessing, people of all nations stand in solidarity in countries around the world, let us collectively fight for peace, justice and integrity concretely by:, continuing to unite and take a stand against the horrors of war and violence,, calling on authorities and aid actors to ensure that Roma, minorities and marginalised peoples are granted equal access to protection and safety when seeking refuge, including those without identity documentation., As the Human Rights Council, we ask you to establish a Commission of Inquiry able to monitor the human rights violations and violence experienced by Roma and other minorities who often face double consequences during the war., I thank you., [1] Minority Rights Group International, Minority Rights Group Europe, United Kingdom Central Council for German Sinti and Roma, Germany Roma Active Albania, Albania Art Foundation Jaw Dikh, Poland Amaro Drom e.V., Germany ROMEA, Czech Republic ARA ART, Czech Republic ARA ART SK, Slovakia RomanoNet, Czech Republic KaskoSan Roma Charity, United Kingdom Roma Support Group, United Kingdom Life Together, Czech Republic E-Romnja Association, Romania Regional Roma Educational Youth Association, North Macedonia Amare Phrala -- Our Brothers, Romania Center for Education and Human Rights, Romania",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/mrg-partners-call-russia-cease-violence-caused-war-against-ukraine

Water Sanitation Hygiene",3 Mar 2022,"UNICEF warns of mounting risks for children as conflict intensifies in populated areas, GENEVA, 3 March 2022 – The conflict in Ukraine, now in its second week, is exacting a harrowing toll on children, UNICEF warned today., Millions of children could be caught up in the violence as the fighting intensifies in and around the country’s major urban centres. Children are especially vulnerable to being injured or killed when weapons and explosive munitions are used in populated areas., “The use of explosive weapons in cities could quickly turn this crisis into a catastrophe for Ukraine’s children,” said Afshan Khan, UNICEF’s Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia. “There are no armed operations of this scale that do not result in children being harmed. The consequences will be tragic.”, Since 24 February, 17 children have been killed and 30 have been injured. These are only the reports that the United Nations has been able to verify – the true number of child casualties is likely far higher., The conflict has also sparked massive population displacement that could soon constitute one of Europe’s largest refugee crises since the Second World War. Half a million children have already fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries, with the number of refugees continuing to grow., Hundreds of homes have been damaged or destroyed, and there are reports of schools, orphanages and health centres sustaining heavy damage., Humanitarian needs across the country are multiplying by the hour. Hundreds of thousands of people are without safe drinking water because of damage to water system infrastructure and many have been cut off from access to other essential services like healthcare. The country is running low on critical medical supplies and has had to halt urgent efforts to curb a polio outbreak., UNICEF is working with partners to reach vulnerable children and families with essential services including health, education, protection, water and sanitation., UNICEF is also scaling up its response to meet the urgent needs of children and families crossing into neighbouring countries. These efforts include setting up ‘Blue Dot’ safe spaces along transit routes for children and mothers to access services., UNICEF is appealing for US$276 million for its programmes inside Ukraine and requires an additional US$73 million to assist children in neighbouring countries., “UNICEF is on the ground, doing its best to meet children’s basic needs, but the only way out of the tragedy unfolding in Ukraine is for the conflict to end,” said Khan.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/one-week-conflict-ukraine-half-million-children-become-refugees-enruuk
Mobilising support for the people of Ukraine,News and Press Release,Cordaid,Protection and Human Rights,3 Mar 2022,"As the war continues and intensifies, Cordaid is mobilising support for the people of Ukraine. Both as chair of a Dutch national fundraising campaign, and by supporting Caritas networks who are working around the clock in the war-hit country., ""We all know the future and identity of Europe are at stake in Ukraine. And we desperately call for the atrocities to stop. As humanitarians, our first concern is the suffering of hundreds of thousands of women, children, and men brutally displaced and adrift. And of those in the cities and villages who are desperately seeking safety, food, medical, and other life-saving care. We have to reach out to them. We have to step up our efforts, and we are doing that"", says Cordaid CEO Kees Zevenbergen., Dutch fundraising at its best, Cordaid chairs a Dutch public fundraising campaign in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The campaign is a joint effort of 11 Dutch humanitarian organisations, in close collaboration with national media partners and many others from all corners of Dutch society. It was launched on February 28th and will culminate next week during a live national television event. So far, after only a few days, the campaign yielded more than 9 million euros., Supporting Caritas in Ukraine, Meanwhile, our humanitarian coordinators in the Hague are closely collaborating with Caritas aid workers on the ground in Ukraine, both from Caritas Ukraine (Greek Catholic) and from Caritas Spes (Roman Catholic)., ""Caritas in Ukraine is a very robust and strong network of organisations all over the country. Many of their aid workers and hundreds of volunteers have been delivering assistance in tough conditions ever since the 2014 incursion in Eastern Ukraine. These days they are working around the clock in all parts of the country"", says Cordaid humanitarian aid coordinator Inge Leuverink, who visited Ukraine in 2017., Coping with the predicament of displacement, Cordaid is a contributor to the Caritas emergency response that addresses the essential needs of some 5000 displaced families in the northern, southern, and eastern parts of Ukraine. Caritas staff provides food, water, and hygiene supplies, as well as reliable information., ""Further to that, to cope with the stress of displacement, especially in the harsh winter conditions, people are also offered safe accommodation, to stay, sleep, to eat, and to freshen up"", says Inge Leuverink., Children in institutions, This Caritas emergency response also provides specific assistance for children. Caritas Spes has the facilities and the professionals to provide safe spaces and psycho-social support for children. Ukraine has one of the largest caseloads of children placed in institutions, often in custody of the state, even though many of them have one or two parents. Under the current circumstances of war, they are at great risk of physical harm and trauma. Caritas Spes reaches out to them., Assistance in Kyiv and Ivano Frankivsk, Cordaid has also applied and obtained Dutch relief Alliance funding for an amount of 800.000 euros. With this money, we will support Caritas assistance in Kyiv and Ivano Frankivsk, near the Polish border., “Both host communities and displaced persons in these heavily affected and densely populated parts of Ukraine are lacking everything. They need food, water, hygiene kits, both for adults, children, and babies. They need basic medical items, and items to keep themselves warm. And the elderly and the sick have extra needs. Our support allows Caritas in Ukraine to provide all this to some 7600 people in Kyiv and Ivano Frankivsk”, explains Paul Borsboom, WASH expert with Cordaid., The elderly need special care, ""Among the many Ukrainians that need assistance and our support, the elderly and others who cannot easily fend for themselves need extra care"", Borsboom continues. ""If you're too old to move fast and to seek safety when airstrikes hit, or too sick or impaired, you are more at risk. Caritas has a history and a track record in reaching out to them."", Reaching out and staying safe, As Putin's war intensifies by the day, the risks run by Ukrainian aid workers increase accordingly. Yet they continue, setting up kitchens, protecting kids, making sure people have enough food and water in bomb shelters, reaching out to the displaced. And when air raid sirens go off or airstrikes can be heard, they organize their own protection as well as they can. ""Sorry, I have to go, there is shelling in my village"", one Caritas aid worker texted in haste only yesterday evening., Especially in Eastern Ukraine, many aid workers have been used to wearing flak jackets and other protective gear for years. ""These days, all over the country, they are organizing their own safety and security in the best possible way. Stretching the limits of courage, while at the same time reducing risks"", Leuverink says., ""The aggressor cannot destroy our aspirations"", Fr. Vyacheslav Grynevych, head of Caritas Spes, recently wrapped up the situation in a moving manner: ""The aggressor is destroying our villages, our houses, even our kindergartens. But he is not able to destroy our aspirations for peace and freedom. We will all courageously continue to help people.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/mobilising-support-people-ukraine
"Ukraine: Amid mounting human cost, parties must uphold international humanitarian law [EN/RU]",News and Press Release,ICRC,Protection and Human Rights,4 Mar 2022,"A statement from ICRC President Peter Maurer Geneva (ICRC) – We are seeing a devastating humanitarian crisis unfold in Ukraine. Today, the ICRC is urgently reminding the parties to the conflict to fulfil their legal obligations to avoid further civilian suffering and loss of life., The Geneva Conventions and their First Additional Protocol are fully applicable in the international armed conflict taking place in Ukraine., Parties to that conflict must therefore respect the set of rules they have committed to that protect people during conflict. That means sparing the civilian population from military operations. They should also immediately allow safe passage for people fleeing the fighting., To alleviate suffering and protect the population, the ICRC is determined to fulfil in Ukraine the mandate the nations of the world gave us seven decades ago in the Geneva Conventions. That work must be facilitated right now - when fighting is causing massive humanitarian needs –not delayed until a potential future cease-fire. Parties have the obligation to facilitate that work even as conflict rages., Our demand today could not be more urgent. ICRC teams are receiving a flood of calls from people desperate for safety., Casualty figures keep rising while health facilities struggle to cope. Civilians staying in underground shelters tell us that they fled shells falling directly overhead., They have no extra clothes, supplies or their needed medication. They need assistance now., I'm heartened to see the enormous courage and dedication of the humanitarian volunteers of the Ukrainian Red Cross. The ICRC and wider International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement are responding in Ukraine and surrounding countries. Our people are ready and determined to visit detainees, reconnect separated families, support healthcare facilities and increase the lifesaving assistance already being provided., Nearly 75 years ago, the nations of the world agreed to basic tenets of humanity during armed conflict. Today, we issue a reminder of what those rules are:, International humanitarian law and the protection of civilians, The ICRC is concerned that fighting in urban settings entails particularly grave risks for civilians., Attacks against civilians and civilian objects, indiscriminate attacks and disproportionate attacks are prohibited. Parties must take feasible precautions to avoid or minimize civilian harm. They must do everything in their power to avoid locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas and protect civilians against the effects of attacks. Civilians should be allowed to leave in search of safety should they wish to do so., Civilian infrastructure, It is imperative that civilian infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, water facilities and electricity, is actively protected and not attacked, whether by kinetic or cyber means. The use of illegal weapons and the illegal use of weapons is prohibited. The use of heavy explosive weapons in populated areas should be avoided, as it carries with it a high likelihood of indiscriminate effects., To protect civilians, combatants must distinguish themselves from civilians in all military operations by wearing identifiable insignia and carrying arms openly. They must respect international humanitarian law., Access to health care, safety of medical workers, return of mortal remains, The sick and wounded must be cared for, regardless of whose side they are on. Medical workers, medical vehicles and hospitals dedicated to humanitarian work cannot be attacked. Parties to the conflict must also facilitate the recovery, identification and dignified management of the deceased and facilitate the return of the remains of the deceased upon request of the side to which they belong; the ICRC can act as a neutral intermediary., Protected persons, including prisoners of war and detainees, Each party to the conflict must take the necessary measures to account for protected persons in its power – the wounded, sick and dead military personnel, prisoners of war and protected civilians deprived of their liberty. It must collect, centralize and transmit the required information to the other side through the ICRC's Central Tracing Agency acting as a neutral intermediary., Prisoners of war and detained civilians must be treated with dignity and are absolutely protected against ill-treatment and exposure to public curiosity including images circulating publicly on social media. The 1949 Geneva Conventions ensures the ICRC access to detainees – both prisoners of war and civilians., Safe access for humanitarian work, All parties and all states must allow and facilitate the work of impartial humanitarian organisations, such as the Red Cross and Red Crescent. Our work is to save lives. Sanctions and other restrictive measures must be designed to allow humanitarian action to freely occur., For more information, please contact:, Jason Straziuso, ICRC Geneva Tel.: +41 79 949 35 12 jstraziuso@icrc.org, Ewan Watson, ICRC Geneva Tel.: +41 79 244 64 70 ewatson@icrc.org, Crystal Wells, ICRC Geneva Tel.: +41 79 642 80 56 cwells@icrc.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-amid-mounting-human-cost-parties-must-uphold-international-humanitarian-law
Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (March 2022),News and Press Release,OCHA,Humanitarian Financing,4 Mar 2022,"The Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) is one of the quickest, most effective ways to directly support the most urgent, lifesaving humanitarian relief in Ukraine., The UHF was created in 2019 by the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC) to make funding directly available to the best-placed and most effective humanitarian partners operating inside Ukraine., Ukraine’s security and humanitarian situation is deteriorating rapidly since the beginning of military operations on 24 February 2022. The UHF is a critically important channel to support in-country relief operations and ensure that urgently needed humanitarian assistance reaches the people in Ukraine who need it most., Funding life-saving action, Donations to the UHF are collected into a single fund and made available locally to a range of carefully vetted and trusted relief partners who are on the ground, at the front lines of the response and closest to people in need., These partners prioritize the most urgent assistance together and make sure that UHF funds go to the most important emergency response activities at the right time., Partners include UN agencies, national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and Red Cross/Red Crescent organizations. They are all committed to staying and delivering assistance and protection to the people of Ukraine., Together, and with UHF support, they deliver health care, food aid, clean water, shelter and other humanitarian assistance for millions of people in need inside Ukraine., An inclusive and transparent process ensures that resources focus on the highest priority needs. This means that funding decisions empower local partners and humanitarian leadership, and lead to better collaboration and collective ownership of the emergency response.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-fund-march-2022
Ukraine: Cluster Munitions Launched Into Kharkiv Neighborhoods [EN/DE],News and Press Release,HRW,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",4 Mar 2022,"Russian Forces’ Indiscriminate Attacks May Amount to War Crimes, Russian forces fired cluster munitions into at least three residential areas in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, on February 28, 2022, Human Rights Watch said today. These attacks killed at least three civilians., Interviews with 2 witnesses and an analysis of 40 videos and photographs reveal the use of submunitions delivered by Russian-made 9M55K Smerch cluster munition rockets. The United Nations reported nine civilian deaths and 37 injuries in attacks across the city that day., “Kharkiv is under relentless attack from Russian forces and civilians are hiding in basements to evade explosions and debris,” said Steve Goose, arms director at Human Rights Watch. “Using cluster munitions in populated areas shows a brazen and callous disregard for people’s lives.”, Cluster munitions open in the air and disperse dozens, or even hundreds, of small submunitions over a large area. They often fail to explode on initial impact, leaving unexploded submunition duds that act like landmines if they are touched., The use of inherently indiscriminate weapons in populated areas is prohibited under international humanitarian law, the laws that govern the conduct of war. An international treaty bans cluster munitions because of their widespread indiscriminate effect and long-lasting danger to civilians. Russia and Ukraine are not state parties to this treaty., Given the inherently indiscriminate nature of cluster munitions and their foreseeable effects on civilians, their use as documented in Kharkiv might constitute a war crime., On March 2, a group of ICC member countries referred the situation in Ukraine to the court’s prosecutor for investigation. The prosecutor subsequently stated that his office would immediately proceed with a Ukraine inquiry., Human Rights Watch verified and analyzed 25 videos and photographs posted on social media showing the 3 attacks or their immediate aftermath in the north, northeast, and southeast areas of the city and another 15 images taken by 2 witnesses after one of the attacks in the Shevchenkivskyi district., The two witnesses, interviewed separately, said that they were not aware of any Ukrainian military activity in the area prior to the attack. An open-source online map shows an area labeled as belonging to the military about 400 meters from where the cargo section of one of the rockets landed. Satellite imagery from February 20 shows a small compound at that location with about 20 military vehicles. Even if the site served a military function, the use of cluster munitions in a residential area with civilians violates the prohibition on indiscriminate attacks., Under the laws of war, parties to the conflict must avoid locating military objectives near densely populated areas and endeavor to remove civilians from the vicinity of military activities. However, the attacking party is not relieved of its obligation to take into account the risk to civilians, nor of the obligation not to use inherently indiscriminate weapons because it considers the defending party responsible for having located legitimate military targets within or near populated areas., One of the videos analyzed, posted to Telegram at 11:29 a.m. local time on February 28, shows multiple explosions consistent with the use of cluster munitions in the northeastern Moskovskyi district. Two more videos, one posted to Telegram at 12:55 p.m. that day and one posted to Twitter at 2:23 p.m., recorded from the center of the city toward the Shevchenkivskyi district, show similar explosions., The explosion signatures and rocket remnants found in the vicinity of the attacks confirm that the explosions were from submunitions delivered by 9M55K Smerch cluster munition rockets. The launcher for these rockets, a BM-30, has 12 barrels and the rockets are often fired in volleys. Each 9M55K cluster munition rocket contains 72 9N235 fragmentation submunitions., Another video posted on Telegram, recorded by a security camera in the southeastern Industrialnyi district, shows at least 15 consecutive explosions in a residential street that are consistent with submunitions. The footage shows a time stamp of 10:42 a.m. on February 28. In the video, at least four people in civilian clothes can be seen on a path diving to take cover. Several cars are hit, setting one of them ablaze., Human Rights Watch spoke by telephone with a man living in the Shevchenkivskyi district near where the attack took place, an area with at least three preschools, three schools, and a large hospital. He said that he was walking with his wife to a shop near his home on Balakiryeva Street at around 10 a.m. on February 28, when he saw what he believed to be a Grad rocket flying overhead from the north., “My wife and I entered the basement of an apartment block and around 50 other people were sheltering there,” he said. “The whole building was shaking.”, A photograph that the man took and sent to Human Rights Watch shows the empty cargo section of a 9M55K Smerch cluster munition rocket on Balakiryeva Street., Another man interviewed by phone said that he was in his apartment close to Serpnya 23 Street, about one kilometer from Balakiryeva Street, preparing food when he heard large detonations and went to the basement for cover. “The bangs lasted for about two minutes,” he said. “When I went out, I saw three covered bodies lying in the street and one wounded person being taken away by emergency services.”, The man said he saw many damaged cars, two or three of which were burned, and pockmarks on the street about 15 meters apart, as well as four small, unexploded bombs., The man sent Human Rights Watch 13 photographs that he said he took, which showed unexploded submunitions and splattered impact patterns on the ground consistent with submunition detonations. Human Rights Watch determined that the photographs were taken between Serpnya 23 Lane and Serpnya 23 Street., Human Rights Watch also verified three videos posted to Telegram that were recorded 150 meters east of the attack location on Serpnya 23 Lane. All the videos show four people lying on the ground, at least three of whom appear to be dead., Human Rights Watch verified three other videos and a photograph posted on Telegram from Klochkivska Street, a main street in the Shevchenkivskyi district about 2.5 kilometers from Balakirjeva Street. The first video, recorded from outside a grocery store, shows a rocket hitting the street and people running away. The photograph posted later shows what appears to be the same rocket remnant embedded in the sidewalk., The other two videos, recorded from the same location, show blood on the pavement and a woman lying on the ground with a makeshift tourniquet around her left leg. One of the videos also shows the expended propulsion section of a Smerch rocket and fragmentation damage consistent with that created by a 9N235 submunition., Human Rights Watch collected and verified another four photographs and two videos from Telegram and Twitter showing explosions, damage to buildings, and cars on fire caused by the cluster munitions attack in the Industrialnyi District. Another four photos and four videos posted on the same platforms show damage to other buildings in the area., On February 24, a Russian ballistic missile carrying a cluster munition struck just outside a hospital in Vuhledar, a town in the Ukrainian government-controlled Donetska region, killing four civilians and injuring another ten, six of them healthcare workers., “We are seeing mounting evidence of indiscriminate attacks on Kharkiv and the price civilians are paying for these serious violations,” said Goose. “If these deadly acts were carried out either intentionally or recklessly, they would be war crimes.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-cluster-munitions-launched-kharkiv-neighborhoods-ende

The URCS, with the support of the Red Cross Movement, has provided lifesaving assistance as follows:, More than 30,000 people have already received humanitarian aid from the Red Cross emergency stockpile: including hygiene and food kits, warm clothing and medicine., Ukraine Red Cross Rapid Response Units are, providing support to fire brigades and State Emergency Services in repairing damage to civilian buildings and infrastructure. More than 50 lives have been saved during this time., on duty at congested border crossing points: arranging places for mothers and children; providing water, food and hygiene items; supporting people with first aid and psychological first aid on a 24/7 basis., assisting in evacuation of civilians from places where shelling takes place., organising collection points for essentials in the regions to be handed over to those who need them now: clothes, food, hygiene items, drinks, bed linen, blankets, etc., distributing food and water to 8,000 people taking shelter in Kyiv’s metro stations and 4,000 people staying in shelters in Mariupol., Red Cross Societies in neighbouring countries such as Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Hungary and Slovakia have provided humanitarian support at the border, distributing food items, water, non-food items, hygiene products, and communication services, where over 500,000 people have fled Ukraine., Mr Benjamin William, Secretary General and CEO of Singapore Red Cross, said, “I am heartened to see the outpouring of support from the people of Singapore for our humanitarian response to the crisis in Ukraine. It is a show of solidarity with the communities suffering heavy casualties in Ukraine.”, “Our team has been working closely with the Ukrainian Red Cross, IFRC and other National Societies to provide assistance to address the most pressing needs. Much of the focus will be on the vulnerable, including children (many who are unaccompanied), single women with children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. The combination of an active and bloody conflict, extreme cold weather and Covid-19 means that for the people in the conflict regions and those who have been displaced from their homes (already exceeding 1 million), the days ahead will be a struggle for survival. The essential needs continue to increase day by day. Only through the collaborative effort of many parties, including we in Singapore, can we effectively reach out to meet the needs of the affected persons and communities.”, OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FROM COMMUNITY, In Singapore, donations to the SRC fundraising appeal have reached about S$2 million. This includes the Singapore Government’s contribution of US$100,000 to the humanitarian operations., Corporate organisations including Credence and Frasers Property have launched employee giving initiatives; Frasers Property has also made an outright donation. Revolut is making it easy for their community to donate via their apps. Home-based bakery Little Beauties Bakes is donating sale proceeds of baked goods, whilst some students are selling accessories in school to raise funds., The key challenges in delivering humanitarian aid include logistical limitations and disrupted supply chains. Unsolicited in-kind donations for Ukraine remain a challenge for the Red Cross Societies on the ground to handle, exacerbating capacity to store, transport and distribute it. Red Cross encourages monetary donations as cash can be used to purchase items more quickly at nearby unaffected regions, thereby enhancing flexibility in the Red Cross response coordination at this time of need., The Red Cross reiterates our call for unhindered access to civilians for Humanitarian Aid. In line with universally accepted International Humanitarian Law, the Red Cross has called for the protection of non-combatants and critical infrastructure such as water and power systems in Ukraine, so that all humanitarian actors, including the Red Cross, will be able to have access to civilians needing help., The Singapore Red Cross has activated its “Restoring Family Links” (RFL) service to assist Singapore residents to locate their immediate family members who may have been affected by the disasters with whom they have difficulty in contacting.

Europe at a turning point: Oxfam reaction to temporary protection directive proposal,News and Press Release,Oxfam,Protection and Human Rights,3 Mar 2022,"Today, EU migration ministers meet to discuss the Commission’s proposal to activate the temporary protection directive for people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine. If activated, the directive would allow those fleeing from Ukraine, access to a residence permit for up to three years along with access to education and employment in any EU country., In just one week, more than a million people have fled Ukraine into Poland, Hungary, Romania, Moldova and surrounding countries. The number is only expected to rise sharply in the following weeks., Evelien van Roemburg, Oxfam EU Head of Office, said:, “The significance of this moment for Europe cannot be underestimated. The Commission’s proposal offers a direct lifeline to people fleeing from danger in Ukraine. It would also kick-start a solidarity mechanism that asks all EU countries to share the responsibility for hosting them., “The European Union has a particularly poor track record on the latter though: since 2015, the EU and its member states have consistently failed to agree on any type of mandatory responsibility-sharing mechanism., “It is impossible to expect Ukraine’s immediate neighbors to alone bear the responsibility of hosting over a million people now, let alone the likelihood of so many more to come. All EU member states need to chip in and take responsibility., “In the past years, we have seen asylum seekers’ rights being systematically ignored, a crackdown on NGO workers who are giving them aid and support, overcrowded and unsuitable camps, and often violent pushbacks. This is a reality of recent European history that we cannot see repeated., “We are therefore at a turning point for Europe. It is not possible to remedy the wrongs from the past, but we can do much better in the future. The EU counties must agree with this proposal ―quickly, in full, and implement it immediately. We need real responsibility-sharing across all of Europe, ensuring that people have decent and dignified conditions to live in and can rebuild their lives in safety. It also means keeping borders open to all people fleeing violence, persecution, and war regardless of the country they came from.”, Notes to editors, The EU's current asylum rules state that refugees must apply for asylum in the first EU country they arrive. This system collapsed in 2015 when millions of people fled to Europe seeking safety., The Temporary Protection Directive from 2001 has never been triggered so far. It is an exceptional measure to provide immediate and temporary protection to displaced persons, and is applied when the standard asylum system is struggling to cope with a mass influx of people needing protection. The Directive obliges all EU member states to provide minimum protection, including a residency permit for up to 3 years, access to employment, accommodation, social welfare, education, etc. The solidarity mechanism in the Directive is based on a voluntary offer from states and the consent of the person concerned. Read here more about it., Read our 2021 report: ""Tipping the Scales: the role of responsibility and solidarity sharing in the situation on the Greek islands"". It details how failed EU policies and the shirking of responsibilities resulted in the abysmal situation in Greece, and how the current proposals replicate these failed policies and allow for the same shirking of responsibility., Read our reaction to the crisis in Ukraine: “Protection of civilians in Ukraine conflict.”, Contact information, Jade Tenwick in Belgium | jade.tenwick@oxfam.org | +32 473 56 22 60

"Ukraine : 752 victimes civiles confirmées au 1er mars, dont 227 tués, et plus de deux millions de personnes contraintes de fuir: tel est le bilan provisoire dressé par Mme Bachelet à l’ouverture du débat urgent du Conseil des droits de l’homme",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,3 Mar 2022,"Cet après-midi, le Conseil des droits de l’homme a ouvert son débat urgent sur « la situation des droits de l’homme en Ukraine résultant de l’agression russe » en entendant des déclarations de la Haute-Commissaire des Nations Unies aux droits de l'homme, Mme Michelle Bachelet, et du Président du Comité de coordination des procédures spéciales (du Conseil), M. Victor Madrigal-Borloz. Ils ont tous deux dressé le même bilan, basé sur les chiffres de mardi soir [1er mars] du Haut-Commissariat aux droits de l’homme, qui font état de 752 victimes civiles confirmées, dont 227 tués – parmi lesquels 15 enfants – et au moins 525 blessés, dont 28 enfants. Les chiffres exacts seront bien plus élevés, car de nombreuses autres pertes attendent d’être confirmées, ont-ils souligné., Selon les estimations du Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés (HCR), plus de deux millions de personnes ont été contraintes de fuir leur domicile, a ajouté Mme Bachelet. Un million de personnes, selon les estimations du HCR, sont déplacées à l’intérieur du pays et plus d’un million de réfugiés (1 040 000) ont cherché refuge dans les pays voisins ces sept derniers jours, a-t-elle précisé, avant de souligner que le HCR estime que jusqu’à quatre millions de personnes pourraient quitter le pays dans les semaines à venir si le conflit se poursuit., Mme Bachelet a affirmé que l'attaque militaire de la Fédération de Russie contre l'Ukraine lancée le 24 février dernier avait ouvert un « nouveau et dangereux chapitre de l'histoire du monde ». Elle a déploré que la plupart des pertes civiles aient été causées par le recours à l'artillerie lourde, à des systèmes de lance-roquettes multiples et à des frappes aériennes dans des zones peuplées, avec des rapports préoccupants faisant état de l’utilisation d’armes à sous-munitions frappant des cibles civiles., Des dizaines de millions de personnes restent en Ukraine, potentiellement en danger de mort, a rappelé la Haute-Commissaire, avant de se dire profondément préoccupée que l’escalade actuelle des opérations militaires n’aggrave encore les souffrances auxquelles ces personnes sont confrontées. Mme Bachelet a souhaité se faire l’écho de l’appel lancé hier par l’Assemblée générale des Nations Unies en faveur d’une résolution immédiate du conflit par des moyens pacifiques. Elle a en outre fermement exhorté à la pleine protection des civils, ainsi que des soldats capturés, comme l’exige le droit humanitaire international., Cette attaque militaire russe viole de manière flagrante le droit international et frappe au cœur même de l'esprit et de l'objet de la Charte des Nations Unies, a souligné M. Madrigal-Borloz. Il a indiqué qu’en tant qu'experts des droits de l'homme, ses collègues et lui exhortent la Fédération de Russie à respecter le droit international; à mettre fin aux hostilités immédiatement et sans condition ; à cesser immédiatement toutes les violations des droits de l'homme résultant de l'attaque ; à permettre aux défenseurs des droits de l'homme en Ukraine et en Fédération de Russie de mener à bien leur travail pacifique ; à faciliter l'acheminement immédiat et sans entrave de l'aide humanitaire sans aucune discrimination ; et à restaurer la capacité du peuple en Ukraine d’exercer ses droits de l’homme et ses libertés fondamentales sans ingérence militaire ou extérieure., Le Président du Comité de coordination a dit compter sur le leadership du Conseil pour veiller à ce que l'accent mis actuellement sur la situation d'urgence ne détourne pas l'attention des libertés de réunion, d'association et d'expression en Fédération de Russie même, alors que des informations suggèrent que quelque 7000 personnes ont été arrêtées depuis jeudi dernier., Le Conseil a ensuite entendu une déclaration de la Fédération de Russie dont le Représentant permanent auprès des Nations Unies à Genève a notamment interpellé les États-Unis et l’Union européenne en leur demandant « dans lequel des documents internationaux relatifs aux droits de l'homme auxquels [ils sont] parties est-il écrit que la fourniture d'armes létales contribue à sauver des vies humaines ? ». C’est très simple, leur a-t-il également lancé, « le régime fantoche de Zelensky ne vous intéresse que comme outil de pression et monnaie d'échange dans votre confrontation avec la Russie »., S’exprimant à son tour, la Vice-Ministre des affaires étrangères de l’Ukraine a souligné que, pendant que la police russe jette en prison des centaines de Russes qui osent dire non à la guerre, des millions d’Ukrainiens résistent, luttent contre les tanks à main nue, servent volontairement de boucliers humains pour protéger une centrale nucléaire. Les bombes russes détruisent villes et villages, églises, musées, parcs et infrastructures critiques, a-t-elle insisté. « C’est un moment de vérité non seulement pour l’Ukraine, qui tente de survivre, mais pour tout le système international des droits de l’homme et ses institutions », a-t-elle averti., Des déclarations ont ensuite été faites par de très nombreuses délégations* qui ont pris part au débat*., Le Conseil poursuivra ce débat urgent demain matin, à partir de 10 heures, avant de se prononcer sur le projet de résolution dont il est saisi à ce titre., Débat urgent sur la situation des droits de l’homme en Ukraine résultant de l’agression russe, Déclarations liminaires, MME MICHELLE BACHELET, Haute-Commissaire des Nations Unies aux droits de l'homme, a souligné qu’il y a une semaine, l’attaque militaire lancée par la Fédération de Russie sur l’Ukraine avait ouvert un nouveau et dangereux chapitre dans l’histoire mondiale. Cette attaque, qui a débuté le 24 février, a un impact énorme sur les droits de millions de personnes à travers l’Ukraine, a-t-elle ajouté, avant de faire observer que les niveaux de menace élevés pour les armes nucléaires soulignent la gravité des risques pour l'ensemble de l'humanité., Mme Bachelet a indiqué que les opérations militaires continuent de s’intensifier dans les principales villes et autour, notamment à Tchernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Lyssytchansk, Sievierodonetsk, Soumy, Marioupol, Jytomyr, ainsi que dans la capitale, Kiev. La ville de Volnovakha, dans la région de Donetsk, a été presque entièrement détruite, a ajouté la Haute-Commissaire. Elle a précisé que les chiffres de mardi soir [1er mars] du Haut-Commissariat aux droits de l’homme font état de 752 victimes civiles confirmées, dont 227 tués – parmi lesquels 15 enfants – et au moins 525 blessés, dont 28 enfants. Quelques 323 de ces 752 victimes – 65 tués et 258 blessés – ont été enregistrées dans les régions de Donetsk et de la Lougansk, et le reste dans les autres régions de l’Ukraine. Les chiffres exacts seront bien plus élevés, car de nombreuses autres pertes attendent d’être confirmées, a souligné la Haute-Commissaire. « Nous pleurons tous les décès qui se sont produits », a-t-elle déclaré. Elle a déploré que la plupart des pertes civiles aient été causées par le recours à l'artillerie lourde, à des systèmes de lance-roquettes multiples et à des frappes aériennes dans des zones peuplées, avec des rapports préoccupants faisant état de l’utilisation d’armes à sous-munitions frappant des cibles civiles. Des dommages massifs ont été infligés à des bâtiments résidentiels, a insisté Mme Bachelet. « L’utilisation d’armes ayant des effets sur de vastes zones dans des zones urbaines densément peuplées est par nature aveugle et je demande la cessation immédiate d’une telle force », a affirmé la Haute-Commissaire. Des dommages substantiels ont été infligés à un grand nombre de biens civils, y compris des hôpitaux et des écoles, et des infrastructures essentielles ont été endommagées, coupant la fourniture de services essentiels tels que l’électricité, l’eau et l’accès aux soins de santé, a-t-elle indiqué. Le 26 février, des troupes russes près de Kherson auraient tiré sur une ambulance qui transportait des victimes gravement blessées ; le conducteur a été tué et un agent de santé blessé, a ajouté Mme Bachelet., Selon les estimations du Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés (HCR), plus de deux millions de personnes ont été contraintes de fuir leur domicile. Un million de personnes, selon les estimations du HCR, sont déplacées à l’intérieur du pays et plus d’un million de réfugiés (1 040 000) ont cherché refuge dans les pays voisins ces sept derniers jours, a précisé Mme Bachelet. Le HCR estime que jusqu’à quatre millions de personnes pourraient quitter le pays dans les semaines à venir si le conflit se poursuit, a ajouté la Haute-Commissaire aux droits de l’homme, avant de saluer l’accueil que les Ukrainiens qui quittent le pays ont reçu. Cet accueil doit être étendu à tous ceux qui fuient le conflit, quels que soient leur citoyenneté, leur appartenance ethnique et leur statut, migratoire ou autre. Il y a eu des indications troublantes de discrimination à l'encontre de ressortissants africains et asiatiques qui fuyaient l’Ukraine et le Haut-Commissariat aux droits de l’homme scrutera cette situation avec attention, a indiqué Mme Bachelet., Des dizaines de millions de personnes restent en Ukraine, potentiellement en danger de mort, a poursuivi la Haute-Commissaire, avant de se dire profondément préoccupée que l’escalade actuelle des opérations militaires n’aggrave encore les souffrances auxquelles ces personnes sont confrontées. Le personnel du Haut-Commissariat aux droits de l’homme en Ukraine a été contacté par plusieurs groupes – notamment des membres de la communauté des Tatars de Crimée en Ukraine continentale (mainland Ukraine) ainsi que d’éminents défenseurs des droits de l’homme et journalistes – qui craignent d’être persécutés si les troupes russes avancent., Mme Bachelet a souhaité se faire l’écho de l’appel lancé hier par l’Assemblée générale des Nations Unies en faveur d’une résolution immédiate du conflit par des moyens pacifiques. Les États doivent se conformer au droit international et il est impératif de permettre le plein accès pour l’acheminement de l'aide humanitaire aux civils dans l'ensemble du pays, a-t-elle déclaré. Elle a fermement exhorté à la pleine protection des civils, ainsi que des soldats capturés, comme l’exige le droit humanitaire international., La Haute-Commissaire a par ailleurs noté que la Cour internationale de justice a officiellement été saisie de procédures liées au conflit et qu’elle entamera la semaine prochaine des audiences sur une demande de mesures provisoires. D’autre part, le Procureur de la Cour pénale internationale a annoncé sa décision de procéder immédiatement à des enquêtes actives sur la situation en Ukraine, suite aux saisines émanant d’un grand nombre d’Etats. Quant au Conseil des droits de l’homme, a souligné Mme Bachelet, il est saisi d’une importante proposition qui vise à élargir les voies de l’obligation redditionnelle au travers d’une commission d’enquête internationale indépendante., Mme Bachelet a rappelé que ces huit dernières années, le Haut-Commissariat avait surveillé de manière approfondie et régulière la situation des droits de l’homme en Ukraine, en se concentrant sur les régions du Donbass engagées dans le conflit ainsi que sur la République autonome de Crimée et la ville de Sébastopol occupées par la Fédération de Russie depuis 2014. Les 40 rapports publiés par le Haut-Commissariat sont accessibles au public ; ils documentent les violations du droit international relatif aux droits de l’homme et au droit humanitaire par de multiples acteurs sur cette période, a rappelé Mme Bachemet. Elle a, à cet égard, précisé que les observateurs des droits de l’homme du Haut-Commissariat continueront à opérer à travers le pays dans toute la mesure de leurs capacités. Cette crise démontre l’importance vitale de notre surveillance objective et de nos rapports objectifs en Ukraine, a souligné Mme Bachelet. Elle a conclu son propos en exprimant son soutien aux personnes qui souffrent de privations, de douleurs et de peurs insupportables en raison de la destruction insensée de la guerre., M. VICTOR MADRIGAL-BORLOZ, Président du Comité de coordination des procédures spéciales (du Conseil des droits de l’homme) a déclaré qu’alors que le monde continue d’assister, désespéré, à l’impact désastreux de l’attaque militaire de la Fédération de Russie sur l’Ukraine, les titulaires de mandat au titre des procédures spéciales du Conseil qu’il représente ici saluent la décision du Conseil de tenir ce débat urgent. A la suite de la décision historique de l'Assemblée générale de déplorer dans les termes les plus vifs l'agression de la Fédération de Russie contre l'Ukraine en violation de l'article 2 de la Charte, il appartient maintenant à ce Conseil d'inscrire « pleinement » les droits de l'homme dans la réponse à la crise et de contribuer à un cessez-le-feu immédiat, à une désescalade des tensions et à un retour résolu à la diplomatie et au dialogue. Les titulaires de mandat sont « prêts » à continuer d'aider le Conseil et les parties concernées, aujourd'hui et dans les semaines à venir, a-t-il indiqué., M. Madrigal-Borloz a ensuite rappelé que lundi dernier, quelque 63 experts des droits de l'homme nommés par le Conseil des droits de l’homme, ainsi que les présidents de six des organes conventionnels des droits de l'homme des Nations Unies ont exprimé, à l'unisson, leur « profonde indignation » et leur « détresse » face à « l'agression perpétrée par les forces de la Fédération de Russie à l’encontre de la souveraineté et de l'intégrité territoriale de l'Ukraine et de toutes les personnes se trouvant sous juridiction ukrainienne ». Cette attaque militaire, qui viole de manière flagrante le droit international et frappe au cœur même de l'esprit et de l'objet de la Charte des Nations Unies, est fondamentalement une atteinte à l'ordre qui permet à notre travail de faire avancer les droits de l'homme et leur objectif de promouvoir le respect de la dignité humaine, a déclaré le Président du Comité de coordination des procédures spéciales., M. Madrigal-Borloz a ensuite repris à l’identique les chiffres relatifs au bilan des victimes que la Haute-Commissaire vient de présenter dans sa déclaration [ci-dessus]. La plupart de ces victimes ont été causées par l'utilisation d'armes explosives à large zone d'impact, a-t-il lui aussi fait observer, avant de souligner, à son tour, que le nombre réel de victimes est probablement beaucoup plus élevé. « Nous condamnons avec la plus grande fermeté ces graves violations du droit à la vie, à la liberté et à la sécurité », a déclaré M. Madrigal-Borloz. Les effets catastrophiques et traumatiques des déplacements forcés et de la destruction des infrastructures essentielles s’étendront sur des générations, en particulier pour les enfants pour lesquels le traumatisme risque de durer toute une vie, a-t-il insisté., L’espoir des procédures spéciales est que ce Conseil jouera le rôle qui lui revient en plaçant et en maintenant les droits de l'homme au centre de la réponse par une série de mesures concrètes. Le Conseil pourra, notamment, engager tous les efforts nécessaires pour garantir l’obligation redditionnelle due, à partir d'une approche fondée sur des preuves. Il faut s'attendre à ce que vos procédures spéciales reçoivent des informations importantes sur la manière dont le coût humain doit être évalué au regard des normes du droit international relatif aux droits de l'homme, a souligné M. Madrigal-Borloz à l’intention des délégations. De leur côté, a-t-il poursuivi, les procédures spéciales appellent tous les membres de la communauté internationale, en particulier ceux qui fournissent un soutien et un abri aux personnes fuyant le conflit, à respecter le principe fondamental de non-discrimination. Nous sommes profondément troublés, par exemple, que des femmes et des enfants puissent être affectés de manière disproportionnée par cette guerre et que des ressortissants de pays tiers puissent faire l'objet d'un traitement discriminatoire lorsqu'ils fuient le conflit et se voir refuser l'accès à une assistance essentielle, a indiqué M. Madrigal-Borloz. D’autre part, a-t-il ajouté, les entreprises, y compris les entreprises technologiques et celles qui ont des usines dans un contexte de conflit, devraient être appelées à s'engager dans une diligence raisonnable accrue en matière de droits de l'homme, conformément aux Principes directeurs des Nations Unies sur les entreprises et les droits de l'homme. Par ailleurs, dans cette approche globale fondée sur les droits de l’homme, aussi longtemps que cela sera faisable, les voix et le savoir de la société civile et des défenseurs des droits de l’homme ukrainiens doivent se voir accorder une place fondamentale, a indiqué M. Madrigal-Borloz., M. Madrigal-Borloz s’est en outre fait l’écho des mots prononcés par le Secrétaire général à l'Assemblée générale, indiquant que nous sommes confrontés à ce qui pourrait devenir « la pire crise humanitaire et de réfugiés en Europe depuis des décennies ». Il a ici aussi repris les chiffres mentionnés par la Haute-Commissaire dans sa déclaration devant le Conseil cet après-midi (voir ci-dessus)., Le Président du Comité de coordination a également dit compter sur le leadership du Conseil pour veiller à ce que l'accent mis actuellement sur la situation d'urgence ne détourne pas l'attention des libertés de réunion, d'association et d'expression en Fédération de Russie même. Des informations suggèrent que quelque 7000 personnes ont été arrêtées depuis jeudi dernier, a indiqué M. Madrigal-Borloz, appelant à ce que toutes les personnes arrêtées et détenues soient traitées conformément aux obligations internationales de la Fédération de Russie en matière de droits humains et soient libérées sans plus tarder. Il a par ailleurs indiqué que la menace que fait peser sur l’environnement le conflit armé, avec des zones qui seraient contaminées par des radiations, est également source de profonde préoccupation., M. Madrigal-Borloz a exhorté la Fédération de Russie à écouter les voix collectives de la communauté internationale – laquelle s'exprime maintenant unanimement pour dire sans équivoque que ces actions militaires sont inacceptables pour tous., En tant qu'experts des droits de l'homme, mes collègues et moi exhortons la Fédération de Russie à respecter le droit international; à mettre fin aux hostilités immédiatement et sans condition ; à cesser immédiatement toutes les violations des droits de l'homme résultant de l'attaque ; à permettre aux défenseurs des droits de l'homme en Ukraine et en Fédération de Russie de mener à bien leur travail pacifique ; à faciliter l'acheminement immédiat et sans entrave de l'aide humanitaire sans aucune discrimination ; et à restaurer la capacité du peuple en Ukraine d’exercer ses droits de l’homme et ses libertés fondamentales sans ingérence militaire ou extérieure, a conclu M. Madrigal-Borloz., Pays concernés, M. GENNADY GATILOV, Représentant permanent de la Fédération de Russie auprès des Nations Unies à Genève, a rappelé que le Conseil s’était saisi de la situation en Ukraine en 2014, « au moment où un régime est arrivé au pouvoir à Kiev à la suite d'un coup d'État anticonstitutionnel qui, dans les meilleures traditions de l'Allemagne nazie, a entrepris de virtuellement exterminer la population russophone de son pays »., « Les résultats tragiques sont bien connus », a ajouté le Représentant permanent de la Fédération de Russie, citant « les dizaines de personnes brûlées vives dans la Maison des syndicats à Odessa, des tirs de snipers contre des manifestants pacifiques sur le Maïdan lui-même et des massacres brutaux de dissidents à travers l'Ukraine ». La population du Donbass ne voulait pas vivre dans la peur perpétuelle, ni être éventuellement exterminée, a ajouté M. Gatilov. Il ne tenait qu’à Kiev de remplir ses propres engagements au titre du paquet de mesures de Minsk pour parvenir à la paix sur son propre territoire, a-t-il affirmé., Depuis huit ans, le Conseil discute régulièrement de la situation en Ukraine, a poursuivi M. Gatilov, avant de s’interroger sur les progrès réalisés durant tout ce temps. Le Haut-Commissariat aux droits de l’homme a préparé 45 rapports sur la base des matériaux émanant de sa propre Mission d'observation et chacun d'entre eux documente la souffrance de la population du Donbass. Il semblerait donc que « les membres du Conseil avaient entre leurs mains tous les éléments factuels sur la base desquels des conclusions pouvaient être tirées pour remédier à la situation », a déclaré M. Gatilov. « Il aurait été possible de sauver la vie des habitants du Don et de Lougansk tués par les forces armées et les nationalistes ukrainiens et d'empêcher l'escalade actuelle », a-t-il affirmé. Pour cela, les pays de l’Union européenne et les États-Unis auraient dû exercer une pression sur les autorités de Kiev pour les encourager à prendre des mesures afin d’améliorer la situation dans leur propre pays et de résoudre le conflit au Donbas, a dit M. Gatilov. Au lieu de cela, « vous avez ignoré la tragédie de la population de cette région et, en fait, de toute l’Ukraine », a-t-il déclaré., M. Gatilov a demandé aux États-Unis et à l’Union européenne : « Dans lequel des documents internationaux relatifs aux droits de l'homme auxquels vous êtes parties est-il écrit que la fourniture d'armes létales contribue à sauver des vies humaines ? ». « Durant la seule agression de l'OTAN contre la Yougoslavie en 1999 , durant laquelle vous avez utilisé des armes complètement inhumaines et eu recours à des frappes avec des bombes à fragmentation aveugles, quelque 200 000 civils ont été tués, y compris des enfants », leur a-t-il également lancé. Et qu’en est-il des « centaines de milliers de vies que votre travail missionnaire en Afghanistan, en Iraq, en Libye ou en Syrie ont prises », a-t-il ajouté ?, C’est très simple, a conclu le Représentant permanent de la Fédération de Russie : « il n'est pas dans votre intérêt que l'Ukraine reste calme et prospère. […] Vous n'avez pas besoin que la situation dans ce pays soit réglée. Et le régime fantoche de Zelensky ne vous intéresse que comme outil de pression et monnaie d'échange dans votre confrontation avec la Russie »., MME EMINE DZHAPAROVA, Première Vice-Ministre des affaires étrangères de l’Ukraine, a dénoncé une « menace existentielle pour les droits de l’homme provoquée par la violation des principes fondamentaux du droit international consacrés par la Charte des Nations Unies » de la part d’une puissance majeure, membre du Conseil de sécurité, un des plus grands pays au monde – d’un « dirigeant qui veut paraître fort alors qu’il est faible, le Président Poutine »., L’invasion de l’Ukraine par la Fédération de Russie amorce sa deuxième semaine, a poursuivi Mme Dhzaparova, « et chaque jour apporte son lot de morts, d’indignité, de déshonneur, de décès ». Une maternité a été bombardée, tandis que la Fédération de Russie frappe avec des missiles en pleine nuit, a dénoncé la Vice-Ministre., Pendant que [en Fédération de Russie] la police russe jette en prison des centaines de Russes qui osent dire non à la guerre, des millions d’Ukrainiens résistent, luttent contre les tanks à main nue, servent volontairement de boucliers humains pour protéger une centrale nucléaire, a rappelé Mme Dhzaparova. Les bombes russes détruisent villes et villages, églises, musées, parcs et infrastructures critiques. “Des millions de mes compatriotes ont été contraints de devenir des réfugiés ou des personnes déplacées à l'intérieur de leur propre pays. Tout ceci se produit en Ukraine, en 2022, sous vos yeux et à vos portes », a mis en garde Mme Dhzaparova., « Nous n’avons rien fait pour provoquer cela, nous essayons seulement (…) de construire notre futur comme nous l’imaginons sans notre voisin », a expliqué la Vice-Ministre ukrainienne, avant de dénoncer un « groupe de criminels de guerre avec accès au bouton nucléaire [qui] se place au-dessus du droit international ». Le Conseil joue un rôle prépondérant pour conjuguer les efforts afin de permettre que la Fédération de Russie réponde de ses actes et de ses crimes envers l’Ukraine, a souligné Mme Dhzaparova. Alors que le Conseil va se prononcer sur une résolution prévoyant la création d’une commission d’enquête sur les violations des droits de l’homme et du droit international humanitaire résultant de l’agression russe, dans le prolongement de la résolution de l’Assemblée générale intitulée « Agression contre l’Ukraine » adoptée hier, Mme Dhzaparova a remercié celles et ceux qui ont fait preuve d’une forte solidarité avec l’Ukraine. « C’est un moment de vérité non seulement pour l’Ukraine, qui tente de survivre, mais pour tout le système international des droits de l’homme et ses institutions », a conclu la Vice-Ministre., Aperçu du débat, Hier, à l’Assemblée générale, 141 membres des Nations Unies ont déjà dénoncé l’agression russe contre l’Ukraine, ont souligné nombre de délégations, avant de condamner la « violation flagrante des principes fondamentaux du droit international » que constitue « l’agression militaire non provoquée et injustifiée » contre l'Ukraine par la Fédération de Russie. Une action militaire menée par un membre du Conseil contre un autre État membre est incompatible avec les buts et principes régissant la coexistence pacifique entre les nations, a-t-il été souligné. Plusieurs intervenants ont ajouté que « l’invasion en cours », dont la responsabilité incombe au seul Président Poutine est le point culminant des actions hostiles de la Fédération de Russie visant l'Ukraine depuis 2014. Il ne s’agit pas seulement d’une attaque contre l’Ukraine, mais d’une attaque contre l’Europe, a-t-il été dit., Le peuple ukrainien se bat aujourd’hui non seulement pour la survie de son pays, mais aussi pour défendre l'ordre international fondé sur des règles et créé sur les cendres de la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Les conséquences dévastatrices de cette agression sont, non seulement pour l'Europe, mais aussi pour le monde entier, a-t-il été affirmé., Malgré des « efforts inlassables » de l’Union européenne pour parvenir à une solution diplomatique, a-t-il été affirmé, la Fédération de Russie a opté « unilatéralement » pour une « escalade grave et préméditée. » On assiste à des scènes effroyables d’attaques aveugles de l’armée russe contre des cibles civiles, a-t-il été souligné. Il ne saurait y avoir de place au sein de ce Conseil pour les auteurs de telles terribles violations, a affirmé un intervenant., Le Président Poutine a menti, afin de justifier une « agression inacceptable et sans issue », a-t-il été affirmé. Un pays qui a combattu le fascisme ne peut agir de la sorte, a déploré une délégation, jugeant aussi que les hostilités contre l'Ukraine vont à l'encontre des principes de respect de la souveraineté, de l'intégrité territoriale, de la non-ingérence dans les affaires intérieures d'un autre État souverain, ainsi que de l'interdiction du recours à la force ou de la menace d’y recourir. La Fédération de Russie manipule cyniquement la notion de génocide pour justifier son agression – une accusation que les rapports de l’Organisation pour la sécurité et la coopération en Europe (OSCE) et des Nations Unies ne confirment pas, a-t-il été souligné., Pour quelques délégations, la « vérité » est plutôt que l’ordre mondial datant de plus de 30 ans est en train de changer et cela témoigne en outre de l’échec de l’architecture sécuritaire internationale. Une délégation a affirmé que l’on cherche en réalité à déstabiliser la Fédération de Russie, en ayant recours à divers stratagèmes., Cette attaque russe fait courir un risque immense à des millions de personnes, alors même que de nombreux civils sont déjà morts ou ont été blessés et que des centaines de milliers de personnes sont déplacées, a-t-il été rappelé. Plusieurs délégations ont déploré des attaques répétées et ciblées contre des infrastructures civiles, y compris des écoles et des hôpitaux, de la part des forces armées russes, et ont dénoncé le recours à des armes explosives et à sous munitions dans des zones habitées pour semer la terreur au sein de la population civile – des pratiques proscrites par les Conventions de Genève., Un cessez-le-feu s’impose pour réduire les tensions et rechercher une solution pacifique, ont plaidé plusieurs délégations. Toutes les parties ont été appelées à protéger, en tant que priorité absolue, les femmes et les enfants en Ukraine, de même qu’à assurer le passage de l’aide humanitaire aux personnes dans le besoin. Plusieurs délégations se sont prononcés en faveur d’un corridor humanitaire permettant l’acheminement sans entrave de l’aide humanitaire ou ont plaidé pour des « pauses humanitaires », à des fins exclusivement humanitaires., Certains intervenants ont part de leurs inquiétudes s’agissant de ressortissants africains en Ukraine qui se verraient refuser le droit de traverser la frontière pour se mettre à l’abri hors du pays., La Fédération de Russie a été appelée à retirer ses troupes de l'ensemble du territoire de l'Ukraine et à respecter pleinement et sans condition l’intégrité territoriale et l’indépendance du pays. Elle a aussi été appelée à respecter le droit international humanitaire et les droits de l'homme. Plusieurs orateurs ont demandé à la Fédération de Russie de mettre fin à cette « guerre injuste », mais aussi à sa campagne de désinformation et de cyberattaques. Il n’y a que la Fédération de Russie qui puisse mettre un terme à cette « folie », a-t-il été affirmé., Nombre de délégations ont apporté leur soutien à toutes les initiatives qui sont prises pour résoudre le conflit par le biais de moyens diplomatiques, et ont plaidé pour un processus de désescalade. Elles ont salué les efforts diplomatiques qui sont actuellement en cours entre la Fédération de Russie et l’Ukraine pour trouver une solution au conflit., Il est crucial de veiller à ce que tous les auteurs des violations perpétrées dans le cadre de ce conflit soient traduits en justice, a-t-il été souligné. La nécessité de créer une commission d'enquête sur toutes les violations des droits de l'homme commises par la Fédération de Russie en Ukraine – comme le prévoit le projet de résolution sur lequel le Conseil doit se prononcer demain – a été jugée indispensable., Le Conseil ne peut s’exonérer de ses responsabilités, a-t-il été affirmé, alors qu’il doit se prononcer sur un projet de texte, il est essentiel qu’il s'informe de la situation des droits de l'homme en Ukraine, surveille son évolution et prenne des mesures pour prévenir et documenter les violations des droits de l'homme, a-t-on souligné. La communauté internationale dans son ensemble doit assumer ses responsabilités pour faire la lumière sur toutes les violations du droit international humanitaire commises en Ukraine et rendre les auteurs des violences responsables de leurs actes. Une délégation a exhorté le Conseil des droits de l'homme à utiliser tous les mécanismes et instruments à sa disposition pour éviter une escalade des violences., Plusieurs délégations ont insisté sur l’importance des saisines de la Cour pénale internationale et de la Cour internationale de justice., Quelques délégations ont pour leur part clairement annoncé leur opposition à toute résolution du Conseil des droits de l’homme sur le sujet, estimant que la création d’une commission d’enquête ne contribuerait pas à trouver une solution diplomatique à la crise. Le Conseil se doit d’éviter la politisation des droits de l’homme, a-t-il été souligné. D’aucuns ont mis en garde contre « la politique de deux poids deux mesures au sein du Conseil à laquelle se livrent certains États qui sont eux-mêmes responsables des pires violations des droits de l'homme dans le monde ». Le Conseil devrait au contraire chercher le dialogue et promouvoir la paix, y compris par la prise en compte de tous les points de vue., L’escalade actuelle prend sa source dans l’effondrement des accords de Minsk, à l’instigation des États-Unis, dans l’expansion incessante de l’OTAN vers l’est et dans une attitude hostile envers la Fédération de Russie, a dit un intervenant. D’aucuns ont dénoncé les années de silence de la communauté internationale concernant les violations des droits de l’homme dans le Donbass et le bombardement de quartiers résidentiels dans cette même région. L’une d’entre elles a estimé que ce conflit prenait sa source dans la politique hégémoniste des États-Unis. Une délégation a estimé que les chantages, les sanctions et les menaces ne génèrent que davantage de conflit., La population russe n’est pas ici l’ennemie, a-t-il été rappelé, alors que plusieurs intervenants exprimaient leur soutien aux défenseurs des droits de l’homme russes et bélarussiens., *Liste des intervenants : Pologne, Lituanie, Finlande, France (au nom de l’Union européenne), Arabie saoudite (au nom du Conseil de coopération du Golfe), Barbade (au nom d’un groupe de pays), Maroc (au nom du Groupe arabe), Côte d’Ivoire (au nom du Groupe africain), Allemagne, Îles Marshall, France, Japon, Venezuela, Luxembourg, Émirats arabes unis, Inde, Paraguay, Mexique, Honduras, République de Corée, États-Unis, Libye, Chine, Pays Bas, Indonésie, Royaume-Uni, Monténégro, Népal, Argentine, Malaisie, Bolivie, Brésil, Malawi, Pakistan, Bénin, Érythrée, Colombie, Belgique, Estonie, Islande, Slovénie, Norvège, Croatie, Portugal, Suède, Espagne, Autriche, République tchèque, Costa Rica, Bulgarie, Italie, Slovaquie, Roumanie, Ordre souverain de Malte, Monaco, Brunei Darussalam, Vanuatu, République dominicaine, Canada, Australie, Turquie, Organisation internationale de droit du développement, Maldives, Singapour, Andorre, Trinité-et-Tobago, Grèce, Bélarus, Albanie, République arabe syrienne, Lettonie, Chypre, Géorgie, Irlande, Thaïlande, Malte, Suisse, Uruguay, Danemark, Nicaragua, République de Moldova, Nouvelle-Zélande, Chili, Liechtenstein, Équateur, Guatemala, Israël, Programme des Nations Unies pour le développement (PNUD), République populaire démocratique de Corée, Afghanistan, Saint-Siège, Liban, Timor-Leste, Macédoine du Nord, Afrique du Sud, Saint-Marin, Pérou, Jamaïque, Bangladesh, Bosnie-Herzégovine, Cabo Verde, Fonds des Nations Unies pour l’enfance (UNICEF)., Ce document produit par le Service de l’information des Nations Unies à Genève est destiné à l'information; il ne constitue pas un document officiel., Les versions anglaise et française de nos communiqués sont différentes car elles sont le produit de deux équipes de couverture distinctes qui travaillent indépendamment., HRC22.011F",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-752-victimes-civiles-confirm-es-au-1er-mars-dont-227-tu-s-et-plus-de-deux

"Invasion of Ukraine – International Law, IHL, binding Norms and Accountability measures for the Cyberspace are needed more than ever",News and Press Release,ICT for Peace Foundation,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,4 Mar 2022,"The military invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing cyberwar made it abundantly clear, that the application of the International Law and the International Humanitarian Law in the Cyberspace and the making of International Norms for Responsible State Behaviour legally binding, are of utmost importance., Equally, new accountability mechanisms at the UN and elsewhere for holding perpetrators of international law and norms in the cyberspace accountable are urgently needed., That is why ICT4Peace has called for an International code of conduct since 2011 and subsequently supported the efforts to develop International Norms of Responsible State Behaviour, inter alia with the preparation of this first Commentary published by UN ODA in 2017., In 2019 ICT4Peace launched at the UN OEWG a public Call to Governments on Critical Infrastructure and Offensive Cyber Operations:, ICT4Peace calls upon governments, especially those possessing offensive cyber capabilities, to publicly confirm that they will respect the norm prohibiting cyber operations directed at critical infrastructure. This will provide a proactive means of assuring the international community that these states are committed to acting in a responsible manner in cyberspace., Of equal importance is to introduce robust State-lead Accountability Measures for the Cyberspace, and that is why ICT4Peace proposed to the UN OEWG in 2019 the “States Cyber Peer Review Mechanism” for state-conducted foreign cyber operations, Finally, ICT4Peace has been supporting the implementation of the UN GGE Norms and the findings of the UN OEWG through Global Cybersecurity Policy and Diplomacy Capacity Building programs of the ICT4Peace Academy., Please find attached the compilation of ICT4Peace inputs to and comments on the UN OEWG 2019 – 2021., And the Submission by ICT4Peace to the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies 2021-20251.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/invasion-ukraine-international-law-ihl-binding-norms-and-accountability-measures

The next report will be produced on 4 March., HIGHLIGHTS, • The most affected areas of the country are facing a major humanitarian crisis. Increasing numbers of people are trapped in cities under constant attack, as wide-scale evacuations have not been possible in certain locations., • Over the reporting period, major urban centres, such as Kharkiv (east), Kherson (south), Mariupol (south-east) and the capital Kyiv, witnessed the most intense clashes since the Russian military offensive began on 24 February. Settlements along the “contact line” in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, such as Volnovakha, Shchastia and Stanytsia Luhanska, have been all but completely devastated., • Between 4 a.m. on 24 February and 2 March 2022, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 802 civilian casualties in Ukraine, including 249 people killed. The human cost of ongoing clashes is likely much higher as access and security challenges make it difficult to verify the actual number of deaths and injuries., • As clashes escalate, a growing number of people are being displaced every day within Ukraine and across international borders. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), a staggering 1 million have fled Ukraine during the last week., • While access challenges and a rapidly deteriorating security environment hinder response efforts, humanitarian organizations are working on adapting and adjusting their delivery approaches in order to continue providing assistance despite the operational limitations they face., 18M affected people (Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), 6M targeted for assistance (Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), $1.1B financial requirements (Source: 2022 Flash Appeal), 1M refugees in other countries (Source: UNHCR), 802 civilian casualties (Source: OHCHR), SITUATION OVERVIEW, On 2 March, major urban centres in certain parts of Ukraine, such as Kharkiv (east), Kherson (south), Mariupol (south-east), and the capital Kyiv, witnessed the most intense clashes since the Russian military offensive began on 24 February. Settlements along the “contact line” in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, such as Volnovakha, Shchastia and Stanytsia Luhanska, have been heavily impacted. Between 4 a.m. on 24 February and 2 March 2022, OHCHR recorded 802 civilian casualties in Ukraine, including 249 people killed. The human cost of ongoing clashes is likely much higher as access and security challenges make it difficult to verify the actual number of deaths and injuries., In recent days, many cities have experienced relentless shelling that has caused significant damage to crucial infrastructure and further restricted access to vital services. Critical supplies, including food, medicine and basic hygiene items, are becoming increasingly scarcer in the hardest-hit areas, while dwindling cash reserves, empty ATMs and suspended money transfer services have greatly curtailed affected people’s ability to purchase basic goods even when markets are functioning and accessible., Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) needs, especially in eastern Ukraine, continue to worsen as escalating tensions prevent urgently needed repair works from being carried out, while limited access makes it more difficult for partners to provide WASH assistance. In Mariupol, Sartana and Staryi Krym, around 470,000 people remain without access to water., Stoppages in the water supply are also reportedly affecting the functioning of heating systems in certain locations amid freezing winter temperatures., Moreover, the health needs generated by the ongoing conflict are particularly acute. The World Health Organization (WHO) says it has received several unconfirmed reports of attacks on hospitals and health infrastructure. There are critical shortages of oxygen and other critical drugs and medical supplies, as conflict-related injuries and COVID-19 infections place increasing strain on the already-weak healthcare system. With millions of people now on the move, the conditions on the ground are ripe for the spread of COVID-19, potentially triggering a double health emergency that could overwhelm the health system., In Kyiv, thousands of people continue to pack overcrowded train stations in an attempt to flee the capital as Russian troops advance towards the city, limiting the movement of people and essential goods in and out of the city. On 2 March, debris from a powerful explosion reportedly landed close to the central railway station in Kyiv used to evacuate thousands of women and children. The level of damage and number of civilian causalities have yet to be confirmed., The most affected areas of the country are facing a full-blown humanitarian crisis. Increasing numbers of people are trapped in cities under constant attack, as wide-scale evacuations have not been possible in certain locations., As clashes escalate, a growing number of people are being displaced every day within Ukraine and across international borders, increasing the scope and scale of the ongoing crisis into neighbouring countries. According to UNHCR, one million people have fled Ukraine over the last week – the equivalent of more than 142,000 people on average per day – a number that will likely increase as constant violence and destruction of homes displaces more people., The situation of third country nationals from countries in Africa and South Asia and other ethnic minority groups in Ukraine, including the Roma population, is particularly concerning, as there have been numerous reports of discrimination and even violence against these vulnerable groups. The Roma population lack civil status documents, limiting access to critical services, including education and health, and potentially humanitarian assistance as many Roman internally displaced people were not registered prior to the current escalation in conflict.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-300-pm-eet-3-march-2022

Health facilities are focused on treating trauma patients; already strained by the COVID-19 pandemic, they suffer from lack of maintenance and aging medical equipment, shortages of medicines and medical supplies, understaffing, and disruptions to management due to recent health reforms and decentralization., While facilities focus on urgent trauma patients, other health threats are looming. Shortages of medical supplies combined with challenging access to health care facilities will exacerbate the burden of chronic disease; limited oxygen supplies compromise the clinical management of patients with severe COVID-19, and displacement, poor shelter, and overcrowded living conditions caused by the conflict are likely to increase the risk of infectious disease. To help cope with this crisis, the conflict-affected population is also in urgent need of mental health and psychosocial support services (MHPSS).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-public-health-situation-analysis-phsa-short-form-last-update-3-march-2022

Update 8 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (3 March 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,3 Mar 2022,"Ukraine has informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that staff who have been kept at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) since Russian military forces took control of the site a week ago were facing “psychological pressure and moral exhaustion”, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said, stressing that they must be allowed to rest and rotate so that their crucial work can be carried out safely and securely., This was part of a joint appeal to the IAEA Director General, received today, from the Ukraine Government, regulatory authority and the national operator which added that personnel at the Chornobyl site “have limited opportunities to communicate, move and carry out full-fledged maintenance and repair work”., They also confirmed to the Director General that Ukraine has lost regulatory control over all the facilities in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, and asked the IAEA to undertake measures “in order to reestablish legal regulation of safety of nuclear facilities and installations within the Chernobyl NPP site and within the Exclusion Zone”. The Director General said earlier this week that he was conducting consultations in order to address a request from the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) for immediate assistance to ensure the safety of the Chornobyl NPP and other nuclear facilities in Ukraine., In a separate technical update to the IAEA today, the SNRIU reported that power from one of the two off-site power transmission lines supplying electricity to the site was lost overnight. This power line does not provide power to safety-related equipment. Neverthless, due to this loss of power, there were difficulties in carrying out routine maintenance and repair of some safety-critical equipment, SNRIU said., Due to time elapsed since the 1986 Chornobyl accident, the heat load of the spent fuel storage pool and the volume of cooling water contained in the pool is sufficient to maintain effective heat removal without the need for electrical supply., Furthermore, the site has back-up emergency diesel generators available should there be a total loss of power., The event highlights once again why Director General Grossi has repeatedly stressed that any military or other action that could threaten the safety or security of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants must be avoided., “I remain gravely concerned about the deteriorating situation in Ukraine, especially about the country’s nuclear power plants, which must be able to continue operating without any safety or security threats,” he said. “Any accident caused as a result of the military conflict could have extremely serious consequences for people and the environment, in Ukraine and beyond.”, The Chornobyl NPP has been undergoing decommissioning since the accident and significant amounts of nuclear material remain in various facilities at the site in the form of spent fuel and other radioactive waste., At a meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors on Wednesday, Director General Grossi stressed the “utmost importance that the staff working at the Specialized Enterprise Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant are able to do their job safely and effectively, and that their personal wellbeing is guaranteed by those who have taken control”. Operating staff at all of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities must be able to fulfil their safety and security duties and have the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure, he added in his Board statement., Ukraine also has 15 operational nuclear reactors at four sites in the country, providing roughly half of its electricity, which SNRIU reported today continue to operate normally., The IAEA continues to closely monitor developments in Ukraine, with a special focus on the safety and security of its nuclear power reactors. The IAEA remains in constant contact with its counterpart and will continue to provide regular updates on the situation in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-8-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-3-march-2022-enru
Update 7 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (2 March 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,2 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that the same staff had been working at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) since Russian forces last week took control of the site of the 1986 nuclear accident, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said, expressing his growing concern about their continued wellbeing and ability to do their jobs safely and effectively., In a regular update to the IAEA, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) said it maintained communications with the Chornobyl site – whose personnel it said were carrying out their duties under “supervision” – and that no operation involving nuclear material had been conducted there since 24 February., The Chornobyl NPP, located in an Exclusion Zone, has been undergoing decommissioning since the accident and significant amounts of nuclear material remain in various facilities at the site in the form of spent fuel and other radioactive waste., “It is of utmost importance that the staff working at the Specialized Enterprise Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant are able to do their job safely and effectively, and that their personal wellbeing is guaranteed by those who have taken control,” Director General Grossi told the IAEA Board of Governors during a meeting in Vienna today on the situation in Ukraine., Operating staff at all of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities – which also include 15 operational reactors at four sites – must be able to fulfil their safety and security duties and have the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure, he added., The Director General has repeatedly stressed that any military or other action that could threaten the safety or security of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants must be avoided., In today’s update, SNRIU said it maintained communications with the country’s nuclear power plants, which it said continued to operate as before. Radiation levels remained normal at all sites and there had been no reports of nuclear or radiological incidents, it said. Of Ukraine’s 15 reactors, more than half were operating at full capacity while others were undergoing scheduled maintenance or held “in reserve”, it added., IAEA Member States feed information from automated radiation monitoring stations directly into the IAEA International Radiation Monitoring Information System (IRMIS). The IAEA on 1 March lost contact with such stations at the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest of Ukraine’s nuclear sites with six out of its 15 reactors, and today stopped receiving the same kind of data from another plant, the South Ukrainian NPP, with three units., However, SNRIU later informed the IAEA that contact with the monitoring stations at the South Ukrainian NPP had been restored, saying the temporary loss of transmission to the IAEA was due to technical reasons and not related to military operations. Ukrainian specialists were seeking to determine the cause of the lost data transfer from the Zaporizhzhia NPP and to restore it, SNRIU added., The IAEA continues to closely monitor developments in Ukraine, with a special focus on the safety and security of its nuclear power reactors. The IAEA remains in constant contact with its counterpart and will continue to provide regular updates on the situation in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-7-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-2-march-2022-enru

Lettre datée du 28 février 2014, adressée à la Présidente du Conseil de sécurité par le Représentant permanent de l’Ukraine auprès de l’Organisation des Nations Unies (S/2014/136), L’Assemblée générale,, Réaffirmant l’importance primordiale de la Charte des Nations Unies pour la promotion du respect de la légalité parmi les nations,, Rappelant que, en vertu de l’Article 2 de la Charte, tous les États sont tenus de s’abstenir, dans leurs relations internationales, de recourir à la menace ou à l’emploi de la force, soit contre l’intégrité territoriale ou l’indépendance politique de tout État, soit de toute autre manière incompatible avec les buts des Nations Unies, et de régler leurs différends internationaux par des moyens pacifiques,, Rappelant également que, en vertu du paragraphe 2 de l’Article 2 de la Charte, les Membres de l’Organisation, afin d’assurer à tous la jouissance des droits et avantages résultant de leur qualité de Membre, doivent remplir de bonne foi les obligations qu’ils ont assumées aux termes de la Charte,, Prenant note de la résolution 2623 (2022) du Conseil de sécurité en date du 27 février 2022, par laquelle celui-ci a convoqué une session extraordinaire d’urgence de l’Assemblée générale pour examiner la question figurant dans le document publié sous la cote S/Agenda/8979,, Rappelant sa résolution 377 A (V) du 3 novembre 1950, intitulée « L’union pour le maintien de la paix », et considérant que l’absence d’unanimité parmi les membres permanents du Conseil de sécurité lors de sa 8979e séance a empêché celui-ci d’exercer sa responsabilité principale en matière de maintien de la paix et de la sécurité internationales,, Rappelant également sa résolution 2625 (XXV) du 24 octobre 1970, par laquelle elle a approuvé la Déclaration relative aux principes du droit international touchant les relations amicales et la coopération entre les États conformément à la Charte des Nations Unies, et réaffirmant les principes qui y sont énoncés, à savoir que le territoire d’un État ne saurait faire l’objet d’une acquisition par un autre État à la suite du recours à la menace ou à l’emploi de la force, et que toute action visant à rompre partiellement ou totalement l’unité nationale, l’intégrité territoriale ou l’indépendance politique d’un État ou d’un pays est incompatible avec les buts et les principes de la Charte,, Rappelant en outre sa résolution 3314 (XXIX) du 14 décembre 1974, dans laquelle elle a défini l’agression comme l’emploi de la force armée par un État contre la souveraineté, l’intégrité territoriale ou l’indépendance politique d’un autre État, ou de toute autre manière incompatible avec la Charte,, Ayant à l’esprit qu’il importe de maintenir et de consolider la paix internationale, qui repose sur la liberté, l’égalité, la justice et le respect des droits humains, et de développer des relations amicales entre les nations, quel que soit le ur système politique, économique ou social ou leur niveau de développement,, Rappelant l’Acte final de la Conférence sur la sécurité et la coopération en Europe, signé à Helsinki le 1 er août 1975, et le Mémorandum concernant les garanties de sécurité liées à l’adhésion de l’Ukraine au Traité sur la non-prolifération des armes nucléaires (Mémorandum de Budapest) du 5 décembre 1994,, Condamnant la déclaration du 24 février 2022 dans laquelle la Fédération de Russie a annoncé le lancement d’une « opération militaire spéciale » en Ukraine,, Réaffirmant que nulle acquisition territoriale obtenue par la menace ou l’emploi de la force ne sera reconnue comme légale,, Se déclarant gravement préoccupée par les informations faisant état d’attaques contre des établissements civils tels que des logements, des écoles et des hôpitaux, ainsi que de victimes civiles, dont des femmes, des personnes âgées, des personnes en situation de handicap et des enfants,, Constatant que les opérations militaires russes menées à l’intérieur du territoire souverain de l’Ukraine auxquelles la communauté internationale assiste sont d’une ampleur jamais vue en Europe depuis des décennies et considérant que des mesures doivent être prises d’urgence pour sauver cette génération du fléau de la guerre,, Faisant sienne la déclaration du Secrétaire général en date 24 février 2022, dans laquelle celui-ci a rappelé que l’emploi de la force par un pays contre un autre était une répudiation des principes que tout pays s’était engagé à respecter et que l’offensive militaire actuelle de la Fédération de Russie était contraire à la Charte des Nations Unies,, Condamnant la décision de la Fédération de Russie d’augmenter le niveau de préparation de ses forces nucléaires,, Se déclarant gravement préoccupée par la détérioration de la situation humanitaire en Ukraine et aux alentours, qui se traduit par un accroissement du nombre de déplacés et de réfugiés ayant besoin d’une aide humanitaire,, Se déclarant préoccupée également par le fait que le conflit pourrait exacerber l’insécurité alimentaire à l’échelle planétaire, l’Ukraine et la région étant parmi les plus gros exportateurs mondiaux de céréales et de produits agricoles, alors que des millions de personnes sont en proie à la famine ou exposées à un risque immédiat de famine ou à une grave insécurité alimentaire dans plusieurs régions du monde, et avoir des répercussions sur la sécurité énergétique,, Se félicitant des efforts incessants que déploient le Secrétaire général, l’Organisation pour la sécurité et la coopération en Europe et d’autres organisations internationales et régionales pour désamorcer la situation concernant l’Ukraine, et encourageant la poursuite du dialogue,, Réaffirme son engagement envers la souveraineté, l’indépendance, l’unité et l’intégrité territoriale de l’Ukraine à l’intérieur de ses frontières internationalement reconnues, s’étendant à ses eaux territoriales ;, Déplore dans les termes les plus énergiques l’agression commise par la Fédération de Russie contre l’Ukraine en violation du paragraphe 4 de l’Article 2 de la Charte ;, Exige que la Fédération de Russie cesse immédiatement d’employer la force contre l’Ukraine et s’abstienne de tout nouveau recours illicite à la menace ou à l’emploi de la force contre tout État Membre ;, Exige également que la Fédération de Russie retire immédiatement, complètement et sans condition toutes ses forces militaires du territoire ukrainien à l’intérieur des frontières internationalement reconnues du pays ;, Déplore la décision prise le 21 février 2022 par la Fédération de Russie concernant le statut de certaines zones des régions ukrainiennes de Donetsk et de Louhansk, qui constitue une violation de l’intégrité territoriale et de la souveraineté de l’Ukraine et contrevient aux principes de la Charte ;, Exige que la Fédération de Russie revienne immédiatement et sans condition sur sa décision relative au statut de certaines zones des régions ukrainiennes de Donetsk et de Louhansk ;, Demande à la Fédération de Russie de se conformer aux principes énoncés dans la Charte et dans la Déclaration relative aux principes du droit

la force contre l’Ukraine et lui demande de respecter ses obligations internationales ;, Condamne toutes les violations du droit international humanitaire, les violations des droits humains et les atteintes à ces droits, et engage toutes les parties à respecter strictement les dispositions applicables du droit international humanitaire, notamment les Conventions de Genève de 19492 et le

veiller à épargner la population civile et les biens de caractère civil, s’abstenir d’attaquer, de détruire, d’enlever ou de mettre hors d’usage des biens indispensables à la survie de la population civile, et respecter et protéger le personnel humanitaire et les articles destinés aux opérations de secours humanitaire ;, Prie le Coordonnateur des secours d’urgence de fournir, 30 jours après l’adoption de la présente résolution, un rapport sur la situation humanitaire en Ukraine et sur l’action humanitaire ;, Demande instamment que le conflit entre la Fédération de Russie et l’Ukraine

Human Rights Council Begins Urgent Debate on Situation of Human Rights in Ukraine Stemming from the Russian Aggression,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,3 Mar 2022,"The Human Rights Council today began an urgent debate on the situation of human rights in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression., Michelle Bachelet, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said one week ago, the Russian Federation's military attack on Ukraine had opened a new and dangerous chapter in world history. The attack that began on 24 February was generating a massive impact on the human rights of millions of people across Ukraine. Elevated threat levels for nuclear weapons underlined the gravity of the risks to all of humanity. Over two million people had been forced to flee their homes. Tens of millions of people remained in Ukraine, in potentially mortal danger. There should be an immediate resolution of the conflict through peaceful means., Victor Madrigal-Borloz, Chair of the Special Procedures' Coordinating Committee, said the military invasion carried out by the Russian Federation had caused the people in Ukraine immense suffering and irreparable harm. The Russian Federation should observe and respect international law; end hostilities immediately and unconditionally; stop immediately all human rights violations stemming from the attack; facilitate the immediate and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance; and restore the ability of the people in Ukraine to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms without military or external interference., Gennady Gatilov, Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations Office at Geneva, speaking as a country concerned, said the situation in Ukraine had been before the Council since 2014. At that time, a regime had come to power in Kyiv after an anti-constitutional coup that began to virtually exterminate the Russian-speaking population of the country. The Human Rights Council had had the opportunity to act on these reports and protect democracy and the people of Ukraine, and preserve a multi-ethnic and multicultural Ukrainian society, but it had failed to do so., Emine Dzhaparova, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, speaking as a country concerned, said the Council had gathered today to discuss the existential threat to human rights as a principle, not only caused by the breach of the fundamental principles of international law, but also by the breach of international law by one of the biggest countries of the world, by one of the members of the Security Council, by a weak leader who wished to look strong, who pushed his country into the hell of crime and injustice against Ukraine., In the ensuing debate, many speakers condemned the Russian military aggression in the strongest possible terms: hundreds of civilians killed, injured, displaced, this was the dire reality of the situation. There should be an independent commission of inquiry to look into all human rights violations committed in Ukraine. The safety of those fleeing the attacks should be guaranteed, as should be humanitarian access. The Council must hold Russia accountable, and the international community must send a strong message to Russia that it must live up to its international commitments and provide support and assistance to Ukraine. Some speakers raised the cause of the conflict, saying that it was in part due to the hegemonistic policies of the short-lived governments of the West, including the United States and the European Union. It was not up to the Human Rights Council to discuss the situation, given the hypocrisy displayed by that body, and given the human rights violations committed by the Ukrainian Government over previous years., Speaking in the debate were the representatives of Poland, Barbados, Finland, France on behalf of the European Union, Saudi Arabia on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Barbados on behalf of a Group of Caribbean States in Geneva, Morocco on behalf of the Group of Arab States, Côte d’Ivoire on behalf of the Group of African States, Germany, Marshall Islands, France, Japan, Venezuela, Luxemburg, United Arab Emirates, India, Paraguay, Mexico, Honduras, Republic of Korea, United States, China, Netherlands, Indonesia, United Kingdom, Montenegro, Nepal, Argentina, Malaysia, Bolivia, Brazil, Malawi, Pakistan, Benin, Eritrea, Colombia, Belgium, Estonia, Iceland, Slovenia, Norway, Croatia, Portugal, Sweden, Spain, Austria, Czech Republic, Costa Rica, Bulgaria, Italy, Slovakia, Romania, Sovereign Order of Malta, Monaco, Brunei Darussalam, Vanuatu, Dominican Republic, Canada, Australia, Turkey, International Development Law Organization, Maldives, Singapore, Andorra, Trinidad and Tobago, Greece, Belarus, Albania, Syria, Latvia, Cyprus, Georgia, Ireland, Thailand, Malta, Switzerland, Uruguay, Denmark, Nicaragua, Republic of Moldova, New Zealand, Chile, Liechtenstein, Ecuador, Guatemala, Israel, United Nations Development Programme, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Afghanistan, Holy See, Lebanon, Timor-Leste, North Macedonia, South Africa, San Marino, Peru, Jamaica, Bangladesh, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cabo Verde, and the United Nations Children’s Fund., The webcast of the Human Rights Council meetings can be found here. All meeting summaries can be found here. Documents and reports related to the Human Rights Council’s forty-ninth regular session can be found here., The Council will resume its urgent debate on Ukraine at 10 a.m. on Friday, 4 March, to conclude the debate and to take action on a draft resolution., Opening Statements, MICHELLE BACHELET, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said one week ago, the Russian Federation's military attack on Ukraine had opened a new and dangerous chapter in world history. The Secretary-General had termed this as the most serious global peace and security crisis in recent years. The attack that began on 24 February was generating a massive impact on the human rights of millions of people across Ukraine. Elevated threat levels for nuclear weapons underlined the gravity of the risks to all of humanity. Military operations were escalating further as they spoke, with military strikes on and near large cities. By Tuesday night, her Office had recorded and confirmed 752 civilian casualties, including 227 killed – 15 of them children. At least 525 had been injured, including 28 children. The High Commissioner emphasised that the real figures would be far higher, since numerous other casualties were pending confirmation, and information from some areas engaged in intense hostilities had been delayed. Over two million people had been forced to flee their homes. Tens of millions of people remained in the country, in potentially mortal danger., The High Commissioner echoed the powerful call by the General Assembly yesterday for an immediate resolution of the conflict through peaceful means. States must abide by international law and the core principles that protected human life and human dignity. It was imperative that full access for the delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians across the entire country be enabled. Ms. Bachelet further noted that, at the international level, the International Court of Justice had been formally seized of proceedings connected to the conflict, and would begin hearings Monday on a request for provisional measures. In addition, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court had announced his decision to immediately proceed with active investigations on the situation in Ukraine. The Office of the High Commissioner’s human rights monitors would continue to operate across the country to the full extent of their capacity. This crisis demonstrated the vital importance of the Office’s objective monitoring and reporting in Ukraine – and in many other countries. As the Secretary-General had said, the United Nations Charter had always stood firm on the side of peace, security, development, justice, international law and human rights – and time after time, when the international community had rallied together in solidarity, those values had prevailed. It was vital that they prevailed today, in Ukraine – and elsewhere., VICTOR MADRIGAL-BORLOZ, Chair of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures, said as the world continued to watch with despair the disastrous impact of the military attack of the Russian Federation on Ukraine, it was now up to the Council to put human rights squarely in the response to the crisis and contribute to an immediate ceasefire, a de-escalation of tensions, and a firm return to diplomacy and dialogue. This military attack, which flagrantly violated international law and struck at the very heart of the spirit and object of the Charter, was fundamentally an attack on the order that enabled the work to further human rights and their objective to promote the respect of human dignity. The military invasion carried out by the Russian Federation had caused the people in Ukraine immense suffering and irreparable harm. The consequences of this unprovoked military attack for the protection and promotion of human rights in Ukraine would be profound and long-lasting and the catastrophic and traumatic effects of forced displacement and the destruction of vital infrastructure would last for generations. The Council should place and maintain human rights at the centre of this response through a series of concrete measures, by committing all efforts necessary to ensure due accountability from an evidence-based approach., The Council was also called on to deal with an array of human rights challenges around the world. The current focus on the urgent situation should not detract from attention to freedoms of assembly, association, and expression in the Russian Federation. The Council had already been warned on restrictions to fundamental freedoms within the Russian Federation, which were particularly alarming. Peaceful anti-war demonstrators continued to be arbitrarily arrested. The Coordination Committee called for all those arrested and detained to be treated consistently with the Russian Federation’s international human rights obligations and be released without further delay. In addition, the threat posed to the environment by the armed conflict, with areas reportedly contaminated by radiation, was also a source of deep concern. The Russian Federation should, among other things, observe and respect international law; end hostilities immediately and unconditionally; stop immediately all human rights violations stemming from the attack; facilitate the immediate and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance; and restore the ability of the people in Ukraine to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms without military or external interference., Statements by Countries Concerned, GENNADY GATILOV, Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations Office at Geneva, speaking as a country concerned, said that the situation in Ukraine had been before the Council since 2014. At that time, a regime had come to power in Kyiv after an anti-constitutional coup that began to virtually exterminate the Russian-speaking population of its country. As a result, dozens of people were burned alive at the Trade Union House in Odessa, snipers' shot peaceful protesters on the Maidan, and dissenters throughout Ukraine were brutally massacred. To achieve peace on its own territory Kyiv only had to fulfil the commitments it had undertaken under the Minsk Package of Measures. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights had prepared 45 reports documenting thousands of innocent civilians, including hundreds of children, killed as a result of bombing attacks by the Ukrainian armed forces. The reports also raised issues of arbitrary arrests, murder of journalists and opposition figures, hate speech, discrimination, and infringement of the rights of national minorities, including Hungarians, Russians and Roma. The Human Rights Council had had the opportunity to act on these reports and protect democracy and the people of Ukraine, and preserve a multi-ethnic and multicultural Ukrainian society. However, it had failed to do so. Why had the Council failed to address the human rights abuses of the criminal regime in Kyiv?, How was the United States and the European Union’s supply of lethal weapons to Ukraine contributing to protecting human rights and saving lives? In 1999, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s military had used inhumane weapons and carried out indiscriminate cluster bomb strikes against Yugoslavian citizens, killing some 2,000 civilians, including children. The “missionary work” of the United States and European Union had taken hundreds of thousands of lives in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria. Regarding Ukraine, it was not in the United States and European Union’s interests to keep Ukraine calm and prosperous, and those States were not interested in the lives of ordinary Ukrainians. Ukraine’s puppet regime was being used by these States as a pressure tool and a bargaining chip in their confrontation with Russia. Because of this, there was no added value in the Human Right Council debate for Russia., EMINE DZHAPAROVA, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, said that the Council had gathered today to discuss the existential threat to human rights as a principle, not only caused by the breach of the fundamental principles of international law, but also the breach by one of the biggest countries of the world, one of the members of the Security Council, by a weak leader who wished to look strong, who pushed his country into the hell of crime and injustice against Ukraine. Russia’s full-scale invasion had now entered its second week, with death, loss of dignity, and dishonour. The regime had put thousands of clean-living Russians behind bars when they dared to demonstrate against the war. These terrible events were happening in front of the eyes of the Council members. Millions were forced to become refugees and internally displaced persons within Ukraine. Russian bombs were destroying the cities and villages, targeting civilian infrastructures, schools, hospitals, orphanages, and others. Ukraine had done nothing to provoke this, seeking only to choose its own future., A group of war criminals, with access to the nuclear war button, had concluded that Ukraine was too weak to fight, and the international community would not react. But Ukraine was resisting, and the international coalition was strengthening every day. Recent events clearly pointed to the fact that Russian troops had carried out the most blatant abuses and violations of human rights, committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. The help of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the International Court of Justice, and the European Court of Human Rights was important, and the Human Rights Council had a role to play in uniting efforts for ensuring accountability of Russia for its crimes against Ukraine. At the end of the debate, the Council would consider a resolution establishing a commission of inquiry into violations of human rights and international humanitarian law stemming from Russia’s war. This initiative would become a next step with concrete practical implication in continuation of the United Nations General Assembly resolution called aggression against Ukraine, adopted yesterday with the overwhelming majority of United Nations Member States. All of those who had helped across the world and had expressed words of encouragement to Ukraine were thanked for their solidarity. This was a moment of truth, not just for Ukraine, but for the whole human rights system and its fundamental institutions, and those who were entrusted to protect human rights in the Council. The world should stand together to ensure accountability for the war criminals spilling the blood of Ukrainian children. Barbarians should have no seat in the room of alliance of civilisations., Debate, Speakers said that Russia’s actions were a basic violation of the principles of international law and a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter. The Russian military aggression was condemned in the strongest possible terms: hundreds of civilians killed, injured, displaced, this was the dire reality of the situation. There should be an independent commission of inquiry to look into all human rights violations committed in Ukraine, with the mandate to gather and analyse evidence to ensure that perpetrators were held accountable. The safety of those fleeing the attacks should be guaranteed, as should be humanitarian access. This was not a choice; it was an international legal obligation. The aggressor, Russia, and its facilitator, should be brought to justice. The democratic future of Ukraine must be defended. The Council must hold Russia accountable, and the international community must send a strong message to Russia that it must live up to its international commitments and provide support and assistance to Ukraine. Ukraine was a free, democratic and peaceful country, and Russia had unilaterally decided to escalate matters in a premeditated way. Russia was trying to re-write history, cynically using the pretext of genocide to justify its aggression, which was a dangerous precedent. None of the fraudulent assertions from Russia had been confirmed by a reputable and independent body. Russia should withdraw and recognise the sovereignty of Ukraine within its international borders., The democratically elected Government of Ukraine was fully within its rights to defend its territory. All parties should take steps to end the conflict as soon as possible in a way that took all the interests of the parties into account, and should comply strictly with the rules of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, and protect civilians. The principles of universal respect to the norms and standards of international humanitarian law were fundamental to establishing and maintaining peace and security, and all parties should respect them. There was concern for the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Ukraine, and all parties should work to ensure the safety and security of foreign nationals in the country, and to ensure that they could leave the country safety. The two parties to the conflict should proceed immediately to a ceasefire, finding a negotiated solution, which would minimise the number of fatalities. The General Assembly had sent a strong political statement already, and the brave Ukrainian people stood against the aggression. The Human Rights Council should not be used as a platform for distortion of the truth, as heard in the cynical allegations made in the chamber today. This was an attack on the values of the entire world: when it came to defending the inviolability of borders and combatting human rights violations, nobody could stand aside, all must join together. What was at stake were grave violations of international humanitarian law, and none should be a bystander to Putin’s war. Two-thirds of the General Assembly could suspend the membership of any country deemed to be in violation of its human rights obligations., Some speakers said the Council could not stand silent in the face of the flagrant Russian actions. The humanitarian situation in Ukraine had been provoked entirely by Russia. Russia should implement strictly the provisions of international law, including international human rights law and international humanitarian law. Any further escalation of war propaganda should cease. The worst human rights violations were perpetrated during armed conflict, and the attacks by the Russian armed forces on civilian infrastructure and the use of indiscriminate weapons on civilian areas were against the rules of international conflict. The violation of the human rights of peaceful protestors and the limitations on the freedom of the press in both Russia and Belarus were condemned, as were the limitations placed on the freedom of expression and freedom of dissent. The International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice needed to take action to investigate all reports of war crimes and crimes against humanity., All United Nations Member States had committed themselves to ending war and advancing humanity, speakers said. Human rights abuses and violations could not go unpunished, in particular all violations of the Geneva Conventions. The Council should monitor the situation and document all human rights violations. A comprehensive peaceful solution was vital, in line with international human rights and international humanitarian law, and it was important to give peace a chance. The longer the decision took, the more victims there would be. It was up to the Council to show leadership: the conflict harmed all, and benefited no one, and it was the duty of the Council to respond, although it was hard to find what to say that would or could make a difference. Nevertheless, the international community should respond swiftly and explore all avenues that could lead to an end to the conflict. Many speakers also detailed the humanitarian and financial aid that their countries were providing to Ukraine, as well as offering to take in refugees, with some concluding their statements saying “slava Ukraine” (glory to Ukraine)., A number of speakers raised the cause of the conflict, saying that it was in part due to the hegemonistic policies of the short-lived governments of the West, including the United States and the European Union. It was not up to the Human Rights Council to discuss the situation, given the hypocrisy displayed by that body, and given the human rights violations committed by the Ukrainian Government over previous years. Unilateral coercive measures should not be applied, as they were against human rights and violated countries’ sovereignty.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/human-rights-council-begins-urgent-debate-situation-human-rights-ukraine-stemming

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24.00 2 March 2022 [EN/RU/UK],Situation Report,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,3 Mar 2022,"Civilian casualty report1, From 4am on 24 February 2022 until 12 midnight on 2 March 2022, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 802 civilian casualties in Ukraine: 249 killed (31 men, 27 women, 6 boys, and 3 girls, as well as 8 children and 174 adults whose sex is yet unknown) and 553 injured (45 men, 33 women, 7 girls, and 2 boys, as well as 21 children and 445 adults whose sex is yet unknown)., 337 casualties (68 killed and 269 injured) were recorded in Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 238 (46 killed and 192 injured) in Government-controlled territory, and 99 (22 killed and 77 injured) in territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’., 465 casualties (181 killed and 284 injured) were recorded in other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, and Zhytomyr regions) in places, which were under Government control when casualties occurred., The total number of civilians killed in Ukraine since 24 February 2022 (249) is almost equal to the total number of civilian deaths recorded by OHCHR in the conflict zone of eastern Ukraine from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2021 (253)., Most of civilian casualties recorded from 4am on 24 February 2022 until 12 midnight on 2 March 2022, were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area2, including shelling from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes., OHCHR believes that real figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intensive hostilities have been going on was delayed and many reports were still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, the town of Volnovakha (Government-controlled part of Donetsk region) where mass civilian casualties have been alleged., In this context, OHCHR notes that the Ministry of Health of Ukraine reported 352 persons (338 adults and 14 children) killed, and 1,684 persons (1,568 adults and 116 children) injured as of 27 February. They did not provide disaggregated data regarding civilian and military casualties. On 1 March, the Minister of Health of Ukraine said that 16 children have been killed since 24 February., OHCHR also notes a report by the Ministry of Emergencies of Ukraine, according to which as of 08.00 (Kyiv time) 3 March, the total number of civilian casualties in Kharkiv region was 34 killed and 285 injured, including 10 children., 1 Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available and numbers may change as new information emerges over time.
Since 24 February 2022, in the context of the Russian Federation’s military action in Ukraine, HRMMU has been unable to visit places of incidents and interview victims and witnesses there. All other sources of information have been extensively used, including HRMMU contact persons and partners in places where civilian casualties occurred. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described., 2 The use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area should be avoided in densely populated areas, due to the significant likelihood of indiscriminate effects. Weapons with a wide impact area include: a) munitions with a large destructive radius, such as large bombs or missiles; b) weapons that tend to have an inaccurate delivery system, such as unguided indirect fire weapons, including artillery and mortars; and c) weapons designed to deliver munitions over a wide area, such as multi-launch rocket systems and cluster munitions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-2-march-2022-enruuk
Ukraine: UN experts concerned by reports of discrimination against people of African descent at border,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,3 Mar 2022,"GENEVA (3 March 2022) - The UN Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants note with serious concern ongoing reports of people of African descent and racial and ethnic minorities being subjected to discriminatory treatment as they flee Ukraine. They issue the following statement:, “We recognize the support shown to Africans and people of African descent seeking safety in neighbouring countries including by organizations or individuals of African descent. There have, however, been many reports of officials preventing international students of African descent and their dependents from crossing the Ukrainian border., Several individual and media reports indicate regulation of Ukrainian trains, buses, as well as borders themselves, to deny or delay freedom of movement to people of African descent until all white migrants and asylum seeker have been accommodated. Others have indicated ongoing measures to force people of African descent to the back of queues fleeing the armed conflict., Other reports indicate the racialised denial of entry for people of African descent into some neighbouring countries. Even where they have been granted entry to third countries, people of African descent have reported restrictions including visas issued for two weeks or fewer., The treatment reported — racial preferences in the administration of life-saving services, racial restrictions on freedom of movement, racial differentiation in access to immigration status — violates the prohibition on racial discrimination. This prohibition extends to any treatment, whether it is formal, informal, or ad hoc., The prohibition against racial discrimination is a fundamental right of international law with applicability across situations of conflict and peace. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has stated that under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), regardless of immigration status, it is incumbent upon States Parties to protect the rights of all persons and ensure that immigration policies and/or practices do not discriminate against persons on the basis of their race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin., Even in armed conflict, it is essential that all States uphold these provisions and not detract in any way from the rights and fundamental freedoms recognized under the ICERD, including to preserve the right to life, liberty, dignity, and safety of all people. All human beings are equal in dignity and worth. Measures that differentiate between people, on any ground, especially on the basis of race or ethnicity, are not only legally unjustifiable but morally and ethically repugnant as we embrace our common humanity and fight for fundamental freedoms., It is essential that equal treatment is upheld for all, including people of African descent seeking to depart from Ukraine. This includes by agents of the State, especially border officials. We wish to restate the recent call by our multiple mandates to respect and protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of all persons affected by the armed conflict. We also reiterate the recent call made by UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, that international solidarity is extended without any discrimination based on race, religion or ethnicity. The human rights of Africans and people of African descent must be respected and upheld.”, On 28 February, UN human rights experts issued a statement calling for an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine and the urgent protection of human rights., ENDS, *The experts: The Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent (Ms. Dominique Day, current Chair-Rapporteur; Ms Catherine S.

"Ukraine: UN expert condemns racist threats, xenophobia at border",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,3 Mar 2022,"GENEVA (3 March 2022) – The UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, Tendayi Achiume, today expressed grave concerns about racist threats and xenophobic treatment against non-white people fleeing Ukraine. She issues the following statement:, “I have joined other independent experts in condemning the Russian Federation’s attack on Ukraine, and urging swift action to protect the millions forced to flee this attack. Since then, Black Africans, Indian nationals, Pakistani nationals, people of Middle Eastern descent and others have sent urgent reports documenting life-threatening racist and xenophobic treatment as they attempt to flee the violence in Ukraine., Some report being denied access to bomb shelters within Ukraine, many report border guards preventing them from crossing the border or pushing them to the back of queues for transportation that would grant them safe passage out of the country and, in some cases, they report being denied access to consulates of their countries of origin in neighboring countries. Many — including babies — are being forced to wait longer in below freezing temperatures with no shelter. In all of these cases, these individuals and groups are being singled out for discriminatory treatment through racial, ethnic, and national profiling that is prohibited under international law, even in the context of armed conflict., The reality is that non-white migrants and refugees face deadly discrimination all over the world as they attempt to cross international borders. The images and testimonies from non-white people attempting to flee Ukraine attest to this fact, and they should motivate immediate action to ensure that racist and xenophobic treatment — whether official or unofficial — is brought to an end., In a separate statement, I have joined other independent experts to call attention specifically to the discriminatory treatment of people of African Descent and others. But government officials, humanitarian entities and other actors including the EU and its Member States, must also take urgent action to ensure the protection of all individuals and groups facing racially and ethnically discriminatory treatment as they attempt to flee Ukraine., International law requires non-discriminatory protection of human rights, and all actors must respect this fundamental principle of non-discrimination, especially in times of great crisis., Finally, even as racism and xenophobia continue to heighten the threat faced by non-white people directly affected by the conflict, it is important to acknowledge the tremendous outpouring of support these groups have received, including from private individuals, in the cases where they have been able to cross over to safety. I call on government and humanitarian authorities to ensure safe passage and life-saving protections for all people affected by the conflict.”, ENDS, Ms. E.

These referrals enable my Office to proceed with opening an investigation into the Situation in Ukraine from 21 November 2013 onwards, thereby encompassing within its scope any past and present allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide committed on any part of the territory of Ukraine by any person., I have notified the ICC Presidency a few moments ago of my decision to immediately proceed with active investigations in the Situation. Our work in the collection of evidence has now commenced., As mentioned in my statement of 28 February, in its preliminary examination of the Situation in Ukraine, my Office had already found a reasonable basis to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court had been committed, and had identified potential cases that would be admissible., As I proceed to discharge my responsibilities, I will seek to engage with all relevant stakeholders and parties to the conflict, ensuring that investigations by my Office are conducted objectively and independently, with full respect for the principle of complementarity. In doing so, we will remain focused on our core objective: ensuring accountability for crimes falling within ICC jurisdiction., The support of States Parties and the international community more broadly will be essential as we seek to meet the inherent challenges faced in the conduct of these investigations. I will therefore seek the partnership and contributions of all States in order to address our need for additional resources across all situations addressed by my Office., With an active investigation now underway, I repeat my call to all those engaged in hostilities in Ukraine to adhere strictly to the applicable rules of international humanitarian law. No individual in the Ukraine situation has a licence to commit crimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court., Referral letter submitted in coordination with 38 States Parties

Protection and Human Rights",2 Mar 2022,"2 March 2022 – After weeks of heightened tensions and escalating conflict in eastern Ukraine, on 24 February the Russian Federation began a full-scale military intervention across the country. The armed violence escalated in at least eight oblasts (regions), as well as in eastern oblasts Donetska and Luhanska which were already affected by the conflict. The intense military escalation has resulted in loss of life, injuries and mass movement of civilian population throughout the country and to neighboring countries., Significant damage to infrastructure has left hundreds of thousands of people without electricity and water, while bridges and roads damaged by shelling have left communities cut off from markets for food and other basic supplies. The most pressing humanitarian needs are for emergency medical care, essential medicines, health supplies and equipment, safe water for drinking and hygiene items, and shelter and protection for people displaced from their homes.
Women, children, the elderly, people with disabilities, people living near the line of contact and those living in non-state-controlled areas are currently most in need of assistance.

Protection and Human Rights",3 Mar 2022,"Mariia Shostak is a 25-year-old woman living in Kyiv who started having contractions on 24 February, the day the Russian Federation launched a military offensive in Ukraine., I had a complicated pregnancy so I went to the maternity hospital early so that the child and I would be under doctor supervision. When I woke up on 24 February, my phone’s screen was full of messages from relatives. Even before reading, I realized something had happened. The same morning, I had light contractions. In the afternoon, we were evacuated to the basement shelter for the first time. It was scary. At night, I did not sleep. The contractions intensified, and the news did not give peace., In the early morning of 25 February, a doctor examined me and told me that I would give birth that day. I called my husband at home to come. A trip that normally takes 20 minutes took almost four hours because of queues at the gas station, shop and pharmacy., I was lucky with the birth – it did not happen in the basement though some women gave birth in a room set up for this purpose. I started in the delivery room but had to be transferred to the operating room for a Caesarean section. Later, when air raid sirens went off, the medical staff wanted to evacuate me to the basement, but I refused. Because of the pain, I couldn't even speak, let alone go anywhere. The rest of the time I was disconnected from the outside world, which was probably the only time I forgot about the war., After the operation, I was in intensive care for several hours, no longer on anaesthesia. I was worried that I didn't know where the baby and my husband were. Meanwhile, another air raid siren sounded, and I decided to go down to the basement. I was in a disposable shirt, without shoes, in a wheelchair, holding a urinary catheter. I was covered with a blanket and taken to the shelter, where I first saw my son. We named him Arthur., I felt fear, fatigue and pain. The day after surgery, I went up to the maternity ward and back down to the basement several times a day. Again and again, the air raid siren sounded. I managed to sleep for an hour or two a day. We spent most of the time in the basement sitting in chairs. My back hurt from sitting, and my legs are still swollen as a pregnancy complication. Exhaustion blunted the fear until a projectile hit a high-rise building we could see from our window., My husband, Yurii, helped me, taking care of me and the newborn. Medical staff organized meals in the bunker and later provided beds. They helped put the baby to the breast, shared medicine for babies, held my hand when I had a hard time walking., I feel safe in the capital – there are enough shelters and timely information is coming from the authorities.

Accessing areas most affected by fighting in Ukraine,News and Press Release,MSF,"Health
Water Sanitation Hygiene",3 Mar 2022,"While the number of deaths and injuries rises in Ukraine and hundreds of thousands of people seek refuge in neighbouring countries, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is working to get staff and equipment into areas most affected by the Russian military offensive. Bérengère Guais, deputy head of emergency programmes in Paris, explains the challenges and difficulties of accessing the hardest-hit conflict zones., How is MSF managing to work in Ukraine?, MSF has been present in Ukraine for many years, provid care for people affected by tuberculosis and HIV. So we already have national and international staff on the ground. Today, in the context of war, we have had to suspend these programmes and to reorient our activities to meet the medical needs generated by a large-scale military offensive. We are switching to an emergency intervention from a routine medical project. We therefore have to adapt and call on emergency specialists to work with the people affected by the conflict in the worst-hit areas. This is our priority at the moment., What is the main challenge?, The most important challenge today is accessing the regions most affected by fighting. Since Monday 28 February we have had teams in all of Ukraine's neighbouring countries – Poland, Moldova, Romania as well as in Russia and Belarus. Due to the chaotic situation on Ukraine's borders, with hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the fighting, it is difficult to understand which borders crossings are the best to enter the country. We are looking to bring in equipment and staff – including surgeons – to back up the staff already on the ground and to initiate operations as quickly as possible., How are you managing to get equipment and medicines into the country?, We are currently preparing medical equipment and medicine kits from our logistical bases, notably in Brussels and Bordeaux, which will transit through neighbouring countries before entering Ukraine. We are also purchasing goods and materials in Poland for some local associations who have informed us of a number of essential items that they lack.
We are already seeing a lot of solidarity with refugees... Our priority is therefore to take care of the injured in Ukraine.
-BÉRENGÈRE GUAIS, DEPUTY HEAD OF EMERGENCY PROGRAMMES, How do you assess the needs on the ground?, The combat zones are moving quickly and changing hourly. It is important for us to have a good understanding of the dynamics of the offensive, to assess the needs, but also not to put our teams at risk. We have staff in the capital Kyiv and in several key cities such as Zhytomyr, Severodonetsk, as well as a network of medics in hospitals and health centres in multiple locations. They are enabling us to build a picture of the needs. In particular, we are gathering information about the number of people injured, their needs, and the capacity for care on the ground in order to build an appropriate medical response., To receive supplies within Ukraine we are setting up storage space in the west of the country. Depending on developments and opportunities, we will try to set up warehouses in other areas to expand our capacity., Are there medical posts? How is the referral of injured people being carried out? Is it possible for patients to be transferred from one hospital to another? In which hospital structures could we quickly start activities, especially surgical ones? These are the main questions we are asking ourselves and to which we are trying to get reliable, clear and detailed answers., What support are you providing for refugees in border areas?, We have already donated essential items to a reception centre in Poland and we are working to scale up our response. We are planning to deploy medical support and increase the distribution of blankets and hygiene kits. But we are already seeing a lot of local and international solidarity with the refugees, meaning their needs are well covered for the moment. Our priority is therefore to take care of the injured in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/accessing-areas-most-affected-fighting-ukraine
"Urgent debate of the Human Rights Council on the human rights situation in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression: Statement by Mr. Victor Madrigal-Borloz, Chair of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures",News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",3 Mar 2022,"Geneva, 3 March 2022, Mr President,
Distinguished delegates,
Ladies and gentlemen,, I am delivering this statement on behalf of the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures. As the world continue to watch with despair the disastrous impact of the military attack of the Russian Federation on Ukraine, we salute the decision of the Human Rights Council to hold this urgent debate. In the wake of the landmark decision of the General Assembly to deplore in the strongest terms the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine in violation of Article 2 (4) of the Charter; it is now up to this Council to put human rights squarely in the response to the crisis and contribute to an immediate ceasefire, a de-escalation of tensions and a firm return to diplomacy and dialogue. My colleagues and I are ready to continue assisting this Council and the parties concerned today and in the weeks to come., Throughout their history, the Special Procedures of the United Nations Human Rights Council have gathered, and made available to the members of the Council, persuasive evidence of the inextricable connection between armed conflict and human rights violations. That evidence convinces us of the urgent relevance of assessing this situation through that lens., The furtherance of human rights depends on the respect of fundamental rules of international law, an order that flows from the United Nations Charter. This is no doubt the reason why, over the last few days, you have heard the human rights community coalesce around the defence of that order. Last Monday, 63 Human Rights Experts appointed by this Council and the Chairs of six of the United Nations Human Rights Treaty Bodies expressed in unison our profound outrage and distress at the aggression by the forces of the Russian Federation against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and all people under the Ukrainian jurisdiction. This military attack, which flagrantly violates international law and strikes at the very heart of the spirit and object of the Charter, is fundamentally an attack on the order that enables our work to further human rights and their objective to promote the respect of human dignity., Excellencies;, That human rights should be respected when armed conflict is happening in the foreground is not a theoretical construction. It is painfully concrete to the hundreds who have been killed and wounded as a result of the military attack, and their loved ones. Between 24 February morning and midnight on 1 March, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has recorded 752 civilian casualties. These include 227 killed, among them 15 children, and 525 injured, among them 28 children. Most of these casualties were caused using explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and air strikes, which should not be used in populated areas. These are, I must add, only the casualties OHCHR was able to verify through our colleagues in the field who are working under very challenging circumstances; the actual toll is likely to be much higher. We condemn these grave violations of the right to life, liberty and security in the strongest term., In this and in many other ways, the military invasion carried out by the Russian Federation has caused the people in Ukraine immense suffering and irreparable harm. The consequences of this unprovoked military attack for the protection and promotion of human rights in Ukraine will be profound and long-lasting and the catastrophic and traumatic effects of forced displacement and the destruction of vital infrastructure will last for generations, especially for children for whom the trauma may last a lifetime. A wide range of legal standards apply to armed conflict settings, including those enshrined in humanitarian, human rights, and criminal international law, as well as concrete policy agendas. These systems do not compete or exclude each other but rather coexist with the aim of protecting human dignity, and ongoing proceedings before the International Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights, as well as the announced opening of an investigation by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, clearly show this complementarity., Our hope is that this Council will play its due role in that equation by placing and maintaining human rights at the centre of this response through a series of concrete measures., First, by committing all efforts necessary to ensure due accountability from an evidence-based approach. You have a unique call to harness and reunite, preserve and analyse evidence of the manner in which this unprovoked attack will impact human rights, and it is to be expected that your Special Procedures will receive significant information about the way in which the human cost is to be assessed under international human rights law standards., Second, we call on all members of the international community, especially those providing support and shelter to people fleeing the conflict, to uphold the fundamental principle of non-discrimination. In conflict, populations, communities and peoples historically subjected to discrimination suffer increased exposure to risk, as well as actual damage from that exposure. We are deeply disturbed, for example, that women and children may be disproportionately affected by this war, like all wars, and that women and girls are most exposed to the risk of gender-based and sexual violence; that third country nationals may be subjected to discriminatory treatment as they flee the conflict and denied access to essential assistance; that existing barriers faced by persons with disabilities and older persons will be amplified; and that gender identity and sexual orientation will exacerbate the exposure to violence. Despite the intensity of this crisis, it is primordial to ensure that women are included in decision making on important processes that are important, particularly the humanitarian response as well as any political negotiation process. Similarly, all parties should allow safe and unfettered passage to destinations outside of Ukraine for all those fleeing the conflict and facilitate the rapid, safe and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance for all those in need in Ukraine without discrimination. Several of my colleagues will refer to these issues in more details in upcoming public statements., Furthermore, businesses should be called to engage in heightened human rights due diligence, this call extending to companies in all sectors – from technology companies, to those who have factories in a conflict setting, to the financial sector, consistent with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights., A third element in that human rights-based approach is that, as long as it is safe and practicable, the voices and knowledge of the Ukrainian civil society and Human Rights Defenders must be given a fundamental place., At the same time, we echo the words of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly as we face what could become Europe’s worst humanitarian and refugee crisis in decades. According to the latest briefings by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, above one million refugees, mainly Ukrainians and third country nationals, have now fled Ukraine to neighbouring countries. Moreover, around one million people have been internally displaced within Ukraine, many of whom are beyond the reach of humanitarian assistance due to the volatile security context, threats against humanitarian workers, and restrictions imposed on their movement. And these numbers will continue to grow., Mr. President,, This Council is also called to deal with an array of human rights challenges around the world. We trust your leadership to ensure that the current focus on the urgent situation will not detract from attention to freedoms of assembly, association, and expression in the Russian Federation. Our vigilant peers have already warned this Council on restrictions to fundamental freedoms within the Russian Federation, which are particularly alarming. Peaceful anti-war demonstrators continue to be arbitrarily arrested, with reports suggesting some 7000 people have been arrested since Thursday last week. We call for all those arrested and detained to be treated consistently with the Russian Federation’s international human rights obligations and be released without further delay. In addition, the threat posed to the environment by the armed conflict, with areas reportedly contaminated by radiation, is also a source of deep concern., Mr. President,, We strongly urge the Russian Federation to listen to the collective voices of the international community which is now speaking unanimously and saying unequivocally that these military actions are unacceptable to all. As human rights experts, my colleagues and I urge the Russian Federation to observe and respect international law; to end hostilities immediately and unconditionally; to stop immediately all human rights violations stemming from the attack; to enable human rights defenders in Ukraine and in the Russian Federation to carry out their peaceful work; to facilitate the immediate and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance without any discrimination as to nationality, race, and ethnicity; and to restore the ability of the people in Ukraine to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms without military or external interference., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/urgent-debate-human-rights-council-human-rights-situation-ukraine-stemming-russian

"ACLED Regional Overview – Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (19-25 February 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,3 Mar 2022,"Last week in Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The invasion prompted demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine across the region, including in Russia, where they were met with a heavy police response. Clashes continued on the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact. Farmer demonstrations also continued in several countries., Months of Russian military buildup near the border with Ukraine, and the recent escalation of the war in the Donbas region, culminated in a full-scale invasion on 24 February. Hours before the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “special military operation” in Ukraine, accusing NATO of closing in on Russia’s borders and Ukraine of “militarization and nazification” (Al Jazeera, 24 February 2022). Russian troops breached the Ukrainian border from the north, east, and south, and launched missiles targeting major Ukrainian cities, such as Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kramatorsk, Odesa, as well as airports in Lutsk, and Ivano-Frankivsk. Despite Russian claims that armed attacks have only been directed against military facilities, Russian forces also targeted civilian infrastructure, bombing hospitals, residential areas, and kindergartens in several cities (Washington Post, 25 February 2022). Last week, there were 134 battles and 540 shelling incidents reported across the country. In response to the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy declared martial law (Independent, 24 February 2022)., The invasion drove a 341% increase in violence in the country over the past week relative to the past month, as flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map. The tool first warned of increased violence to come in the country last month. Meanwhile, in the Donbas region, there was a 246% increase in violence in Donetsk and a 363% increase in violence in Luhansk in the past week relative to the past month, as flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Surge Tracker, which first warned of increased violence to come in Donetsk last month., Belarus became an arena from which Russian troops could attack Ukraine from the north and attempt to surround the capital city, Kyiv. Russian military forces used Belarusian bases and Belarusian airspace around Minsk and in the Gomel region to launch and direct missiles at Ukrainian cities (RFE/RL, 26 February 2022)., Other neighboring countries, namely Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova, experienced a large influx of refugees from Ukraine, as more than half a million people fled the war across land borders (Euronews, 27 February 2022). In response to the crisis, the Moldovan government introduced a state of emergency alongside a range of restrictions, including the closure of its airspace, increased police presence across the country, and banning public protests (Ziarul de Gardă, 24 February 2022). The European Commission has asked the 27 EU national governments to trigger a blanket protection for Ukrainian refugees (New York Times, 2 March 2022). This will grant those fleeing Ukraine, both nationals and long-term residents, the right to live, study, and work in the EU for up to three years. Non-Ukrainians living in the country have reported racist treatment at the border when trying to cross, however. A number of Black, South Asian, and Mediterranean refugees have shared accounts of being denied transport or being blocked from crossing into the European Union, while white Ukrainians were let through – which has been corroborated by the United Nations’ High Commissioner for Refugees (Independent, 1 March 2022). The EU also imposed a set of sanctions on Russia last week, including sanctions targeting the Russian energy sector, as well as the exclusion of some Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system for international payments. The EU also blocked Russian state-owned television network Russia Today and news agency Sputnik (Reuters, 27 February 2022)., Moreover, Russia’s invasion sparked demonstrations across the region — as well as around the world — in support of Ukraine last week. In Russia, demonstrations denouncing the Russian invasion were held in at least 38 cities on the evening of 24 February. Police intervened to disperse the overwhelming majority of demonstrations, detaining and beating protesters. The largest demonstrations took place in Moscow and St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Perm, and Krasnodar (OVD Info, 24 February 2022). Demonstrations continued the next day in at least 13 cities, though were smaller in size (OVD Info, 25 February 2022). Demonstrations against Russian military aggression were also held in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Greece, Finland, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Moldova, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom., Along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, clashes continued throughout last week, including three clashes in Martuni within the de facto Republic of Artsakh. These trends contribute to the 100% increase in violence in Martuni last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Surge Tracker, which first warned of increased violence to come in Martuni last month. Ongoing ceasefire violations came as Azerbaijan and Russia signed a declaration on allied cooperation between the two countries on 22 February. The declaration foresees, inter alia, a deepened interaction between the Azerbaijani and Russian armed forces, provision of military equipment, and joint efforts in countering international security threats (Azertag, 22 February 2022). The declaration came just hours after Russia’s recognition of independence of two rebel-held republics in eastern Ukraine and only two days before the invasion of Ukraine. The timing raises suspicions that Russian President Putin sought to ensure Azerbaijan’s loyalty before embarking on a war with Ukraine (Eurasianet, 24 February 2022)., On the Belarusian-Polish border, the migrant crisis continued last week, contributing to the 102% increase in violence in the Podlaskie border region over the past month relative to the past year, as flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Threat Tracker. The tool first warned of increased violence to come in Podlaskie last month. Polish border guards continue to report attempts by migrants to cross the border from Belarus, prompting clashes between migrants and Polish police and military forces. These migrants are predominantly refugees from Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan (The Guardian, 8 February 2022). Both Polish and Belarusian forces have been accused of human rights abuses against migrants stranded at the border (The Guardian, 8 February 2022). The treatment of these refugees comes in stark contrast to the treatment of Ukrainian refugees (PBS, 28 February 2022). At least 280,000 Ukrainian refugees have already been welcomed into Poland less than a week since the start of the Russian invasion, many of which have been accepted into Poland without passports (Vox, 2 March 2022)., Meanwhile, farmer demonstrations continued in several countries last week, amid sustained increases in agricultural production costs. In France, farmers staged protests in front of several supermarkets at the call of Young Farmers (JA) and the National Federation of Farmers Union (FNSEA), demanding the revalorization of prices to account for increasing production costs. In doing so, demonstrating farmers referenced their right to just remuneration, as outlined in the EGalim 2 bill (Ministry of Agriculture and Food, March 2022). In Italy, haulers and farmers carried out road blockades, slow-paced rides, and gatherings — mostly in the Southern regions — to protest against the increase in oil and gas prices. In Spain, farmers drove tractors in caravan demonstrations and used them as roadblocks in demonstrations against high production costs. In Extremadura, an autonomous community in Spain, a demonstration in Don Benito on 22 February turned violent as demonstrators clashed with police during an official visit by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to the town. Global stress on the food supply chain; environmental impacts on big agricultural producers, such as Brazil and the United States; as well as unprecedented demand from China; have all contributed to the inflation costs that farmers in Europe are currently facing (Irish Examiner, 23 February 2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-19-25-february-2022
"As one million refugees flee across the border, IRC highlights unacceptable breaches of International Humanitarian Law in Ukraine",News and Press Release,IRC,Protection and Human Rights,2 Mar 2022,"New York, NY, March 2, 2022 — As the number of refugees from Ukraine seeking safety in neighboring countries reaches an alarming 1 million, the IRC is calling out continued breaches of International Humanitarian Law and discriminatory treatment of individuals displaced by the conflict., As Russia's military offensive intensifies in major Ukrainian cities, the IRC is calling out the completely unacceptable, deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, as residential buildings and hospitals are hit and thousands of people are left without adequate water, electricity and access to markets where roads and bridges have been destroyed. The IRC strongly supports and echoes the UN Secretary General's call on Russia to adhere to International Humanitarian Law, especially the protection of civilians and vulnerable groups such as women and girls., The IRC also is extremely concerned about reports of discriminatory treatment of individuals of all backgrounds attempting to flee from Ukraine. All people seeking safety from the crisis must be granted safe and regular pathways to safety, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, or religion., David Miliband, President and CEO at the International Rescue Committee (IRC) said, ""In the cities and streets of Ukraine today, innocent civilians are bearing witness to our Age of Impunity. The fact that 1 million refugees have already been forced to flee is a grim testament to barbaric military tactics taking aim at homes and hospitals. The IRC is calling on the Russian government to immediately cease all violations of the laws of war to spare additional harm to civilians and avoid further displacement., ""Reports of pushbacks of individuals of African and Asian origin at the Ukrainian border must also be condemned in the strongest terms. Discrimination and unfair treatment of refugees is always intolerable, but it is especially so when conflict is intensifying in urban areas and violations of international humanitarian law are mounting by the hour. Seeking asylum is a human right, and it is our moral imperative to give refuge to those fleeing for their lives no matter their race, religion, color or creed., ""As war rages across Ukraine and the world bears witness to a displacement crisis at a scale rarely seen in history, it is urgent that Europe not just offer protection to Ukrainian nationals who have visa-free access to the EU, but to also grant non discriminatory pathways to safety to people of all citizenship and nationalities facing grave dangers inside Ukraine."", In Poland, which is preparing to receive up to 1 million refugees, the IRC is working to scale up support to the government and civil society and to provide for the basic needs of people fleeing the conflict. The IRC is working partners in Poland and Ukraine that are quickly mobilizing resources to provide critical support to civilians forced to flee their homes.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/one-million-refugees-flee-across-border-irc-highlights-unacceptable-breaches

"Ukraine: High Commissioner cites ""new and dangerous"" threats to human rights",News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,3 Mar 2022,"49th session of the Human Rights Council, Urgent debate on the situation of human rights in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression, Statement by Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 3 March 2022, Distinguished President,
Excellencies,
Colleagues and Friends,, One week ago, the Russian Federation's military attack on Ukraine opened a new and dangerous chapter in world history., The Secretary-General has termed this ""the most serious global peace and security crisis in recent years""; he added, ""a country has been thrown into chaos; a region has been upended; and the reverberations are being felt around the world."", The attack that began on 24 February is generating massive impact on the human rights of millions of people across Ukraine. Elevated threat levels for nuclear weapons underline the gravity of the risks to all of humanity., Military operations are escalating further as we speak, with military strikes on and near large cities, including Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Lysychansk, Sievierodonetsk, Sumy, Mariupol and Zhytomyr, and the capital, Kyiv. The town of Volnovakha in Donetsk region has been almost completely destroyed by shelling, and its remaining residents have been hiding in basements., By Tuesday night, my Office had recorded and confirmed 752 civilian casualties, including 227 killed – 15 of them children. At least 525 have been injured, including 28 children. I will disaggregate these figures in terms of the regions affected: 323 casualties (65 killed and 258 injured) were recorded in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. 429 casualties (162 killed and 267 injured) were recorded in other regions of Ukraine – the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, and Zhytomyr regions., I must emphasize that the real figures will be far higher, since numerous other casualties are pending confirmation, and information from some areas engaged in intense hostilities has been delayed. A member of the OSCE Monitoring Unit in Ukraine was killed last night in Kharkiv while getting supplies for her family. We grieve all the deaths that have occurred., Most civilian casualties were caused by the use of heavy artillery, multi-launch rocket systems and air strikes in populated areas, with concerning reports of use of cluster munitions striking civilian targets. Massive damage to residential buildings has been inflicted. The use of weapons with wide area effects in populated urban areas risks being inherently indiscriminate, and I call for the immediate cessation of such force., There has also been substantial damage to a significant number of civilian objects, including a hospital, schools and kindergartens. Essential infrastructure has been heavily damaged – cutting off critical supplies and services, including electricity, water and access to healthcare. On 26 February, Russian troops near Kherson reportedly fired on an ambulance that was transporting seriously wounded victims; the driver was killed and one paramedic was injured., Over two million people have been forced to flee their homes. One million, according to UNHCR estimates, are internally displaced. A further 1,040,000 refugees have sought safety in neighbouring countries in the past seven days – often after travelling for days by bicycle or on foot, in freezing conditions. UNHCR has estimated that up to four million people could leave the country in the coming weeks if the conflict continues., I commend the welcome that Ukrainians leaving the country have received. This welcome must be extended to all those fleeing conflict, regardless of their citizenship, ethnicity, migration or other status. There have been disturbing indications of discrimination against African and Asian nationals while fleeing, and the Office will be watching this situation attentively., Tens of millions of people remain in the country, in potentially mortal danger. I am deeply concerned that the current escalation of military operations will further heighten the harm they face. Thousands of people, including older people, pregnant women, as well as children and people with disabilities, are being forced to gather in underground shelters and subway stations to escape explosions. Many people in situations of vulnerability are separated from families and effectively trapped. My staff in Ukraine have been contacted by several groups who fear persecution if Russian troops advance, including members of the Crimean Tatar community in mainland Ukraine, as well as prominent human rights defenders and journalists., Excellencies,, We are here to demonstrate and uphold our commitment to multilateralism and human rights. I echo the powerful call by the General Assembly yesterday for an immediate resolution of the conflict through peaceful means., States must abide by international law and the core principles that protect human life and human dignity., It is imperative that full access for the delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians across the entire country be enabled., I also strongly urge the full protection of civilians, as well as captured soldiers, as required under international humanitarian law., It is a reality that, in armed conflict, there are incidents that violate the binding norms of international armed conflict. It is in all States’ interest to ensure that those standards are met, and that there is due accountability where they are not., I note that, at the international level, the International Court of Justice has been formally seized of proceedings connected to the conflict, and will begin hearings Monday on a request for provisional measures. In addition, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has announced his decision to immediately proceed with active investigations on the situation in Ukraine, following referrals by a broad number of States. And this Council has before it an important proposal, building on established practice, to widen accountability avenues through an independent international commission of inquiry., The Office has for eight years extensively and consistently monitored the human rights situation in Ukraine with particular focus on the regions of the Donbas engaged in conflict, as well as the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, which have been occupied by the Russian Federation since 2014. The 40 reports the Office has published are publicly accessible, and document violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by multiple actors over that period., Our human rights monitors will continue to operate across the country to the full extent of their capacity. I believe this crisis demonstrates the vital importance of our objective monitoring and reporting in Ukraine – and in many other countries – and I take this opportunity to publicly thank the staff of the Office, particularly our colleagues in the field, for their dedication., Excellencies,, As the Secretary-General has said, the UN Charter has always ""stood firm on the side of peace, security, development, justice, international law and human rights – and time after time, when the international community has rallied together in solidarity, those values have prevailed."", It is vital that they prevail today, in Ukraine – and elsewhere., My thoughts are with all people who suffer unbearable fear, pain and deprivation because of the senseless destruction of warfare., Thank you, Mr President.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-high-commissioner-cites-new-and-dangerous-threats-human-rights

Immediate ceasefire needed to aid civilians in Ukraine,News and Press Release,NRC,Protection and Human Rights,3 Mar 2022,"Statement by Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council:, “We call for an immediate truce that can end hostilities and enable life-saving relief. This ceasefire must end the fierce fighting in and around densely populated areas across Ukraine, which paralyzes the humanitarian work of aid organisations on the ground. We cannot come to the relief of vulnerable communities engulfed by war when our aid workers are in bomb shelters and fleeing from attacks., We cannot save lives under a hail of bombs and grenades., The elderly, the disabled and families with children are stuck in towns under airstrikes and shelling without safe passage and no means of transportation. Millions are now in frontline locations. With empty shops, overwhelmed healthcare, and no electricity or safe water, local and international aid groups on the ground must urgently resume our work., There are mounting numbers of civilian casualties across the country, disproportionally reported from Eastern Ukraine, where I visited in early February. These areas have more elderly, disabled and isolated communities than elsewhere. Families with children and elderly pensioners cannot escape the inferno they are living through., Our courageous humanitarian colleagues on the ground tell us of continuous horrific attacks and fighting since the start of the invasion. It is now increasingly difficult for their families to find food and other vital necessities, because empty shops are not resupplied. People are cut off from electricity, water, healthcare, and basic services and have to spend days and nights in bunkers. Local communities are trying to organise themselves and support the most vulnerable, but are often unable to do so due to the lack of fuel., The madness must stop. The men who started this war sit in safe and comfortable offices. They can end it today and resume meaningful political talks. Defenceless civilians are paying the highest price for their senseless war.”, For more information or to arrange an interview, please contact:

Photo by Dan Stewart/Save the Children. More content available here and here., At least 400,000 children are on the move across Eastern Europe and at risk of hunger, illness, trafficking and abuse, Save the Children said today, as the number of people fleeing the Russian military operation in Ukraine passed one million., Save the Children estimates that at least 40% [i] of the people who have fled Ukraine to Romania, Poland, Moldova, Hungary, Slovakia and Lithuania, to seek safety are children, some arriving with nothing but the clothes on their back., The United Nations, reporting that one million people have now crossed the borders, said this scale of movement by people could become “Europe’s largest refugee crisis this century”. This number does not include those displaced within Ukraine., The massive exodus has led to 24-hour queues at border checkpoints with refugees being sheltered in repurposed schools once they get out of Ukraine as well as in private homes, makeshift camps, and conference centres, but this has raised concerns for children., Anna*, 29, has fled to Romania with her four-year-old daughter Daryna* and two-year-old son Danilo*. They fled their home in Ukraine when fighting approached a nuclear power station, alongside Anna’s sister and mother., Anna said: “We fled because we were scared. There was bombing in the area. The airport had been bombed and fighting was getting near to a nuclear power station., “On the way we saw planes overhead and the roads were very busy. We saw rockets being fired and destroying buildings. There were sirens blaring constantly. My husband stayed behind. He drove us to the border before going back. We could only bring a few clothes and some medicines., “The children don’t understand what’s happening. But we feel very bad.”, Anna told Save the Children about the reaction of her daughter Daryna: “Sometimes when she heard bangs she’d say she was scared. When we were running to hide in the cellar she said she was scared and talked about tanks coming. We just hope the fighting will end and we can return home.”, Anna hopes they can continue onto Czech Republic where they have friends who can help them., Irina Saghoyan, Save the Children’s Eastern Europe Director, said: “We know that when children are on the move, they are at heightened risk of trafficking, abuse including sexual violence and serious psychological distress., “It is also unconscionable that some children and their families are forced to be outside with no shelter in such freezing temperatures. We are incredibly worried about the risks of illnesses like hypothermia., “This is before we even start to comprehend the enormous impact of the events of the past week on these children’s mental wellbeing. Their homes, schools and communities have been destroyed, they have been separated from family and friends – their entire lives and everything they hold dear have been ripped from them in the space of a week., “For now, it is vital that all these children entering neighbouring countries are protected, and have access to life-saving food, clean water, shelter and mental health support. But the catastrophe that we are seeing unfold before our eyes will not stop until the violence stops and children and their families are safe. In every conflict it is children who bear the brunt and this needs to stop.”, Anna and her children stayed at a temporary camp before moving to a Reception Centre where they are now staying and where Save the Children runs child friendly spaces, where children can play and recover from the traumatic experiences they have been through., Save the Children also provides families like Anna’s with advice and information, as well as food and other essentials., The Children’s Emergency Fund allows Save the Children to respond to wherever the need is greatest to reach children quickly with the essentials they need to survive., *names have been changed, More content available here and here., DONATE TO OUR CHILDREN'S EMERGENCY FUND WHICH ALLOWS SAVE THE CHILDREN TO RESPOND WHEREVER THE NEED IS GREATEST TO REACH CHILDREN QUICKLY WITH THE ESSENTIALS THEY NEED TO SURVIVE., NOTES TO EDITORS:, For further enquiries please contact:, Emily Wight, Emily.Wight@savethechildren.org, Our media out of hours (BST) contact is media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409, [i] On average, children usually make up 39% of the refugee population, and in this case, because men are staying behind in Ukraine, the proportion of children is likely to be far higher.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/children-don-t-understand-what-s-happening-least-400000-children-fleeing-ukraine-risk

Protection and Human Rights
Safety and Security",3 Mar 2022,"Russian troops invaded Ukrainian territory on 24 February. The initial strategy is believed to have been rapid capture of large populated areas, notably the capital Kyiv and Kharkiv, a city of around 1.4 million inhabitants. These however largely remain in Ukrainian hands and, likely in consequence, Russian forces have started to resort to much more extensive use of explosive weapons in these populated areas., Insecurity Insight’s monitoring for the period 24 February-02 March 2022 has identified reports of 24 incidents where explosive weapons damaged hospitals. A doctor, ambulance driver and medical student have been reportedly killed in attacks. The armed violence has also hindered access to health care or forced health care providers to change how they were able to provide services. The conflict has also affected supply of drugs and other key medical supplies with crucial shortages for patients with long-term care needs., As the violence has impacted health workers, hospitals, ambulances and patients, a number of medical organisations have released statements of concern: The International Council of Nurses and Physicians for Human Rights and the European Federation of Nurses Associations Reported incidents have been included in this list, when careful examination of sources did not give any reason to doubt that the event happened where and when it was reported to have occured.

Discrimination and Racism Against Third Country Nationals Fleeing Ukraine Must End: IOM Director General,News and Press Release,IOM,Protection and Human Rights,3 Mar 2022,"Geneva - I am alarmed about verified credible reports of discrimination, violence and xenophobia against third country nationals attempting to flee the conflict in Ukraine., Let me be clear, discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, nationality or migration status is unacceptable. I deplore any such acts and call on States to investigate this issue and address it immediately., Men, women and children from dozens of nationalities, including migrant workers and students living in Ukraine are facing acute challenges as they attempt to leave conflict-affected areas, cross borders into neighboring countries and seek life-saving assistance., We are receiving reports of discrimination resulting in heightened risk and suffering., Neighboring States need to ensure that all those fleeing Ukraine, are granted unhindered access to territory, regardless of status and in accordance with International Humanitarian Law. Protection and immediate assistance must be provided in a non-discriminatory and culturally appropriate manner, in line with the humanitarian imperative, to all conflict affected people throughout their journey to safety., I welcome the European Commission’s proposal to activate the Temporary Protection Directive to assist people fleeing Ukraine and call on Member States to ensure the inclusion of third country nationals in such protection measures., In all cases, IOM is committed and ready to assist its Member States and partners to ensure an inclusive response to the humanitarian needs and crisis in Ukraine in line with internationally recognized practices captured by the Guidelines to Protect Migrants in Countries Experiencing Conflict or Natural Disaster., For More Information, please contact:, Safa Msehli, smsehli@iom.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/discrimination-and-racism-against-third-country-nationals-fleeing-ukraine-must-end

"Europe's official, media handling of Ukrainian crisis exposes deep-rooted, racist policy against non-Europeans [EN/AR]",News and Press Release,Euro-Med Monitor,Protection and Human Rights,2 Mar 2022,"Geneva -- The official and media European positions towards the Ukraine crisis, which resulted in a refugee crisis, have exposed a deep-rooted racist European policy that excludes and discriminates against non-European ethnicities, Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor said in a statement on Wednesday., Over the past days, the security authorities in Ukraine and Poland and other European politicians and journalists showed several forms of racism and discrimination based on race, color, and religion against refugees fleeing the war Russia launched on Ukraine on 24 February., Euro-Med Monitor's team viewed testimonies and videos showing that the Polish border guard follow discriminatory policy against non-Europeans, by impeding the crossing of Africans while allowing Ukrainians to cross and providing them with food and first aid., Michela Pugliese, migration and asylum researcher at Euro-Med Monitor, said: ""While European countries welcome Ukrainian refugees and provide them with official and safe transit routes, seven asylum seekers of non-European ethnicity died yesterday after their boat sank in the Mediterranean off the coasts of Greece."", ""Safe routes should be provided to all migrants and asylum seekers, regardless of their race, religion, or nationality,"" she added., Students and residents of Arab and African nationalities in Ukraine told Euro-Med Monitor that they were forced to sit for long hours at the Polish border without any help, and some of them---especially with black skin---were prevented from crossing without reasons and remained stuck at the borders. At the same time, great facilities were provided to white Ukrainians, who were allowed to cross without visas and travel by train without tickets., Indians residing in Ukraine also said that they faced great difficulties when fleeing the country, as they were not allowed to board the trains, and their crossing was delayed, while the Ukrainians were allowed to cross first., Discrimination also extended to include official political levels, as the Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said: ""These people are intelligent, they are educated people.... This is not the refugee wave we have been used to, people we were not sure about their identity, people with unclear pasts, who could have been even terrorists."", Major European countries showed flexibility, welcomed Ukrainian refugees, and issued decisions to facilitate their reception and residence, in stark contrast to the policy of expulsion and pushback they followed when dealing with asylum seekers from the Middle East and North Africa, which also witness violent conflicts---more severe than the Russian-Ukrainian conflict sometimes., European journalists and media outlets used a racist discourse, focusing on the fact that Ukrainian refugees are civilized, unlike refugees from the Middle East and North Africa who have been stigmatized as terrorists and uncivilized., For instance, Charlie D'Agata, CBS's foreign correspondent, said on TV: ""This isn't a place, with all due respect, like Iraq or Afghanistan, that has seen conflict raging for decades... This is a relatively civilized, relatively European --- I have to choose those words carefully, too --- city, where you wouldn't expect that or hope that it's going to happen."", Although the correspondent apologized after a wave of widespread criticism on social media platforms, his statements reflect the views and impressions of a large segment of journalists who spoke about the crisis with similar expressions., Similarly, Peter Dobbie, a presenter for Al Jazeera English, made a seemingly discriminatory comparison between Ukrainian refugees and refugees from the Middle East and North Africa, saying: ""What is compelling is that just looking at them, the way they're dressed. These are prosperous, middle-class people. These are not obviously refugees trying to get away from areas in the Middle East that are still in a big state of war. These are not people trying to get away from areas in North Africa. They look like any European family that you would live next door to."", Journalist Philip Korb on BFM, one of France's most watched channels, said on air, ""We're not talking here about Syrians fleeing the bombing of the Syrian regime backed by Putin, we're talking about Europeans leaving in cars that look like ours to save their lives."", Meanwhile, on Britain's ITV, a correspondent in Poland said: ""This is not a developing third world nation. This is Europe."", Racist statements also came from people other than journalists. The BBC hosted the former Ukrainian Deputy Prosecutor, David Sakvarelidze, who said: ""It's very emotional for me because I see European people with blue eyes and blonde hair being killed, children being killed every day by [Russian President] Putin's missiles, helicopters, and rockets."", While Euro-Med Monitor expresses full solidarity with the civilian victims of the war in Ukraine, especially the fleeing refugees, the abhorrent duplicity in the European security, political, and media dealings with the humanitarian crises resulting from this war is reprehensible., All these practices are forms of racial discrimination according to Article 1 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which defines it as ""any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life."", European Union and European countries' humane treatment of refugees should include refugees of different races, religions, and nationalities, away from double standards in dealing with humanitarian issues that indicate a deep value regression, dangerous discriminatory thought, and an ignorance to fundamental human rights principles., The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination should investigate the reports and testimonies about racial discrimination practices in dealing with those fleeing the war in Ukraine., All conflicting parties should respect the rules of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions during the war to avoid endangering civilians and distance them from all hostilities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/europes-official-media-handling-ukrainian-crisis-exposes-deep-rooted-racist-policy
"Attacks on children in Ukraine must stop, with safe passage for all",News and Press Release,Plan International,Protection and Human Rights,2 Mar 2022,"The humanitarian crisis faced by children caught up in the Ukraine conflict is multiplying by the hour and children are at risk., Stephen Omollo, Chief Executive of Plan International, said:, ""The humanitarian crisis faced by children caught up in the Ukraine conflict is multiplying by the hour. Each day of continued fighting means countless more lives, homes and childhoods uprooted.

Countless have been displaced inside the country., And unless there is an immediate end to the conflict, millions more are likely to be forced to flee Ukraine., Inside Ukraine, our staff – and other humanitarians – are working where and when they can in frightening conditions. Our staff stay, even at great risk, because we know the needs in the country are huge., Despite the extraordinary pace and challenges, the response from governments and local communities in receiving this one million refugees has been remarkable. UNHCR staff have already moved in throughout the region and are scaling up our protection and assistance programmes for refugees, in support of host governments., International solidarity has been heartwarming. But nothing – nothing – can replace the need for the guns to be silenced; for dialogue and diplomacy to succeed.

PAX calls to stop using cluster munitions in order to prevent civilian harm,News and Press Release,PAX,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",2 Mar 2022,"PAX is shocked by reports on the use of cluster munitions by Russian troops in Ukraine. More and more reports are coming in that cluster munitions have been fired at civilian targets in cities in Ukraine, including Kharkiv. Cluster munitions mainly cause casualties among civilians, often for many years after a war. This is also the reason why the majority of states worldwide are party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions that prohibits the use of cluster munitions. Neither Russia nor Ukraine is yet a party to the treaty.
PAX calls on all parties to never use these outlawed weapons., Use of cluster munitions against civilians in Ukraine, Various sources show that cluster munitions have been used in Russian attacks during the war in Ukraine. Human Rights Watch reported an attack with cluster munitions on a hospital; Amnesty International accounts that such weapons were also used in an attack against a kindergarten. Research collective Bellingcat keeps track of where this banned weapon has been used and has already identified several cases., Dozens of civilians have already been killed and wounded as a direct result of these cluster munitions attacks. Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wopke Hoekstra, denounced the indiscriminate cluster munition attacks as war crimes., Stop cluster munitions
Cluster munitions are bombs, grenades or rockets that scatter several small bomblets, so-called submunitions. The small bombs explode when they hit the ground. But not all of them; many remain in place without exploding and can still kill and maim people decades after a conflict., The use of cluster bombs is highly controversial because they cause civilian casualties, not only during use, but also as a result of unexploded sub-munitions that can still explode., Cluster bombs have been declared illegal by more and more countries: more than 120 countries have signed up to the important Cluster Munitions Convention. Nevertheless, in states that are not party to the treaty, such as Russia, cluster bombs are still being produced. Russia has in recent years also used cluster bombs in Syria., PAX, as a member of the international coalition ICBL-CMC, has been working since 2009 to end the global production and trade of cluster munitions, while focusing on the role of financial institutions. We research investments in companies that produce cluster munitions and ask financial institutions to adopt policies that prevent such investments. A large part of the companies that produce cluster bombs have now stopped doing so. The recent use of cluster munitions in Ukraine and Syria by Russia once again shows the importance of stopping money flows to producers of cluster munitions., Protect civilians against armed violence
PAX reiterates its call on all warring parties to protect civilians against the controversial use of weapons. It is not only the use of cluster munitions in Ukraine that causes us great concern. The widespread use of other explosive weapons with wide area effects, such as MLRS, puts civilians in towns and villages at great risk.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/pax-calls-stop-using-cluster-munitions-order-prevent-civilian-harm

Shelter and Non-Food Items",3 Mar 2022,"Protection of Civilians, • The protection situation in Ukraine is extremely volatile following the military offensive across the country. Between 24 February-01 March, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 688 civilian casualties in Ukraine, 44% of which took place in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. At least 180 killed (26 men, 21 women, 4 boys, 3 girls, as well as 6 children and 120 adults whose sex is yet unknown) and 508 injured (37 men, 29 women, 7 girls, 2 boys, as well as 19 children and 414 adults whose sex is yet unknown). Figures are believed to be higher, especially in Government controlled areas, albeit figures are difficult to corraborate, due to ongoing hostilities across the county.

Based on a triangulation of data available at open sources, the Protection Cluster estimates that at least 1 million persons have been newly displaced inside Ukraine. It is projected that over the next few months, over 6.7M people may become internally displaced., • It is estimated that 12 M people living in affected areas are stranded, or unwilling or unable to leave due to the military action and heightened security risks, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation. Establishing safe pathways for their evacuation and relocation is an urgent priority to protect their lives., •According to UNHCR, as of 2 March 2022, around 875,000 refugees have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries due to the impact of the military offensive.

The majority of new IDPs come from Kharkiv, Donetsk, Kherson and Dnipro Oblasts, but also from Zaporizhya, Sumy, Chernihivi and Kyiv. At least 30% of the new IDP arrivals indicated the intention to continue moving further away to other locations., • Most vulnerable profiles among IDPs identified so far include children, women and girls at risk, persons with disabilities and older people. Main reported protection risks to which the population is currently exposed include primarily family separation due to displacement as a result of the military action hostilities, exposure to shelling and restrictions on freedom of movement. Lack of access to education and lack of access to State Social Services were also reported, especially in areas still affected by active hostilities., • Persons living with disabilities, including children, are reportedly facing increased horrendous conditions. Partners members of the Cluster’s Technical Working Group on Age and Disability report that shelters in Kyiv are inaccessible, resulting in persons with disabilities being forced to stay home without access to information, awaiting a safer option.

Power outages, unstable telecommunications in certain locations are also limiting people’s access to hotlines and information. In locations along the contact line and severely affected by military hostilities, non-operational banking services limit partner’s capacity to provide cash-based interventions., • For those already evacuated or displaced, support to scale-up reception capacities in places of arrivals of IDPs is another urgent need, including the possibility of provision of essential protection services such as psycho-social support and individual counselling.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/protection-cluster-ukraine-crisis-protection-snapshot-25-february-1-march-2022

The Ukraine Crisis Double Standards: Has Europe’s Response to Refugees Changed?,News and Press Release,GDP,Protection and Human Rights,2 Mar 2022,"Global Detention Project, 2 March 2022, During the 2015 refugee ""crisis,"" the EU called for detaining arriving refugees for up to 18 months. Not so today in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The reasons for this difference point to an intractable challenge in Europe's ability to embrace the international refugee protection regime., Russia's invasion of Ukraine has triggered one of the largest and fastest refugee movements that Europe has witnessed since the end of World War II.[1] By 2 March, only seven days into the war, 874,000 people were estimated to have fled to neighbouring countries. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has predicted that as many as four million people could flee the country in the coming weeks.[2] The European Union (EU) puts this number higher, estimating that there may eventually be seven million refugees.[3] Regardless which number is correct, it is now abundantly clear that an unprecedented refugee challenge is unfolding in Europe., While the EU calls this the largest humanitarian crisis that Europe has witnessed in ""many, many years,""[4] it is important to remember that it was not so long ago that the continent faced another critical humanitarian challenge, the 2015 refugee ""crisis"" spurred by the conflict in Syria. But the starkly different responses---to date---that Europe has directed at these two situations provide a cautionary lesson for those hoping for a more humane, generous Europe. The differences also help explain why some of those fleeing Ukraine---in particular, nationals from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East---are not getting the same generous treatment as the citizens of Ukraine., As of this writing, Ukraine's neighbours have responded with an outpouring of public and political support for the refugees. Political leaders have said publicly that refugees from Ukraine are welcome and countries have been preparing to receive refugees on their borders with teams of volunteers handing out food, water, clothing, and medicines.[5] Slovakia[6] and Poland[7] have said that refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine will be allowed to enter their countries even without passports, or other valid travel documents; other EU countries, such as Ireland, have announced the immediate lifting of visa requirements for people coming from Ukraine.[8], Across Europe, free public transport[9] and phone communication[10] is being provided for Ukrainian refugees. The EU is proposing to reactivate the Temporary Protection Directive, introduced in the 1990s to manage large-scale refugee movements during the Balkans crisis.[11] Under this scheme, refugees from Ukraine would be offered up to three years temporary protection in EU countries, without having to apply for asylum, with rights to a residence permit and access to education, housing, and the labour market., The EU is also proposing to simplify border controls and entry conditions for people fleeing Ukraine.[12] Ukrainian refugees can travel for 90 days visa-free throughout EU countries, and many have been moving on from neighbouring countries to join family and friends in other EU countries.[13] Throughout Europe, the public and politicians are mobilizing to show solidarity and support for those fleeing Ukraine, This is how the international refugee protection regime should work, especially in times of crisis: countries keep their borders open to those fleeing wars and conflict; unnecessary identity and security checks are avoided; those fleeing warfare are not penalized for arriving without valid identity and travel documents; detention measures are not used; refugees are able to freely join family members in other countries; communities and their leaders welcome refugees with generosity and solidarity., But we know that this is not how the international protection regime has operated in Europe, particularly in those same countries that are now welcoming refugees from Ukraine. Public discourse in Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania is often tainted by racist and xenophobic rhetoric about refugees and migrants, in particular those from Middle Eastern and African countries, and they have adopted hostile policies like border push-backs and draconian detention measures., A case in point is Hungary: The country has refused to admit refugees from non-EU countries since the 2015 ""refugee crisis.""[14] Prime Minister Victor Orbán has described non-European refugees as ""Muslim invaders"" and migrants as ""a poison,""[15] claiming that Hungary should not accept refugees from different cultures and religions to ""preserve its cultural and ethnic homogeneity.""[16] In May 2020, The European Court of Justice found that Hungary's arbitrary detention of asylum seekers in transit zones on its border with Serbia was illegal.[17], Hungary was not alone in its harsh response to the 2015 ""crisis."" In their book Immigration Detention in the European Union: In the Shadow of the ""Crisis"" (Springer 2020), Global Detention Project (GDP) researchers detailed the evolution of the detention systems of all EU Members States before, during, and after the 2015 refugee crisis. Among their key findings: During the years leading up to 2015, migration-related detention had largely plateaued across the EU, but refugee pressures spurred important increases in detention regimes across the entire region, which remained in place long after the ""crisis"" had subsided. Fuelling these increases was anti-migrant rhetoric that spread from Brussels across the entire continent, abetted by EU-wide migration directives that allowed for lengthy detention periods. Then-European Council President Donald Tusk argued at that time that all arriving refugees should be detained for up to 18 months, in line with the limits in EU directives, while their claims were processed.[18], More recently, in late 2021, the terrible treatment of migrants and asylum seekers, most of them from Iraq and Afghanistan, trapped on Belarus's borders with Poland and Lithuania sparked outrage across Europe. Belarus was accused of weaponizing the plight of these people, luring them to Belarus in order to travel on to EU countries as retaliation against EU sanctions., Polish border guards were brutal in their treatment of these refugees and migrants, many of whom sustained serious injuries from Polish and Belarussian border guards. Thousands were left stranded in the forests between the two countries in deplorable conditions with no food, shelter, blankets, or medicines: at least 19 migrants died in the freezing winter temperatures. In response to this situation, Poland sent soldiers to its border, erected razor-wire fencing, and started the construction of a 186-kilometre wall to prevent asylum seekers entering from Belarus. It also adopted legislation that would allow it to expel anyone who irregularly crossed its border and banned their re-entry. Even before the stand-off between Poland and Belarus, refugees in Poland did not receive a warm welcome. Very few asylum seekers were granted refugee status (in 2020 out of 2,803 applications, only 161 were granted refugee status) and large numbers of refugees and migrants were detained: a total of 1,675 migrants and asylum seekers were in detention in January 2022, compared to just 122 people during all of 2020., With this recent history as backdrop, the double standards and racism inherent in Europe's refugee responses are glaring. There are no calls from Brussels today to detain refugees fleeing Ukraine for up to 18 months. Why? Because, as Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said recently about people from Ukraine: ""These are not the refugees we are used to. ... These people are Europeans. ... These people are intelligent, they are educated people. ... This is not the refugee wave we have been used to, people we were not sure about their identity, people with unclear pasts, who could have been even terrorists.""[19], Similarly, Hungary's Orban has said that every refugee coming from Ukraine will be ""welcomed by friends in Hungary,"" adding that one doesn't have to be a ""rocket scientist"" to see the difference between ""masses arriving from Muslim regions in hope of a better life in Europe"" and helping Ukrainian refugees who have come to Hungary because of the war.[20], Sadly, these double standards have reared in the response to non-Ukrainians fleeing the war in Ukraine. There are a growing number of accounts of students and migrants from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia who have faced racist treatment, obstruction, and violence trying to flee Ukraine. Many described being prevented from boarding trains and buses in Ukrainian towns while priority was given to Ukrainian nationals; others described being aggressively pulled aside and stopped by Ukrainian border guards when trying to cross into neighbouring countries.[21] There are also accounts of Polish authorities taking aside African students and refusing them entry into Poland, although the Polish Ambassador to the UN told a General Assembly meeting on 28 February that assertions of race or religion-based discrimination at Poland's border were ""a complete lie and a terrible insult to us."" He asserted that ""nationals of all countries who suffered from Russian aggression or whose life is at risk can seek shelter in my country."" According to the Ambassador, people from 125 different nationalities have been admitted into Poland from Ukraine.[22], Several African leaders---including, notably, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari---have strongly criticized the discrimination on the borders of Ukraine, saying everyone has the same right to cross international borders to flee conflict and seek safety.[23] The African Union stated that ""reports that Africans are singled out for unacceptable dissimilar treatment would be shockingly racist and in breach of international law,"" and called for all countries to ""show the same empathy and support to all people fleeing war notwithstanding their racial identity.""[24] Similar messages were shared by the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, who said in a Tweet: ""I am grateful for the compassion, generosity and solidarity of Ukraine's neighbours who are taking in those seeking safety. It is important that this solidarity is extended without any discrimination based on race, religion or ethnicity,""[25] and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees who stressed that ""it is crucial that receiving countries continue to welcome all those fleeing conflict and insecurity---irrespective of nationality and race.""[26], The Ukraine refugee crisis presents Europe with not only an important opportunity to demonstrate its generosity, humanitarian values, and commitment to the global refugee protection regime; it is also a critical moment of reflection: Can the peoples of Europe overcome their widespread racism and animosity and embrace the universalist spirit of the 1951 Refugee Convention? As Article 3 of the Convention holds, all member states ""shall apply the provisions of this Convention to refugees without discrimination as to race, religion or country of origin.""[27], [1] Forbes, ""Looming Ukrainian Refugee Crisis Presents Challenge Not Seen Since World War II,"" Andy J.

IOM’s plan is in line with the interagency Flash Appeal for Ukraine and the Regional Refugee Response Plan, which were both launched on 1 March 2022., IOM is requesting USD 250 million for an initial period of three months to meet the needs of over 3.5 million affected people in Ukraine. Intervention areas include: water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), shelter/non-food items (NFI), health (including mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS)), cash-based interventions, food security and livelihoods, protection, humanitarian border management (HBM), camp coordination and camp management (CCCM), the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), and logistics. IOM has also created a separate Flash Appeal for Ukraine based on its inputs into the inter-agency appeal., At the same time, IOM has requested USD 100 million over the course of six months to meet the needs of IDPs, refugees, third country nationals and other migrants, as well as hosting communities in countries neighboring Ukraine, including Belarus, Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Intervention areas include: WASH, shelter-NFI, health (including MHPSS), multi-purpose cash assistance (MCA), livelihoods (including integration support), protection (including humanitarian transport and border management), CCCM, and information management., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Following weeks of heightened tensions in Eastern Ukraine, the Government of Ukraine declared an initial 30-day State of Emergency on 23 February, with the exception of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, where a special security regime has been in place since 2014. Following this declaration, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a military operation in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region on 24 February. Major attacks have been reported across Ukraine, including in the capital, Kyiv. Russian troops have quickly expanded their presence across Ukraine, with military clashes ongoing in other major cities: Chernihiv (north), Kharkiv (north-east), Kherson (south), Mariupol (south-east), Mykolaiv (south), Odessa (south--west), Sumy (north), among other cities, while the pre-existing hostilities in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts have significantly intensified., After intense clashes across Ukraine, the number of civilian causalities and damage to critical infrastructure are growing, triggering severe humanitarian consequences on people in the hardest-hit areas. Between 24 and 28 February, the OHCHR recorded 536 civilian casualties, including 136 people killed; these figures are likely to be considerably higher (source: OHCHR)., The increasing intensity of the conflict has contributed to growing internal displacement and cross-border movement. Over 900,000 persons have crossed into neighbouring countries, with still more projected to come., The current situation is exacerbating an already dire humanitarian emergency in the Donbas region and generating new multisectoral needs across the country. The ongoing hostilities also continue to disrupt local supply chains and access to food and other basic items. In eastern Ukraine, there are reports of food shortages in Kramatorsk (Donetsk oblast) as supplies were mostly coming from Kharkiv. Even before 23 February, the escalating tensions in Donetsk oblast had already damaged roads and bridges that subsequently limited access to markets for food on the government-controlled side of the contact line for those residing in non-government-controlled areas. Food insecurity and medical needs are projected to rise considerably as more people are displaced., Despite the growing operational and security challenges, IOM and other humanitarian organizations remain committed to staying on the ground and responding to growing humanitarian needs and protection risks. UN agencies and humanitarian partners are preparing to scale-up operations for whenever access and security allow for humanitarian operations to be rolled out in the hardest-hit areas.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-1-2-march-2022
"Human Rights Council Hears from 19 Dignitaries as it Continues its High-Level Segment, with Many Statements Focusing on Russia’s Attack on Ukraine and the COVID-19 Pandemic",News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",2 Mar 2022,"2 March 2022
Afternoon, The Human Rights Council this afternoon continued its high-level segment, hearing from 19 dignitaries who spoke about Russia’s attack on Ukraine, human rights, and the COVID-19 pandemic, among other issues., Many speakers condemned the military aggression of the Kremlin against Ukraine, calling on Russia to immediately stop all hostilities, withdraw its military from Ukraine, and fully respect international norms and principles in doing so. Russia's aggression must stop immediately and those responsible for it must be held accountable. The upcoming urgent debate on Ukraine was welcomed. The priority was to prevent further escalation of the conflict. An independent international commission of inquiry must be established in order to investigate all violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law. Russia's actions would have devastating consequences on the humanitarian situation in the region., Emine Dzhaparova, First Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, said Russia’s attack against Ukraine had been made on the direct order of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, who, a few days before that, had shared a list of false claims and accused Ukraine of having committed a genocide. This showed that Vladimir Putin and the Russian leadership existed in an absolute parallel reality., Thousands of homes had been damaged or destroyed or left without electricity; 352 people, including 16 children had died, the youngest being 18 months old; and thousands had been wounded. As the President of Ukraine had said, Russia must be considered a terrorist State., The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was also highlighted by many of the speakers, who highlighted that equitable access to health care and vaccines was a global imperative. The road to recovery must include the elimination of discriminations and special attention should be given to safeguarding the rights of minorities, and other vulnerable groups. Many speakers also noted that human rights should be at the core of every day political action and special attention should be given to the rights of women and children. It was also widely agreed that nations should strive for a united position and for the right of each and every person to enjoy human rights to the fullest extent possible., Speaking were Abdoulaye Diop, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Mali; Bujar Osmani, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Macedonia; Ziyambi Ziyambi, Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs of Zimbabwe; Abdisaid M. Ali, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Somalia; Edgars Rinkēvičs, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Latvia; Gedion Thimothewos Hessebon, Minister of Justice of Ethiopia; Odongo Jeje Abubakhar, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uganda; Albrecht Freiherr von Böselager, Grand Chancellor and Foreign Minister of the Sovereign Order of Malta; Antonio García, State Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Honduras; Péter Szijjártó, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary; Akmal Saidov, Minister for Human Rights of Uzbekistan; Emine Dzhaparova, First Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine; Megi Fino, Deputy Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of Albania; Adv. Lekhetho Rakuoane, Minister of Law and Justice of Lesotho;Rogelio Mayta Mayta, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bolivia; Ingrid Ingrid Brocková, State Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of Slovakia; Patricia Scotland, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth; Julissa Mantilla Falcón, Commissioner and President of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States; Achim Steiner, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme; and Gillian Triggs, Assistant High Commissioner for Protection with the United Nations Refugee Agency., The webcast of the Human Rights Council meetings can be found here. All meeting summaries can be found here. Documents and reports related to the Human Rights Council’s forty-ninth regular session can be found here., The Council will resume its work at 10 a.m. on Thursday, 3 March to conclude its high-level segment, hold its general segment, and then start its urgent debate on the situation of human rights in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression., Statements, ABDOULAYE DIOP, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Mali, reaffirmed Mali’s unwavering commitment to democracy, the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, good governance, women’s empowerment and the respect of rights and freedoms of all. This was the commitment of Mali’s century-long dedication to humanism, respect for human dignity, and uncompromising rejection of injustice. The ratification of almost all human rights instruments was evidence of this. The lesson learnt by Mali was that all should remember that these values could not be taken for granted; they were a permanent endeavour and required that all should be done to help Mali recover from the crisis, the causes of which were not only due to Mali. However, the primary responsibility for this rested on Mali, which struggled to play the role it should, to protect people and their goods within the territory., The international community needed to support Mali, whose path was peppered with crises, which had shaken the State to its very foundations. Mali was working to minimise its impact and reign it in fully, as it was convinced that human rights were inextricably linked to the insecurity, which was the main cause of human rights violations. The security of the country against various barbaric attacks by terrorists and other evil groups on civilians was vital, and securing the territory was a national priority. The Government had stepped up its efforts to recruit, train and equip its security and armed forces, with a view to expanding their operational capacities, which had contributed towards tilting the balance on the ground and improving the situation in the country, including that of human rights. The Special Representative on Mali had contributed towards this. Mali would continue to support him in the proper execution of his mandate. The principles of universality, objectivity and the non-selectivity of human rights, and the principles for the respect of the right of each State to make its political choices and pursue freedom sat uneasily with the economic sanctions placed on Mali, which impeded it from enjoying its human rights., BUJAR OSMANI, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Macedonia, strongly renounced and condemned the military aggression of the Kremlin against Ukraine. North Macedonia called on Russia to immediately stop all hostilities, withdraw its military from Ukraine, and fully respect international norms and principles in doing so. Humanity could not accept a war in the twenty-first century. Human rights should be at the core of interest and in particular care of any society. Everyday political actions would be judged in regard to the level of protection and promotion of the basic human rights as a universal value; and particularly of the most vulnerable groups, including minorities of all kinds. Special attention should be focused on the rights of women and children. North Macedonia strongly supported the work of the Human Rights Council and this was why it had presented its candidature for membership of this Council for the period 2025-2027., Many challenges threatened peace, security and human rights in the world today. As if the existing threats on peace and security were not sufficient, the current COVID-19 pandemic with its devastating socio-economic consequences, had further increased the existing economic inequality, blindly manifested in the unequal access to vaccines globally. There was a fine line between the measures adopted to fight the pandemic and the restrictions of the fundamental human rights and freedoms. Being extremely vigilant not to cross this line, North Macedonia took all necessary measures to protect human health by providing regular vaccination for all age groups. On climate change and its impact on biodiversity, North Macedonia demonstrated its willingness to energetically act in this regard by promoting a green agenda at the national level, in order to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2050, in line with the European Union Green Deal. North Macedonia would chair the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 2023 and in this capacity, it would continue to promote the human rights which were the birthright of all human beings., ZIYAMBI ZIYAMBI, Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs of Zimbabwe, said the Government of Zimbabwe was committed to the Human Rights Council and the ongoing efforts to enjoy human rights for its people. Zimbabwe was determined to bring land reform to the country. Some 900 former farmers had been allocated land under various government initiatives and the Government continued to find funding for farmers who needed to resettle. An agreement was reached in 2021 with almost 4,000 individuals. Zimbabwe had been hard hit by the pandemic. In addition to the pandemic, climate change, drought and food insecurity had severely impacted the country. Budgetary resources had been redistributed to help alleviate the suffering of the people in Zimbabwe. In addition, a review of all social security benefits was also underway., The national vaccination programme was launched in March 2021 and had reached many; close to 40 per cent of the population was fully vaccinated, with a booster programme underway. In order to enhance the participation of women in politics, the constitution provided for a 30 per cent quota for women in local authority governments. On electoral reforms, Zimbabwe was actively engaged in widespread consultation with political parties and civil society organizations to come up with an electoral amendment bill. The issue of reforming and improving election processes was being addressed. Illegal sanctions imposed by some on Zimbabwe had had a negative impact. Zimbabwe looked forward to the findings of a special report on the negative impact of these sanctions on the enjoyment of human rights in Zimbabwe., ABDISAID M. ALI, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Somalia, said as a nation that had been recovering from conflict, Somalia was in a unique position to share its experience on human rights in a challenging environment; as part of the Human Rights Council, it could contribute greatly. Somalia had had African Union peace-keeping operations in the country for the last 15 years, where they had been instrumental in delivering peace and security. Somalia today was in a position to assume full responsibility for this security by 2023. The threat of Al-Shabaab today was different from that over the last 10 years; the threat had transcended borders and was transnational in nature, with sophisticated technologies and broader capabilities, including foreign fighters, improvised explosive devices, and access to drones. There was now consensus that the new African Union Mission would address the current threat, supporting the goals and objectives of the Somalian Transition Plan., Piracy no longer posed a significant threat to regional and global peace, and the current resolution no longer had a role to play in that regard. The Federal Government of Somalia was trying to address the current threats, including illegal and unreported fishing, toxic waste dumping, and trafficking, including in human beings and charcoal. The suspected Somali pirates whose human rights had been violated were in most cases arrested or taken to foreign countries where they were denied due process and imprisoned for years. The international community had allowed certain actions in this regard, in order to counter piracy threats. Human rights were universal, and that meant they must be enjoyed by all, without discrimination. The Government of Somalia was committed to the Council’s Universal Periodic Review mechanism., EDGARS RINKEVICS, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Latvia, condemned in the strongest possible way the unlawful, large-scale aggression against Ukraine as well as the involvement of Belarus in the attack on Ukraine and expressed his condolences to Ukrainian families. Russia's aggression must stop immediately and those responsible for it must be held accountable. All available means to this effect must be explored, including international courts and tribunals. It was also essential that the Human Rights Council was able to react immediately and effectively and use all available tools to do so., Latvia welcomed the urgent debate on Ukraine. An independent international commission of inquiry must be established in order to investigate all violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law. Russia's actions would have devastating consequences on the humanitarian situation in the region. The conflict in eastern Ukraine, and the illegal annexation of Crimea had already caused wide-spread human rights violations. Now the lives of millions in Ukraine had been put at risk by President Putin’s military action. Russia continued to suppress its own nationals and had detained thousands of anti-war protesters in Russia. The United Nations system must be ready to address all these challenges and help people in need. The priority must be to prevent further escalation of the conflict, civilian casualties, displacement and destruction of civilian infrastructure., GEDION THIMOTHEWOS HESSEBON, Minister of Justice of Ethiopia, said this session of the Council was meeting at a time when the world was grappling with numerous human rights challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, political instability and tensions, and an alarming rise in unconstitutional changes of government that were undermining human rights, in particular in the African continent. Ethiopia was one of the countries that had been affected significantly by these challenges. The attempts of a militant and rogue political organization to bring about an unconstitutional change of government through the use of force had resulted in a tragic conflict with disastrous consequences for the most vulnerable. This group had sent its troops and proxies on a rampage of wanton violence against civilians, looting schools and hospitals. The campaign of terrorising civilians in the Afar and Amhara regions had been carried out through the commission of various atrocities. The Government had managed to reverse the territorial gains made by this terrorist group. As part of an effort to avoid further bloodshed, the Government had put a halt to the advancement of its own troops., Ethiopia had put in place an institutional and legal framework to erase the underlying political problems that gave rise to conflict through a process of inclusive national dialogue and deliberations. Ethiopia was trying to put an end to hostilities, ensure accountability and enhance the protection and promotion of human rights in very challenging circumstances. As they spoke right now, the rebel group was engaged in acts of violence in the Afar region, resulting in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians. Ethiopia had cooperated with the joint investigation team deployed by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission to investigate serious human rights allegations in the context of the conflict. Ethiopia was ready to engage with human rights mechanisms that were focused on the genuine promotion and protection of human rights. Ethiopia was committed to finding ways to work with all partners and mechanisms that respected its sovereignty., ODONGO JEJE ABUBAKHAR, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uganda, said Uganda’s continued cooperation with the Human Rights Council’s special mechanisms was evidence of its confirmed commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. It had submitted reports to the treaty bodies voluntarily. Its engagement with the Universal Periodic Review had been constructive. It was the spirit of constructive engagement that should permeate all the other mechanisms and organizations of the Human Rights Council. The theme of this year’s panel discussion on human rights mainstreaming was timely. The Voluntary Fund had helped with the participation in the work of the Council, as well as capacity building. During this session, pursuant to resolution 46/10, Uganda looked forward to the report of the Secretary-General on the realisation of all countries of economic, social and cultural rights and the impact of public policies put in place to combat COVID-19., Implementing the United Nations “protect, respect and remedy” framework guaranteed labour and land rights. This year had started with hope for better health for all around the world. Uganda had had success in limiting transmission and fatalities due to COVID-19. The support of international partners, including with vaccines, was appreciated. The lack of access to vaccines had been a good lesson for Africa, as it taught it of the need to build local capacity, including logistics. Uganda was progressing well in the search for a vaccine and welcomed collaboration from other countries in this regard. Uganda was also focused on economic recovery by supporting small enterprises and increasing household incomes. All should remain realistic about how to assess progress made in the realisation of economic and social rights., ALBRECHT FREIHERR VON BOSELAGER, Grand Chancellor and Foreign Minister of the Sovereign Order of Malta, said that he was witnessing with great emotions the ongoing conflict in Ukraine which was currently causing an outbreak of displaced persons. In regard to the dramatic events in Ukraine and the many armed conflicts in the world, the Human Rights Council was the only international body tackling all issues related to human rights violations. He was confident that the work of the Council could help alleviate the suffering of many. The Sovereign Order of Malta remained strong in its commitment to uphold the rights of the most vulnerable, as the lives of many had been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The road for recovery must include the elimination of discriminations and special attention should be given to safeguarding the rights of minorities, and other vulnerable groups., The Sovereign Order of Malta was fully engaged in various fora to protect freedoms of belief and thought and conscience, among many others, as it recognised the value of inter-religious dialogue to facilitate worldwide humanitarian action. The tragic events in Ukraine were highlighting the links between religion and diplomacy, and the necessity of negotiation rather than the use of force. At the end of 2018, 82.4 million people had been forcibly displaced due to conflicts and other disturbances of public order. Governments were responsible for protecting vulnerable people, particularly refugees and migrants who had the right to live in dignity, peace and safety. The Grand Chancellor of the Sovereign Order of Malta called on all Member States to ensure safe migration roads., ANTONIO GARCÍA, State Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Honduras, said Honduras was working towards a new and helpful vision to promote various issues, including the non-discrimination of women, and the protection of the elderly and persons with disabilities. Moreover, it was working towards protecting human rights defenders and the vulnerable. Honduras had designed and implemented its first public policy on human rights and under a new government was working with the newly established human rights office. Honduras was experiencing internal displacement first-hand and was working to address the needs of the displaced people. It had also designed and implemented emergency assistance for returnees in need of protection and was helping them to integrate into the job market., Honduras had also created a mechanism of protection for human rights defenders and journalists, designed to help them. Journalists had also shared their experiences so that a perspective of what it was like on the ground could be given to help promote policies in tune with what was happening. Honduras recognised the work of the Human Rights Council and thanked Member States for their support to enable Honduras to build capacity to help protect human rights. Honduras was committed to working with the Council to achieve further results, to recognise human rights violations, and to strengthen human rights on a global level., PÉTER SZIJJÁRTÓ, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, said Hungary had been facing security risks over the last few days. Its neighbour Ukraine was suffering from a war, which they did not want, nor did Hungary want it. Hungary wanted peace as soon as possible. It stood by Ukraine with regard to its territorial integrity and sovereignty. Hungary hoped and prayed for the success of the peace talks and had offered its capital or any other location as a safe location for these to occur. Both the Ukrainian and the Russian Governments had been informed of this offer. Hungary hoped the second round of talks would come soon, and that they would continue, as this was the only way to make peace again as soon as possible. The Government had made all the necessary measures to protect Hungary and the Hungarian people, deploying troops to the eastern border in order to prevent any paramilitary or military groups from entering, and had made all necessary decisions to avoid Hungary being involved in the war. It did not allow the delivery of lethal weapons to transit through Hungary as they could become the target of hostile military actions, which would put in danger the lives of Hungarians whether in Hungary or in the Trans-Carpathian region in Ukraine., The most fundamental human right was the right to live life under safe and peaceful circumstances, and the right of the Ukrainian people in this regard was being violated massively. During the last less-than-one-week, Hungary had already accepted more than 100,000 refugees. All border crossings were open and fully operational. All could come in, both citizens and legal inhabitants of Ukraine, and they were being provided with food and accommodation. Hungary had even passed a regulation allowing citizens of third countries, be they students or workers with a job in Ukraine, to enter Hungary without a visa, and had organised transfers for them to the nearest airports so that they could return home. Hungary did not allow any illegal migrants to enter the territory. Hungary was carrying out the most robust humanitarian aid of its history., AKMAL SAIDOV, Minister for Human Rights of Uzbekistan, said Uzbekistan supported the call for action to human rights, which were central to the ongoing reforms in social, legal and socio-economic situations in the country. Uzbekistan did so in full comprehension of the United Nations principle to leave nobody behind. A resolution should be adopted to ensure that Parliaments could support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and attaining human rights. Uzbekistan had worked to reduce the number of stateless people, granting more than 70,000 inhabitants of the country Uzbek nationality. Uzbekistan took a balanced and neutral position with regard to the ongoing conflict, with traditionally close relationships with both Russia and Ukraine, and was interested in maintaining peace in the region. All disagreements should be dealt with in the framework of the norms of international law. Uzbekistan was taking steps to ensure the development of civil society organizations. A new law on religious organizations had been adopted. A plan for gender equality had been approved. Civil society institutions actively participated in the national human rights strategy. Steps were being taken to strengthen the position of the business community in the area of human rights., Uzbekistan intended to continue to educate on the establishment of an Asian human rights mechanism; it had made significant progress in its collaboration with the United Nations human rights institutions in the regard. All should support the Uzbek initiative to create a global environmental charter that would create a new United Nations environmental perspective, post-pandemic. Uzbekistan was committed to dialoguing with all, including the United Nations and its institutions., EMINE DZHAPAROVA, First Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, said that seven days ago, Ukraine had woken up to a new reality: in the middle of Europe, in the twenty-first century, at 4 o'clock on 24 February, Russian armed forces, supported by Belarus, had attacked Ukraine with all their strength. She had woken up early in the morning due to the sound of an explosion and had seen fire, far away from the place where she had stayed that night, and had understood that the war had started. The attack had been made on the direct order of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, who, a few days before that, had shared a list of false claims and accused Ukraine of having committed a genocide. This showed that Vladimir Putin and the Russian leadership existed in an absolute parallel reality., Thousands of homes had been damaged or destroyed and left without electricity; 352 people, including 16 children had died, the youngest being 18 months old; and thousands had been wounded. As they spoke today, Russian armed forces were continuing to attack maternity wards, orphanages and hospitals. As the President of Ukraine had said, Russia must be considered a terrorist State. Russian attacks were not only targeting Ukrainians but also foreigners staying in Ukraine. Ukraine understood the will of foreign citizens to leave the territory of Ukraine and was committed to provide as much assistance as possible. It wished to remind that there was no discrimination based on race when it came to crossing the border for foreign citizens. Russia must be accountable for its manipulation of the very notion of genocide to justify its aggression and the war., Tomorrow, the Human Rights Council would hold an urgent debate on the situation of human rights in Ukraine stemming from the aggression of Russia. It was crucial to have mechanisms to hold those violating human rights accountable, Ms. Dzhaparova said. She had been asked many times what was the mood in Ukraine lately. Ukraine was under attack, but this was not the time to cry tears. Ukraine would cry for sure when they were victorious and their eyes would be full of tears of happiness when they started to rebuild the cities that were being destroyed. The Government was fully operational and on behalf of the Ukrainian Government she said: ""we don’t need a ride, we need your help""., MEGI FINO, Deputy Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of Albania, said despite all diplomatic efforts, Russia was blatantly invading a sovereign country in serious violation of law and order. Albania strongly condemned the unlawful attack on Ukraine. For the psychological damage caused to millions of Ukrainians, including children, Albania said there was no way to be silent and the perpetrators of the war must be condemned. Albania reiterated the need for the full respect of humanitarian law. This year was the first year that Albania was a member of the United Nations Security Council and it valued its participation there. Human rights were among Albania’s priorities, as well as the promotion and protection of human rights, as they were crucial to sustainable development and lasting peace. This made the work of the human rights system in Geneva vital., The COVID-19 pandemic had exposed deep inequalities and had affected vulnerable groups, whether based on gender, political identity or age, amplifying hate and discrimination. Albania stood ready to join forces with all countries to stand up and protect human rights. The advancement of gender equality and the rights of women and girls was one of Albania’s first priorities and it was committed to protecting women activists and human rights defenders. Albania would also engage with Council initiatives for those who were vulnerable and risked falling further behind, including persons with disabilities. Albania was aware of the turbulent situations in different parts of the world impacting different groups., LEKHETHO RAKUOANE, Minister of Law and Justice of Lesotho, said the session had placed an important introspection on the meaning of the universality of human rights. Lesotho held the Human Rights Council in high esteem, and it was doing commendable work in the protection and promotion of human rights worldwide. However, it still had a lot of work to do, given the history of exploitation around the world and the road the concept of human rights still had to travel. There was need for strong political will from States and for United Nations efforts to fulfil the reason for which the Human Rights Council had been established. The reporting process was an important tool to evaluate the domestic implementation of treaties. Lesotho had participated in the Universal Periodic Review mechanism in 2020, and an Action Plan was drafted in 2021 to fulfil its recommendations; Lesotho had applied to the Voluntary Fund for funding to help with this implementation. The Government had submitted its list of issues prior to reporting to the Human Rights Committee under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and was preparing to fulfil its treaty obligations., The rights of persons with disabilities were being mainstreamed in Lesotho, with inclusive education, and a Disability Public Fund was being established. Food insecurity and high prevalence of HIV/AIDS were stumbling blocks to the enjoyment of human rights in Lesotho, along with the prevailing menace of the times - the COVID-19 pandemic. Drastic measures had to be taken to contain the spread of the pandemic, which impacted the enjoyment of human rights for certain communities. The lesson learnt by the international community so far was that human rights violations affected all human rights, and the approach to the pandemic must be done in a spirit of inclusivity. As Lesotho worked to guarantee its citizens the full spectrum of rights, human rights could not be overlooked. As it struggled to maintain the Sustainable Development Goals, all should ensure that human rights were at their heart., ROGELIO MAYTA MAYTA, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bolivia, said Bolivia intended to contribute to upholding the existence of indigenous languages and knowledge, and their connection with the earth. It had created an institute to fulfil this goal. The international community could not continue to treat its ancestral home as it had done in the past: climate change and pollution were threatening the lives of most humans, with fires and floods; the most vulnerable were losing their lives. More and more were on the move because of climate change. Climate migrations were causing loss of life. Nothing overcame the escalation of war and the severe events that could be a threat to human beings’ existence as a species. All shared a planet, and all were affected., Any war killed the innocent and was a breakage in the right to life. In a war, civilization was lost. The conflict in Ukraine could not be a solution to anything. The deaths and destruction had many perpetrators, all parties involved, who instead of talking were causing more death and more human rights violations. The war in Ukraine was a tragedy and could not be ignored. There needed to be dialogue and diplomacy. Bolivia had suffered many wars of aggression and had lost more than half its territory, and despite this bitter experience it had chosen peace and was a pacifist State. The Council, based on the powerful idea of respecting life as a fundamental human right, needed to call on those involved to put down their arms and give diplomacy, dialogue and life a chance., INGRID BROCKOVA, State Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of Slovakia, condemned in the strongest possible terms the ongoing aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Unjustified and unprovoked military operations by Russia were a manifest violation of international law. Slovakia fully supported and recognised the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Slovakia strongly called for the immediate release of all detained people in Russia for participating in protests against Russia's military operation in Ukraine. The State Secretary expressed her deep concern about the increasingly deteriorating human rights situation in Belarus with more than 1,000 political prisoners, and more than 260 non-governmental organizations closed, and independent media wiped out., According to the 2020 Manifesto of the Government of Slovakia, the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the promotion of the rule of law, were key criteria in advocating the foreign policy interests of the country. The Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs had appointed the first ever Slovak Ambassador for Human Rights. The creation of this position underlined Slovakia’s deeper commitment to protecting and promoting human rights. However, the year 2021 was also a year of self-reflection to rectify the wrongdoings of the past. The Government had issued an apology for victims of sterilisation of women carried out not fully in accordance with the law between 1966 and 1989, and also for some practices which continued between 1990 and 2004, affecting mostly Roma women. Slovakia had decided to provide a special contribution of 100,000 euros to the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, a contribution primarily focused on the protection of civilians in armed conflict., PATRICIA SCOTLAND, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, said human rights were enshrined in the charter of the Commonwealth, both as a central obligation, and as a cornerstone of its wider commitment to peace, democracy and championing the most vulnerable. The Commonwealth’s devotion to human rights was more than an abstract pledge. Human rights put people front and centre. The pandemic had been previously described by the Commonwealth as a human rights emergency. This had been borne out directly in the threat to life, health and livelihoods. It had also been borne out more broadly in the exacerbation of existing vulnerabilities and inequalities and in new forms of exclusion; and in the intensification of exposure to harm or violence, especially amongst women, girls and marginalised groups. The reality was that every kind of global emergency was a human rights emergency. It followed that human rights must be at the heart both of the international community’s immediate response and at the heart of the long-term efforts to build back better, stronger, fairer and more resilient., For the pandemic, that meant urgent action to ensure equitable access to vaccines across the world, as the fastest way out of the acute phase of the crisis. It also meant long-term support for all nations to build strong, resilient, high quality health services to which everyone had access. This focus was at the heart of the Memorandum of Understanding signed last month between the Commonwealth Secretariat and the World Health Organization. Strengthening the whole enabled every nation, every community, in every part of our world, to be more peaceful, more secure, happier, healthier and more prosperous, with the pandemic reminding everyone of how important – and how fragile – security, health and prosperity could be., JULISSA MANTILLA FALCÓN, Commissioner and President of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States, said the COVID-19 pandemic had a severe and ongoing impact on human rights throughout the world. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights had monitored the situation and made its reports available. Persistent discrimination against women, and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons, children and adolescents and social leaders had taken place. Severe humanitarian crises had added to the more than 84 million displaced around the world. Anti-democratic endeavours persisted in societies., Concerning Cuba, there were several violations with regard to the institution of representative democracy, with negative impact on human rights and with the right to free expression circumscribed. In Nicaragua, there was a new state of repression in the country, putting an end to general participation in elections. The climate of oppression showed how the Government aimed to keep itself permanently in power in a situation of structural impunity. The situation in Venezuela was also of concern, with the absence of the rule of law, the lack of independence of the different branches of the government, and the concentration of power in the executive branch. The situation in Bolivia was also of concern and needed to be remedied. It was important to continue to strengthen the democratic institutions in the Americas as a whole., ACHIM STEINER, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, said that COVID 19 was not an equal opportunity bearer as shown with the unequal access to the vaccine. Boosters after boosters were given in some countries while millions of people in developing countries were unprotected. Ensuring vaccine equity was crucial to protecting all humans. Mr. Steiner condemned every act of violence against human rights defenders, stating that when governments suppressed dissenting voices, this led to conflicts and turmoil. Countries must find a way to end the acts of intimidation, violence and murder and must do more to applaud the vital contribution that human rights defenders made to the world. On climate change, Mr. Steiner said it was the single biggest threat to human rights today. Having a clean and healthy environment was indeed a human right, and there was a need to respect that human right of the next generation., It was crucial to amend the digital gap so that everyone could have their say on climate change. At the United Nations Development Programme, they were leveraging human rights as a problem-solving tool. Human rights mechanisms provided the world with guidance as to how to protect and promote human rights, yet there was a gap between the world of human rights and the reality on the ground. Ninety per cent of the Sustainable Development Goals were linked to human rights yet they often remained an afterthought. Guided by the Programme’s ambitious new strategic plan, they were proud to play their part within the United Nations family and would continue to work with countries and integrate human rights in their advocacy., GILLIAN TRIGGS, Assistant High Commissioner for Protection with the United Nations Refugee Agency, welcomed the opportunity to highlight the specific protection needs of asylum seekers and refugees and of all those forcibly displaced in their own country or who were stateless. People who had been forcibly displaced - today about 84 million people, 50 per cent of them children - were highly vulnerable to persecution, discrimination, abuse and violence. They were in desperate need of the protection that international, regional, and national human rights laws and mechanisms could and did offer. The COVID-19 pandemic had taught many lessons. It was crystal clear now that equitable access to health care was a global imperative; that a pandemic did not respect the legal status of citizenship or nationality; and that asylum seekers and those who were stateless must be included. As the world recovered from the immediate health impacts of the virus, they were left with a legacy of long-term socio-economic crises that threatened the recovery of all those forcibly displaced when compared to nationals in the same situation. The resilience and capacity of a displaced person to bounce back was slower, and their access to education, housing and livelihoods would be more restricted., Although many had hoped the pandemic might pave the way for ceasefires and for opportunities for peace, political upheaval and conflict across the globe had shown no signs of abating. Conflicts continued to be unresolved, and political violence, repression, and fault lines had become further entrenched. Deep societal divisions, made worse by poor governance and a lack of respect for the rule of law, had given voice to discrimination, racism, and xenophobia, especially against people who had been forcibly displaced., Link: https://www.ungeneva.org/en/news-media/meeting-summary/2022/03/conseil-des-droits-de-lhomme-la-premiere-vice-ministre-des, ___________, Produced by the United Nations Information Service in Geneva for use of the information media; not an official record.

At least 100,000 people are internally displaced, meaning they have had to flee their homes, but are unable to make the journey to the border, although these figures have not yet been confirmed, In parts of eastern Ukraine, the people fleeing conflict are trying to escape through one of the most mine-contaminated regions in the world, risking death and injury as they flee., Caritas Ukraine emergency response, Caritas Ukraine and its local partner, Caritas Spes, are currently supporting internally displaced people with food, clothing and psychological support. So far, an estimated 2,000 internally displaced people, mostly women and children, have received emergency accommodation, food and medicine., As air raids continue to rain bombs over residential areas, Caritas Ukraine has been setting up refuge shelters with food and medicine.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Mar 2022,"More than 1.6 million people have already fled their homes in Ukraine. An estimated one million people have sought refuge in other parts of the country, and 660,000 more in neighboring countries. People are in urgent need of food, water, shelter, and health services., With no end in sight to the crisis, Action Against Hunger is deeply concerned about the safety of people, public spaces like hospitals and schools, and humanitarian workers who are mobilizing to help. Safe, unrestricted humanitarian access must be guaranteed., Action Against Hunger calls on parties to the conflict to fulfil their obligations under International Humanitarian Law to protect civilians and civilian infrastructures from the direct and indirect impacts of hostilities. We urge parties to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2417, which condemns the use of hunger as a weapon of war., THE LOOMING THREAT OF HUNGER, Conflict drives hunger. Even before this crisis, 1.5 million people in Eastern Ukraine were in need of food security and livelihoods assistance last year– a 51% increase compared to 2020. Instability makes it harder for people to grow food, access and maintain markets, and maintain their livelihoods. As a result, food prices have been increasing., This conflict and food crisis will have implications beyond Ukraine: dozens of countries rely on Ukrainian harvests to feed their people. The Middle East and Africa absorbed nearly 40% of Ukraine’s exports of corn and wheat in 2021. Global food prices, which were already the highest they have been in a decade, could rise and result in increased food insecurity around the world., ACTION AGAINST HUNGER’S RESPONSE, Existing humanitarian organizations in Ukraine will not have the capacity to deal with soaring needs. Action Against Hunger has experience working in Ukraine and, together with our partners and contacts, our emergency teams are assessing the situation and exploring the most effective ways to respond to humanitarian needs. We are also sending exploratory missions to Poland and Moldova to evaluate how we can help meet the needs of refugees., Early reports indicate that the most urgent humanitarian needs are for cash, mental health services, healthcare, and water, sanitation, and hygiene. We urge donors to quickly step up to provide urgent and flexible funding to respond to this rapidly changing situation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/crisis-update-conflict-ukraine
"Atrocity Alert No. 290: Ukraine, Myanmar (Burma) and Nigeria",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,2 Mar 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., ATTACKS ON CIVILIAN INFRASTRUCTURE AS RUSSIA’S INVASION OF UKRAINE CONTINUES, On Thursday, 24 February, forces from the Russian Federation invaded Ukraine and began launching attacks on major cities, including the capital, Kyiv, as well as Kharkiv, Kherson, Mariupol and others. Between 24-28 February the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights verified at least 142 civilian deaths, including 13 children, though the actual death toll is likely much higher. Most casualties were caused by the use of indiscriminate explosive weapons, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple rocket systems. Reports have indicated several attacks on civilian infrastructure, including apartment buildings, homes, schools and hospitals, as well as the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial site. Attacks on these objects and the use of indiscriminate weapons is in violation of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and may amount to war crimes., The conflict has forced over 874,000 people to flee Ukraine to neighboring countries. Some minority populations attempting to flee, including civilians of African, Asian and Middle Eastern descent, have reported being removed from trains, beaten and/or harassed by border authorities. Under the Refugee Convention, the international community has both a moral and legal obligation to assist all refugees, regardless of race, religion or country of origin., Following Russia’s veto of a draft UN Security Council resolution on 25 February, the Council adopted a “Uniting for Peace” resolution, which allows the General Assembly to give recommendations on responses to security crises when the Security Council fails to act “because of a lack of unanimity of the permanent members.” On 2 March, during an emergency special session, the General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning Russia’s use of force in Ukraine and the subsequent violations of IHL and International Human Rights Law. The resolution also called on all parties to protect civilian populations and objects from attack. Additionally, the Human Rights Council will hold an urgent debate on 3 March., Numerous states and regional organizations have responded to the invasion with crippling sanctions and other economic measures. On 28 February the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced his intention to open an investigation. The Court previously found evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity during a preliminary examination of the “Maidan” protests and armed conflict in eastern Ukraine since 2013. Ukraine has also filed a case with the International Court of Justice, asking for the Court’s clarification under Article XI of the Genocide Convention, after the Russian government accused Ukraine of committing a genocide against Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine. The claim has been internationally rebuked as false., Savita Pawnday, Executive Director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “while we welcome the uncharacteristically quick response of the international community, civilians will continue to be at an ever-increasing risk of atrocities until the armed conflict ends. Ensuring Russia halts the invasion is paramount.”, ICJ HEARS MYANMAR’S OBJECTIONS TO ROHINGYA GENOCIDE CASE, On 28 February the International Court of Justice (ICJ) concluded hearings on Myanmar’s (Burma) preliminary objections to The Gambia’s case on the genocide against the Rohingya. In 2019 The Gambia filed suit against Myanmar at the ICJ, accusing Myanmar of violating its obligations under the Genocide Convention. On 23 January 2020 the ICJ issued four provisional measures, ordering the government of Myanmar to take immediate action to protect its “extremely vulnerable” Rohingya population from potential genocidal acts. Myanmar later filed four preliminary objections to the case in January 2021, disputing The Gambia’s standing to file the case and challenging the Court’s jurisdiction., The Gambia v. Myanmar is a historic lawsuit seeking to acknowledge Myanmar’s responsibility as a state for the genocide committed against the Rohingya. Starting in October 2016 and then again in August 2017, Myanmar’s military – the Tatmadaw – engaged in so-called “clearance operations” against the Rohingya, a distinct Muslim ethnic minority, in Rakhine State. The operations were characterized by brutal violence and serious human rights violations that, according to UN investigations, amount to genocide and crimes against humanity. Survivors reported indiscriminate killings, rape and sexual violence, arbitrary detention and torture. The clearance operations followed decades of systematic persecution of the Rohingya by the government., During the hearings, Dawda Jallow, The Gambia’s Minister of Justice, emphasized that, “The Gambia may be a geographically small state, but we stand tall in the international community of States and take pride in promoting and protecting human rights, and international accountability for atrocity crimes like genocide. Justice and accountability for those acts of genocide, and for Myanmar’s ongoing acts of genocide, is not just possible – it is necessary.”, The hearings were the first proceedings in The Gambia v. Myanmar since the February 2021 coup. Myanmar’s military is currently representing the state at the ICJ. The decision on the preliminary objections and whether the case can proceed will be released at an undetermined date. In the meantime, the four provisional measures remain in place., Liam Scott, Research Associate at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, stated that, “the case at the ICJ provides a long-awaited opportunity for victims and survivors. While the provisional measures offer some protection, many of those responsible for the genocide remain in power and there is no indication that they are complying with these measures.” The military continues to perpetrate atrocities against the Rohingya and other populations across Myanmar with impunity., DOZENS OF CIVILIANS KILLED IN A SPATE OF ATTACKS IN NIGERIA, Since Friday, 25 February, the so-called Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) have perpetrated a series of attacks in Borno State, northeast Nigeria. On Friday alleged ISWA fighters killed three civilians and destroyed a church in Kautikeri village, Chibok district, Borno State. This was the second reported attack on the village in a month. ISWA fighters subsequently attacked three villages – Sabongarin Kimba, Mandara-Girau and Ngama – killing at least 24 civilians for allegedly assisting government troops in their search for armed extremists. The villages are reportedly on the periphery of a key extremist hideout., These attacks took place days after the Governor of Borno State, Babagana Zulum, updated President Muhammadu Buhari on the latest security developments, stating that the security situation had improved and thousands of fighters from the armed extremist groups Boko Haram and ISWA have surrendered. Since January, security forces have reportedly killed at least 180 fighters. Sustained land and air raids between 10 and 24 February led to the surrender of 466 fighters. However, ISWA have escalated their attacks in recent weeks, leaving populations at risk., Despite the violence, ISWA and Boko Haram have gained popularity among local communities by providing basic services and security in exchange for controlling trade and imposing taxes. ISWA have also secured trade routes and revived farming and fishing activities., Civilians in central and north-west Nigeria are also facing increased inter-communal violence and attacks by armed bandits. Attempting to combat the combined threat of large-scale banditry and armed extremism, Nigeria’s armed forces have been deployed in two-thirds of the states in the country and are overstretched., Juliette Paauwe, Senior Research Analyst at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “the proliferation of armed extremist groups resulted in part from the government’s reliance on a military strategy, which has failed to address the root causes of conflict in Nigeria. The increase in ISWA attacks amidst the ongoing government offensive is indicative of the need to invest in broader social reforms alongside a military strategy to combat armed extremism.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/atrocity-alert-no-290-ukraine-myanmar-burma-and-nigeria

Russia has laid siege to urban and residential areas with increasing force via ground fighting, heavy artillery and shelling, multi-launch rocket systems, missiles, and airstrikes., According to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 249 civilians, including 17 children, have been killed between February 24 and March 2. An additional 553 civilians, including 30 children, have been injured by the fighting. These numbers are believed to be underestimates as capturing the true extent of fatalities amidst the violence remains challenging due to reporting delays and inability to assess the scope amidst constant fighting., Damage to civilian infrastructure continues, causing disruptions in electrical lines as well as gas and water supply systems. This is even more concerning considering temperatures in Ukraine are frequently below freezing. There are frequent reports of open fire on hospitals and schools in areas on both side of the contact line in Eastern Ukraine.iii",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/conflict-ukraine-situation-report-3-3-march-2022
"One Week In, Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine Shows Alarming Trends in Civilians Harm",News and Press Release,CIVIC,Protection and Human Rights,3 Mar 2022,"“The village is almost destroyed, as it was under heavy shelling since the start, and a Russian flag is now flying in the square. Mobile connection and electricity are almost non-existent. Abandoned houses and administrative buildings that have escaped destruction are now being looted.” – Woman from Tryokhizbenka, Donbas, Over the past week, Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC), like others, has strived to monitor data on incidents of civilian harm from open-source, local, and international media, as well as from local authorities, in order to identify main patterns and trends., Initial reports focused on significant incidental harm resulting from warfighting in densely populated areas. In many urban centers of Ukraine, the entanglement of military objectives with civilian presence and civilian objects – further exacerbated by the use of explosive weapons such as ballistic missiles, multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), and other explosive weapons with wide area effect – have resulted in civilian deaths and injuries, as well as damage to critical infrastructure. The reported use of prohibited weapons, such as banned cluster munitions, also aggravates risks to civilians. Moreover, the presence of unexploded ordnances (UXOs) presents threats to civilians that can last for years to come, as they may unknowingly detonate and the process to remove them is often dangerous., As conflict escalates, we are also observing an increased use by the Russian Federation of tactics designed to create massive casualties. These include indiscriminate attacks on populated areas, as well as possible targeted attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, although verification of information is very complex at the moment., Both indiscriminate and targeted attacks on civilians represent blatant violations of International Humanitarian Law (IHL)., As a result, civilians (including women and children) have been harmed; residential buildings, schools, hospitals, and essential infrastructure destroyed; and oil depots, nuclear waste disposals, and power plants damaged., For many, leaving their home and fleeing within Ukraine to safer areas, or out of Ukraine entirely, has been the only solution, which further exposes them to immense risks. For others, the only solution is/has been to stay and take shelter., One week into the war, the international community needs to support the adoption of urgent measures to protect the lives of civilians in Ukraine., The first absolute priority is to bring about a ceasefire and stop the fighting., Second, evacuation routes need to be urgently negotiated in order to allow civilians to safely flee. Civilians must not be prevented from fleeing, nor be attacked during the process., Third, humanitarian corridors must be established from and into areas exposed to intense fighting, where the dire need of food, medical supplies, winterization items, and other essential non-food items increases the vulnerability of the population day after day., Fourth, in order to bring about full accountability and transparency into alleged International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law (IHRL) violations and abuses, the work of existing monitoring and investigation mechanisms in Ukraine needs to be reinforced and scaled up; in addition, an independent fact-finding mission, for instance under the form of an independent international commission of inquiry, needs to urgently be established to hold perpetrators accountable., In order to fully establish facts and circumstances and to identify perpetrators, disaggregated data will need to be able to track specific incidents attributed to private military contractors., All parties should abide by IHL and IHRL; all parties must take precautionary measures to mitigate harm before, during, and after operations to protect the civilian population of Ukraine., Beatrice Godefroy, CIVIC Europe Director",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/one-week-russia-s-invasion-ukraine-shows-alarming-trends-civilians-harm

Le CICR a engagé avec toutes les parties un dialogue bilatéral confidentiel dont l’objet est de garantir en tout temps la protection de la population civile, mais aussi de préserver l’accès aux services essentiels, les logements et toute l’infrastructure indispensable à la survie., Urgence dans les pays voisins aussi, Les besoins sont également immenses dans les pays voisins, en particulier dans les régions frontalières. Ici aussi, la Croix-Rouge distribue des biens de première nécessité aux réfugiés, arrivés par centaines de milliers, met à leur disposition des hébergements d’urgence et leur propose un soutien psychosocial.

Elle salue le fait que la Suisse se soit montrée ouverte à l’accueil de réfugiés ukrainiens. Ces derniers – indépendamment de leur nationalité – doivent se voir accorder une protection rapidement et sans complications. Il faut veiller ici à ce que l’accueil pragmatique de réfugiés d’Ukraine ne se fasse pas au détriment de personnes contraintes de fuir d’autres régions en crise., Ne pas séparer les familles, La CRS estime qu’il est essentiel que les familles ne soient pas séparées aux frontières. Le regroupement familial auprès de ressortissants ukrainiens habitant en Suisse doit être possible rapidement et sans complications. Les demandes de regroupement familial doivent être traitées en priorité, dans le cadre d’une procédure accélérée et sur la base de critères pragmatiques adaptés au contexte.

How you can help the people of Ukraine,News and Press Release,FIDH,Protection and Human Rights,3 Mar 2022,"Only seven days into Russia’s armed aggression against Ukraine, the situation is rapidly deteriorating as Russian troops are advancing and occupying more Ukrainian territory. Ukraine is mounting a fierce resistance in these dire circumstances, but their resilience alone is not enough to withstand the bombs and tanks; it is crucial that the international community continue its support., There have been reliable reports of hundreds of civilian deaths and tens of thousands of horrific injuries to civilians as a result of indiscriminate bombardments. Millions of Ukrainians have been deprived of food, water, electricity and other basic necessities. Ukrainian human rights organisations—including the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH)’s Kyiv-based member organisation, the Center for Civil Liberties (CCL)—are fighting for survival in bomb shelters, while courageously continuing to document violations and to bring the voice of Ukrainian civil society to the outside world., This devastating invasion has also led hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee, attempting to reach Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Western Europe. In unacceptable instances of racism on train platforms, persons of foreign origin, including from Africa and Asia, particularly students, have been denied access to trains leaving Ukraine., Ukraine: what you can do, In the midst of the constant flow of information—and faced with uncertainty—it is easy to feel overwhelmed and powerless, but we can all contribute to supporting the people in Ukraine in these difficult times. On the map below, you will find various ways to help, including hosting a refugee in your home, providing funds to aid relief efforts, supporting and learning from independent Ukrainian media, and more., As the situation in Ukraine unfolds, the needs of citizens in the country and neighbouring regions are sure to change. We will be keeping this resource up to date with the ways you can help respond to the evolving needs., Ukraine: what is happening?

Women flee and show solidarity as a military offensive ravages Ukraine [EN/RU],News and Press Release,UN Women,Protection and Human Rights,3 Mar 2022,"Across Ukraine on 24 February, people awoke to the sounds of sirens and explosions as Russia began its military attack. Since that morning, 1 million Ukrainians – the vast majority women and children – have fled to neighbouring countries. Another 160,000 people have been internally displaced across Ukraine amid frigid winter temperatures. These numbers are expected to increase significantly as the offensive continues, reversing important gains made on gender equality and women’s rights., “I urge the international community, as it rallies in support, to keep women and girls at the centre and to ensure that the humanitarian assistance planned and provided is gender-responsive,” said UN Women Executive Director, Sima Bahous, in a statement., Ukraine is one of the poorest countries in Europe, with women among those most disadvantaged. Employment and economic activity among working-aged women in Ukraine are far lower than for men. Women constitute 72.2% of social assistance recipients. And with a 22% gender pay gap and 32% pension gap, women are more vulnerable to the humanitarian crisis. Women also shoulder the greatest burden of unpaid domestic and care work in households and make up 92.2% of single parents., Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic had already exacerbated women’s vulnerability to income loss and domestic violence and exposed them to additional unpaid work and high psychological pressure., And even before the recent escalation, conflict was raging in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and women and girls were severely impacted. Already, more than 1.5 million people – two-thirds women and children – were internally displaced and suffering from impeded access to health care, housing and employment. The current military offensive is only going to exacerbate this situation., Evidence inarguably demonstrates that women and girls are disproportionately affected by conflict. The UN estimates that 54 per cent of people in need of assistance from the ongoing crisis are women., “UN Women will use its expertise in Ukraine and neighbouring countries to identify and respond to women and girls’ specific needs, as they evolve. We will redirect our programming on the ground and share our gender expertise with the UN system and our humanitarian partners to help make humanitarian response plans and their implementation more gender-responsive,” says Alia El-Yassir, UN Women Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia in an article., As the military attacks intensify, more Ukrainians are fleeing and families are being separated. Thousands of people – mostly women and children – have fled to the Palanca-Maiaki-Udobnoe border crossing to the Republic of Moldova to seek refuge or transit through the country to Romania and then other European Union countries., “Our minds can’t conceive what is happening; we just can’t understand,” says Margarita, a 22-year-old refugee from Odessa, southern Ukraine. She came to Moldova with her mother, two little brothers and their cat. Their father remained in Odessa to defend their home. They intend to go to Romania, and then to the Czech Republic., In solidarity, many women volunteers have flocked to the border crossing to support the refugees from Ukraine. “I came to volunteer because I am myself a mother, and as refugees are mostly women and children, I could not stand by,” says Ina, a 31-year-old mother of three, on her first day as a volunteer., “I just couldn’t stay in my warm office and work. It is only human for us to be here and help,” adds Liuba another volunteer who came to the border with her colleagues., “The majority of those arriving are women with children, and they are scared and vulnerable and need psychological assistance,” says Veronica, a 31-year-old Moldovan psychologist working with the Moldova border police who has been deployed to the border to offer psychological counselling to women and children., In Moldova, UN Women is planning targeted interventions and developing its humanitarian response for Ukrainian refugees., UN Women has been present in Ukraine since 2015, including with offices in conflict-affected areas of eastern Ukraine, supporting social mobilization among women, advancing their resilience, livelihoods and boosting their capacities and confidence, including by helping them form self-help groups., “Since starting our work in Ukraine in 2015, the resilience of women and girls, their expertise and commitment to build a just, democratic society for all has been growing, and informed our work. We will continue to call for women’s rights to be respected, their voices to be meaningfully included in decision-making, and resources to be fairly allocated for gender-responsive initiatives during and in the aftermath of this crisis,” says Erika Kvapilova, UN Women Representative in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/women-flee-and-show-solidarity-military-offensive-ravages-ukraine-enru
Ukraine: Countries Request ICC War Crimes Inquiry,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,2 Mar 2022,"Mounting Efforts Pave Way for Justice, Thirty-eight governments have taken a significant step toward ensuring documentation of potential war crimes by asking the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor to open an investigation in Ukraine, Human Rights Watch said today. On February 28, 2022, the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, signaled his intention to seek to open a formal inquiry., On March 2, 2022, a group of ICC member countries referred the situation in Ukraine to the court’s prosecutor for investigation. Lithuania made a separate referral to the ICC prosecutor’s office on February 28. The complete list of countries is below., “The request for an ICC investigation reflects the growing alarm among countries about the escalating atrocities and human rights crisis that has gripped Ukraine,” said Balkees Jarrah, interim international justice director at Human Rights Watch. “These governments are making clear that serious crimes will not be tolerated and that the court has an essential role to play in ensuring justice.”, Human Rights Watch and others have documented serious violations of the laws of war by Russian forces in Ukraine, including the use of cluster munitions that hit a hospital and a preschool. According to the United Nations, civilian casualties from the first days of the conflict are at 536, including 136 deaths., The referral follows an announcement by the ICC prosecutor that he would seek to open a formal Ukraine investigation that would include scrutiny of any alleged serious crimes in the current conflict. With a referral to the court by ICC member countries, the prosecutor’s office can open an investigation without first seeking approval of a panel of the court’s judges. After receipt of the referral, Khan announced that his office would immediately proceed with a Ukraine inquiry., Ukraine is not a member of the ICC, but it accepted the court’s jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed on its territory since November 2013, and in doing so, the obligation to cooperate with the court. In December 2020, the then-ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, concluded her preliminary examination of the situation and announced that the criteria under the ICC’s founding treaty, the Rome Statute, had been met to open an investigation. But the prosecutor’s office did not subsequently seek judicial approval to open an investigation as required by the court’s procedure, citing “operational challenges,” including limited resources and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic., In a recent announcement, Khan confirmed that he believed there was a basis to open an investigation, with respect to alleged crimes committed in Crimea and eastern Ukraine as well as any new alleged crimes in the current conflict. On March 2, the ICC presidency assigned the Ukraine situation to a panel of judges following a memorandum from the prosecutor indicating his intention to seek authorization to open a formal investigation. After receiving the referral, Khan notified the court’s Presidency of his plans to immediately proceed with an investigation., Because Russia is not a member of the ICC, its authorities are not bound to cooperate with the court. However, under the court’s rules governing its jurisdiction, the ICC prosecutor has a mandate to impartially investigate allegations of crimes committed in Ukraine by all parties to the conflict, regardless of the nationality of the person allegedly responsible. Bensouda’s decision to examine whether to investigate in Ukraine precipitated Russia’s “un-signing” of the court’s treaty in 2016, a move with mostly symbolic effect., The ICC’s jurisdiction in Ukraine covers genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Liability for these crimes is not limited to those who carry out the acts, but also those who order, assist, or are otherwise complicit in the crimes. That includes liability on the basis of command responsibility in which military and civilian officials, up to the top of the chain of command, can be held criminally responsible for crimes committed by their subordinates; when they knew or should have known that such crimes were being committed, but failed to take reasonable measures to stop them., Given that neither Ukraine nor Russia are members of the ICC, the court does not have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in this situation., The ICC’s mandate relates to cases against individual alleged perpetrators while the International Court of Justice (ICJ) considers disputes between states. On February 26, Ukraine filed an application at the ICJ to initiate proceedings against Russia under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Genocide Convention). The case is “state-to-state” litigation governed by legal provisions in the UN Charter, the ICJ Statute, and the Genocide Convention. The ICJ will hold public hearings in the case between March 7 and 8 on Ukraine’s request for provisional measures., With the Ukraine investigation, the number of open country situations under investigation before the court has risen to 17 – including an investigation into crimes committed during the 2008 war between Georgia and Russia. Other ongoing investigations relate to serious international crimes committed around the world including in Bangladesh/Myanmar, Afghanistan, and Palestine., ICC member countries should step up to ensure the court has sufficient means and political backing to do its vital work on behalf of victims of grave abuses around the world, including in the face of any obstruction. An effective ICC backed by the strong support of the international community is needed more than ever to send the message that impunity for any serious crimes will not be tolerated, Human Rights Watch said., The ICC prosecutor tasked his office to explore all opportunities to preserve evidence for a Ukraine investigation. Separately, the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) is set to vote this week during an urgent debate on the situation in Ukraine on a draft resolution that would create a commission of inquiry to document serious human rights violations, preserve evidence, and identify alleged those responsible for serious crimes., Documentation efforts will be vital to international and domestic accountability processes, including by national judicial officials under the principle of universal jurisdiction. Governments committed to justice in Ukraine should support and bolster these initiatives, Human Rights Watch said., “The ICC prosecutor’s decision to open an investigation sends a message to current and would-be rights abusers, no matter how powerful, that justice may one day catch up with them,” Jarrah said. “Broad support for the court’s work will be critical to the investigation’s success and help ensure that victims in Ukraine have a path to justice that they so desperately need.”, Countries that requested the investigation are:, Albania, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-countries-request-icc-war-crimes-inquiry
La Asamblea General exige a Rusia la retirada inmediata de sus fuerzas militares de Ucrania [ES/PT],News and Press Release,UN News,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",2 Mar 2022,"El órgano más representativo de la ONU adopta una resolución que deplora la agresión rusa y reafirma la soberanía, independencia política e integridad territorial ucranianas. El texto también exige a Rusia revertir el reconocimiento de la independencia de Donetsk y Luhansk., La Asamblea General de las Naciones Unidas adoptó este miércoles una resolución en la que exige a la Federación de Rusia que “retire de inmediato, por completo y sin condiciones todas sus fuerzas militares del territorio de Ucrania dentro de sus fronteras reconocidas internacionalmente”., El documento, patrocinado por más de 90 países, obtuvo 141 votos a favor, cinco en contra -Rusia, Bielorrusia, Siria, Corea del Norte y Eritrea-, y 35 abstenciones . El voto se llevó a cabo luego de más de dos días de un debate en el que casi 120 representantes coincidieron en la necesidad de una solución pacífica a la crisis, aunque desde diferentes perspectivas., Las resoluciones de la Asamblea General no son vinculantes, pero reflejan la posición de los 193 Estados miembros de la ONU. La sesión de especial de emergencia y la decisión de la Asamblea se producen después de que el viernes pasado Rusia vetase una resolución en parecidos términos que habría permitido al Consejo tomar medidas, entre ellas las militares, para obligar a su cumplimiento., Además de la retirada militar rusa, el texto adoptado exige a ese país que ponga fin de inmediato al uso de la fuerza contra Ucrania y que revierta sin condiciones la decisión de reconocer la independencia de Donetsk y Luhansk., Del mismo modo, estipula que Rusia debe abstenerse de recurrir a cualquier otra forma ilícita de amenaza o uso de la fuerza contra cualquier otro Estado Miembro., Otra exigencia de la Asamblea es que todas las partes permitan el paso seguro e irrestricto a quienes busquen salir del país, que faciliten la entrada y distribución de asistencia humanitaria, que protejan a la población civil sin distinciones de ningún tipo, y que respeten los derechos humanos., Deplora la participación de Bielorrusia, El texto “deplora en los términos más enérgicos la agresión de Rusia contra Ucrania”, que contraviene la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y condena las violaciones del derecho internacional humanitario y los abusos de las garantías fundamentales., Por otra parte, deplora “la participación de Bielorrusia en este uso ilícito de la fuerza contra Ucrania y exhorta al país a que cumpla sus obligaciones internacionales”., La resolución dispone que todas las partes cumplan plenamente sus obligaciones en virtud del derecho internacional humanitario para no atacar ni dañar a la población ni a los bienes de carácter civil, que no ataquen bienes indispensables para la supervivencia de los civiles y que respeten al personal y suministros humanitarios., La Asamblea General también exhortó a las partes a que cumplan los acuerdos de Minsk e insta a la resolución pacífica del conflicto entre Rusia y Ucrania “mediante el diálogo político, las negociaciones, la mediación y otros medios pacíficos”., En otro punto, acoge con beneplácito los esfuerzos continuos del Secretario General de la ONU, los Estados miembros y diversos organismos internacionales por distender la situación y promover el diálogo., En el texto previo a las estipulaciones, la resolución explica que toma esas previsiones “condenando la declaración hecha por la Federación de Rusia el 24 de febrero de 2022 de llevar a cabo una ‘operación militar especial’ en Ucrania, al igual que la decisión rusa “de mejorar el nivel de preparación de sus fuerzas nucleares”., Ucrania necesita la paz y el mundo la exige, Inmediatamente después de la votación, el Secretario General, quien estuvo presente durante toda la sesión al lado del presidente de la Asamblea, salió unos momentos de la sala para dirigirse a la prensa., “La Asamblea General ha hablado. (…) El mensaje es alto y claro: Poner fin a las hostilidades en Ucrania, ahora. Silencien las armas, ahora. Abra la puerta al diálogo y la diplomacia, ahora”, declaró António Guterres., Agregó que no hay tiempo que perder porque si bien los efectos brutales del conflicto ya son evidentes, la situación puede empeorar mucho más para la población ucraniana., “La resolución de hoy refleja una verdad fundamental. El mundo quiere poner fin al tremendo sufrimiento humano en Ucrania”, enfatizó., Guterres planteó nuevamente su preocupación por las consecuencias regionales y mundiales que el conflicto entre Rusia y Ucrania puede tener en términos de paz y seguridad., En otra línea, el titular de la ONU hizo hincapié en la rápida movilización de fondos para las operaciones humanitarias en Ucrania y sus países vecinos y recalcó la enorme generosidad internacional observada ayer en la respuesta al llamamiento a recaudar recursos para brindar asistencia vital a la población afectada., Con ese dinero, las agencias de las Naciones Unidas podrán aumentar la entrega de suministros médicos y de salud, alimentos, agua potable, refugio y protección., “De cara al futuro, continuaré haciendo todo lo que esté a mi alcance para contribuir a un cese inmediato de las hostilidades y negociaciones urgentes para la paz. La gente en Ucrania necesita desesperadamente la paz. Y la gente de todo el mundo la exige”, concluyó el Secretario General antes de volver a la sala de la Asamblea., Intervención “no provocada”, Antes de la votación, la embajadora de Estados Unidos ante la ONU, una de las últimas oradoras del debate, instó a Rusia a detener su intervención “no provocada” en Ucrania y llamó a Bielorrusia a dejar de apoyar y facilitar la agresión., Linda Thomas-Greenfield acusó a Rusia de violar las leyes internacionales y recordó que el trabajo de los Estados reunidos en la Asamblea General es detener la guerra., La diplomática estadounidense responsabilizó a las fuerzas rusas de lanzar ataques contra la población e infraestructura civil y abogó por el bienestar de los refugiados, sin ninguna distinción, en los países que los están acogiendo., Ucrania y Rusia, El representante de Ucrania, Sergiy Kyslytsya, presentó la resolución al pleno antes de proceder al voto pidiendo apoyo para el texto y afirmando que Rusia está cometiendo un genocidio en su país., Kyslytsya agradeció además las expresiones de solidaridad mundial y la acogida de refugiados en los países vecinos., También antes de la votación, el embajador de Rusia, Vassily Nebenzia, denunció la presión ejercida por los países occidentales sobre muchos Estados para que votaran a favor y exhortó al pleno a no apoyar el documento, argumentando que no contribuiría al fin de la operación militar sino que exacerbaría a los nacionalistas radicales ucranianos que tienen como rehén a los civiles y que no son mencionados en la resolución., Nebenzia negó categóricamente las acusaciones de bombardeos en áreas civiles, llamó a no caer en la trampa de la información falsa, y acotó que quienes verdaderamente están interesados en Ucrania entienden el origen de la situación., La resolución no alude a las preocupaciones de seguridad de las partes, Tras la votación, numerosos representantes explicaron el porqué de la posición de sus países con respecto a la resolución., China, uno de los cinco miembros permanentes del Consejo de Seguridad se abstuvo de respaldar el texto, como lo había hecho en ese órgano resolutivo. Su embajador expuso la falta de consultas con todos los Estados miembros para la redacción del documento, una imputación compartida por Sudáfrica, que también se abstuvo diciendo que hubieran preferido un proceso abierto y transparente para su elaboración., Otro punto destacado por China fue la falta de profundidad de la resolución en cuanto a las preocupaciones de seguridad de las partes, que son causa del conflicto, por lo que llamó una vez más a abandonar la mentalidad de Guerra Fría y a no extender los bloques militares ni a reforzar la seguridad de Europa a costa de la seguridad rusa., La falta de mención de la seguridad de los países involucrados también dejó inconformes a Sudáfrica -que las resaltó como origen del conflicto- y a Brasil., El país sudamericano señaló que si bien votó a favor por estar del lado de la paz, la resolución se queda corta al no abordar esas preocupaciones. Más que la retirada de las tropas es eso lo que hace falta para resolver pacíficamente el conflicto, aseveró su representante., Como China, India fue otro país que se abstuvo en el Consejo de Seguridad y en la Asamblea General y que se manifestó a favor de la paz, la entrada de ayuda humanitaria y urgió a “todos los Estados miembros a mostrar su compromiso con los principios de la Carta de la ONU”, respetando la soberanía e integridad de “todos los Estados”., En el mismo tenor, la representante de los Emiratos Árabes Unidos -nación que se abstuvo en el Consejo de Seguridad- subrayó que su país votó a favor en esta ocasión, pero que es de la idea de que la solidaridad no significa preocuparse por resolver los conflictos en algunas zonas del mundo e ignorar los de otros lugares, donde llevan mucho tiempo devastando países., Votos en contra, Entre los votos en contra, Eritrea y Siria detallaron el motivo de esta decisión. Eritrea dijo haber rechazado el texto por estar en contra de las sanciones unilaterales que se vienen imponiendo a Rusia por ser ilegales y contraproducentes. Sostuvo que lo que se necesita es resolver los problemas de seguridad de los países enfrentados y que esas imposiciones lejos de solucionarlos, los agudizan. El representante eritreo abogó entonces por una solución diplomática., Siria, por su parte, enfatizó la doble moral -un aspecto aludido por otros países, como Saint Kitts-Nevis, aunque éste votó a favor- de algunos miembros de la comunidad internacional que en el caso de Ucrania se apresuran a pedir la retirada de Rusia, mientras que durante décadas han permitido la ocupación israelí de los Territorios Palestinos y de los Altos del Golán.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/la-asamblea-general-exige-rusia-la-retirada-inmediata-de-sus-fuerzas-militares-de

General Assembly resolution demands end to Russian offensive in Ukraine [EN/AR/RU/ZH/SW/HI],News and Press Release,UN News,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",2 Mar 2022,"The UN General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution on Wednesday demanding that Russia immediately end its military operations in Ukraine., Known informally as the world’s “town hall”, the Assembly is where all 193 UN Member States have a voice. A total of 141 countries voted in favour of the resolution, which reaffirms Ukrainian sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity., Assembly President Abdulla Shahid struggled to read the results of the vote as ambassadors began applauding, and then standing up, as he started speaking., 'Unconditionally withdraw', The resolution demands that Russia “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.”, It was sponsored by more than 90 countries and needed a two-thirds majority in the Assembly to pass., Five countries - Belarus, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (more commonly known as North Korea) Eritrea, Russia and Syria - voted against it, while 35 abstained., The voting capped off a rare special emergency session of the General Assembly that began on Monday, during which countries took to the podium to declare their positions on the crisis, now entering a second week., ‘Loud and clear’, Speaking afterwards to reporters, Mr. Shahid said the resolution reflected the international community’s grave concerns about the situation in Ukraine., “I join Member States in expressing concern about ‘reports of attacks on civilian facilities such as residences, schools and hospitals, and of civilian casualties, including women, older persons, persons with disabilities, and children’,” he said, citing the text., UN Secretary-General António Guterres, who also addressed reporters, stated he was duty bound to stand by the resolution and be guided by its call., “The message of the General Assembly is loud and clear: End hostilities in Ukraine now. Silence the guns now. Open the door to dialogue and diplomacy now.”, Clock is ticking, The UN chief stressed the need to act quickly as the situation in Ukraine threatens to get much worse, adding “the ticking clock is a time bomb.”, A humanitarian appeal launched on Tuesday has been met with “record generosity”, he said, which will allow for a scale-up in the delivery of vital assistance, including medical and health supplies, as well as food, water and protection., “Looking ahead, I will continue to do everything in my power to contribute to an immediate cessation of hostilities and urgent negotiations for peace,” Mr. Guterres told journalists., Reason to believe, “People in Ukraine desperately need peace. And people around the world demand it.”, For Ukraine’s Ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, this was “a defining day,” recalling words from his statement in the Assembly., “The UN is still alive and going through the process of catharsis,” he said. “I believe in the United Nations; now people in Ukraine have more reasons to believe in the United Nations.”, Watch comments to the media by Abdulla Shahid, President of the General Assembly, following the vote",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/general-assembly-resolution-demands-end-russian-offensive-ukraine-enarruzhswhi

The next report will be produced on 3 March., HIGHLIGHTS, Fighting, airstrikes, artillery shelling and overall violence across several parts of the country have killed 227 civilians, including 15 children. A further 525 civilians, including 28 children have been injured, according to Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) report which covers the 24 February to 1 March period., Damage and destruction to civilian infrastructure in areas of active fighting and those affected by airstrikes and shelling continue to impede people’s access to water, food, healthcare and other basic services. This is also impacting the ability of partners to scale-up and expand programmes inside Ukraine., More than 870,000 people have crossed Ukraine’s borders since 24 February, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Most of the people fleeing Ukraine are women, girls and boys. Tracking the number of internally displaced people is challenging due to the fluidity of the situation. Ukraine’s main railroad company facilitating evacuations noted that by 28 February, more than 500,000 people had been evacuated, mostly from eastern and central parts of the country towards western oblasts., The humanitarian needs of people affected, those on the move and internally displaced are critical. The Health Cluster stressed that trauma care and primary care, essential medicine and medical supplies are urgently needed. People also need access to food as well as support with non-food items, such as household necessities. The key protection concern is to facilitate safe and dignified evacuation of vulnerable people, including people with disabilities, older persons, women and children., SITUATION OVERVIEW, At least 202 civilians have been killed or injured across conflict-affected areas in Ukraine between this and the previous reporting period, when 550 civilian casualties were recorded by OHCHR. The number of civilians killed or injured since the military offensive on 24 February has now reached 752 in total (525 injured and 227 killed), with eastern Ukraine’s Donetska and Luhanska oblasts accounting for the highest number of cases, followed by central, southern and northern parts of the country. Of the total killed, 31 are men, 25 are women, 15 are children; the sex of remaining 156 is yet unknown). OHCHR maintains that real figures are considerably higher, as there is a delay in receiving information from some locations where there are active hostilities, and many reports are still pending corroboration., Reports of damage to civilian infrastructure, especially residential buildings, have continued, especially in densely populated cities of Donetsk, Chernihiv, Horlivka, Kharkiv, in and around Kyiv, Mariupol, Sievierodonetsk and Zhytomyr. Active shelling and airstrikes have also continued in other locations on both sides of the “contact line” in eastern Ukraine as well as in smaller settlements in northern, central and southern parts of the country. Reports of disruptions to electricity lines as well as gas and water supply systems are alarming, especially as Ukraine temperatures are still largely below zero. Hospitals and schools are also reportedly coming under constant fire, including in areas on both sides of the “contact line” in eastern Ukraine, where the conflict remains most active., The number of people fleeing the country is rapidly rising. Close to 200,000 people have crossed the border between this and the previous reporting period, according to UNHCR. This number is almost double the daily average before 1 March. Between 24 February and 1 March, UNHCR recorded 874,000 Ukrainian refugees, with Poland, Hungary and Moldova the top three destination countries. The number of internally displaced people has not yet been fully identified, although initial estimates by UNHCR stated that over 100,000 IDPs by 28 February. The actual number is considered to be much higher. Earlier on 28 February, the Ukrainian railway company noted that more than half a million people had been evacuated towards western parts of the country, and local reports indicate that not all of the people moving internally are planning to cross international borders., Programme disruptions coupled with conflict conditions continue to increase the affected population’s vulnerability to communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, polio and measles. Poor vaccination coverage increases the risk of outbreaks of preventable communicable diseases, particularly among children. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the recent reported cases of polio in the western part of the country highlight this risk. In addition, confinement conditions in shelters, population displacement, and infrastructure damage, make hygiene difficult to maintain, increasing the risk of respiratory and diarrheal diseases, which could rapidly have a large impact.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-500-pm-eet-2-march-2022

They did not provide disaggregated data regarding civilian and military casualties. On 1 March, the Minister of Health of Ukraine said that 16 children have been killed since 24 February.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civilian-casualties-2400-1-march-2022-enruuk

Ukraine: Salesian Missions launches emergency appeal to aid refugees,News and Press Release,Salesians,Shelter and Non-Food Items,2 Mar 2022,"Salesian missionaries are still working in Ukraine and helping families in need, (MissionNewswire) Salesian Missions, the U.S. development arm of the Salesians of Don Bosco, has launched an emergency appeal to aid Ukrainian refugees. The Ukraine Emergency Relief Fund will provide support to provide shelter, nutrition and supplies to refugees in need. Salesian missionaries living and working in Ukraine and surrounding countries who are sheltering refugees are doing everything possible to help those in need during this difficult time., UNHCR, the U.N. Refugee Agency, has said that more than 660,000 refugees have fled Ukraine for neighboring countries, the majority of whom are women, children and the elderly. Families have been torn apart as fathers, husbands and brothers have remained in Ukraine to fight. The U.N. has estimated the conflict could produce as many as 4 million refugees., Working within their local communities, Salesians are providing shelter in their houses and schools while also calling on the international community for aid. Several Salesian provinces around the globe have already pledged support, including Salesian Missions., “Salesian missionaries are doing everything possible to help those in need including providing emergency transport and shelter,” said Father Gus Baek, director of Salesian Missions. “There are Salesian missionaries still working in Ukraine and in the neighboring countries risking their lives while helping families in need. To do that most effectively, we need donor support.”, In addition to Salesian centers welcoming refugees, Salesians in Ukraine are sheltering minors and their families who have remained in the country. Father Chaban Mykahylo, superior of the Mary Help of Christians Vice-Province of Ukraine of the Greek Catholic Rite, said, “This situation continues to be tragic. We do not know how long this war will continue, and we must be ready for a long period. There are many victims among the soldiers, but also among civilians. Throughout Ukraine, there is a danger of bombing. Our capital, Kyiv, is suffering a lot, as well as the areas bordering Russia. People are fleeing their homes and are in need of our help.”, To help support refugees, donate to the Salesian Missions Ukraine Emergency Relief Fund., ###, Sources:, ANS Photo (usage permissions and guidelines must be requested from ANS), ANS – Ukraine – Salesians in the current difficult situation, ANS – Ukraine – Ukrainian people moving in search of safety, ANS – RMG – The Salesian world moves to support Ukraine, Salesian Missions",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-salesian-missions-launches-emergency-appeal-aid-refugees

Emergency response teams across The Salvation Army’s global network continue their tireless efforts, providing critical relief, strategic planning and emotional support through conditions of extreme challenge and distress., EASTERN EUROPE, Salvationists from the Eastern Europe Territory sprang into action with initial relief operations being delivered in Moldova, Romania and Ukraine. In Moldova, The Salvation Army is supporting refugees from Ukraine through the provision of free temporary accommodation and access to Wi-Fi, made possible by Salvation Army officers (ministers), staff and the innovative employment of Salvation Army buildings and facilities. Salvationists of all ages are bolstering the efforts through the preparation and distribution of hot meals, drinks and parcels containing essential items., The Salvation Army in Romania has sent emergency teams to work at border crossings in Siret and Isaccea, alongside other agencies and individuals, providing food and hygiene items to the large influx of Ukrainian refugees. At the Siret ferry, these teams have been of particular support to women, children and older people. Assistance for displaced people is evident beyond the border work in Romania, with one mother and her two children located to safety in Budapest from the cultural capital of Iași, solely through the aid of Salvation Army connections across Europe., In various locations across Ukraine, particularly in border towns like the city of Lviv, internally displaced people are being supported through the supply of food and non-food items. Salvation Army corps (churches) and centres, such as those in Vinnytsia and Dnipro, are ready to give help where needed. Such relief work, and other ongoing activities, is taking place on all sides of the border, with The Salvation Army in Russia providing essential items to those affected., REST OF EUROPE, The wider Salvation Army emergency response is being formulated and effected across other European countries. In Poland, relief parcels are being prepared for the anticipated arrival of 100,000 Ukrainian refugees per day. Damaris Frick and Captain Matthew Beatty, of International Emergency Services (International Headquarters), are strategy planning with colleagues on the front line. Salvation Army leadership and response teams in Slovakia and the Czech Republic are also assessing and preparing vital aid for the certain flow of displaced people, with representatives from both countries meeting together on a regular basis., Salvationists and friends across the international Salvation Army have responded to this crisis with an attitude of care, compassion and concern for their brothers and sisters in Ukraine and Russia through prayer and, where possible, through financial donation. General Brian Peddle, international leader of The Salvation Army, has contacted leaders to assure them of the deep support they have from ‘our international family’, which transcends borders and national identity., ‘Pray for peace in this troubled time,’ the General has prompted Salvationists. ‘Pray for the safety of those who are fleeing and for those who are already displaced; pray that there will be adequate hospitality from neighbour countries; for faith and courage for every Christian and especially for our people; and pray for the de-escalation of the battle so that the threat to life is no longer a reality.’",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/salvation-army-responds-russia-and-ukraine-crisis
Ukraine: War has an impact on people’s health beyond bullets and bombs,News and Press Release,The Conversation,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",2 Mar 2022,"According to the UN human rights office, 136 civilians have died in the war on Ukraine so far. But it acknowledges that the figure is probably much higher., These deaths may have occurred directly – collateral damage to the fighting – but war affects people’s health beyond bullets and bombs. Some deaths are not combat-related but the result of the wider effects of conflict on public health – effects that linger long after the war has ended. The Russian invasion of Ukraine will undoubtedly bring with it catastrophic suffering and health consequences for the civilian population., Wars are complex health emergencies. They lead to the breakdown of society, cause considerable damage and destruction to infrastructure, create insecurity and have a significant economic impact. They also exacerbate pre-war issues., Even before the Russian invasion, the eight-year-long conflict in eastern Ukraine had left 3 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. Women, children, the elderly and people with disabilities, in particular, are often most in need of help., As we are seeing in Ukraine and its neighbouring countries, war generates mass population movements, both within the country (so-called internally displaced persons) and externally (refugees). In less than a week, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has created nearly half a million refugees. Heartbreaking scenes of families separated, not knowing when or if they will next see each other again, have become commonplace., Health systems take a hammering, The health system suffers too due to the damage to health infrastructure such as hospitals and clinics. It triggers the flight of health staff, leaving understaffed health systems to cope with growing patient loads caused by the conflict. This is on top of the interruptions to supply chains., Most hospitals rarely have stocks of drugs and consumables beyond a few days due to storage-space constraints and the cost of keeping large inventories. These stocks are rapidly consumed, particularly items needed for treating war injuries, such as antibiotics, blood products and dressings. Sadly, this is now the case at Chernihiv children’s hospital, which is surrounded by Russian forces and rapidly running out of essential drugs for children with cancer., The World Health Organization has also warned that medical oxygen supplies in Ukraine are dangerously low., It will be immensely difficult to deliver healthcare in Ukraine, and the full extent of disruption to the health system will be difficult to ascertain, especially as IT systems will also have been affected. This is further compounded by the ongoing surge in COVID, with around 1,700 patients currently in hospitals across the country., Beyond hospitals, primary care, screening and immunisation programmes will have been disrupted. This means that people with chronic diseases such as diabetes or heart failure may not get optimal treatment – if any at all. The cessation of screening programmes means cancers are missed or diagnosed late., The risk of infectious diseases spreading is also heightened if the supply of clean water and functioning sanitation systems are compromised. And the disruption of immunisation programmes, leading to lower vaccine coverage, increases the risks of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and polio. The Syrian conflict, for example, substantially reduced polio vaccine coverage, which led to an outbreak of polio in 2017., As in peacetime, wars do not affect all population groups equally. For instance, women are particularly vulnerable when fleeing conflict zones because of the disruption of protective social networks and the loss of access to healthcare. More worrying is the risk of sexual violence such as rape. The conflict in Yemen, for example, led to a significant increase in reports of gender-based violence., Wars will leave many scarred and disabled. But wars do not just cause physical harm, they can also have considerable mental health consequences, ranging from depression and anxiety disorders to post-traumatic stress disorder. They can affect both combatants and non-combatants, children and adults, on those left behind, as well as on internally displaced people and refugees. Wars can lead to significant psychological trauma, especially in children., Economic sanctions, Sanctions have been imposed on Russia, but they don’t have a great track record of success. Usually, the effect of sanctions is experienced most by civilians. For example, ten years of economic sanctions on Iraq in the 1990s did not remove Saddam Hussein from power but was linked to an increase in deaths in children under the age of five., Economic sanctions may create social disruption and material deprivation, as well as reduce the availability of drugs, vaccines and spare parts for health equipment. Prolonged economic sanctions on Russia will hurt ordinary citizens but probably leave the ruling elite relatively unscathed., After wars, both economic losses and diseases are highly persistent. They don’t stop once the fighting stops. The post-war period is often characterised by insecurity, political fragility, damaged and degraded infrastructure, limited healthcare capacity and staffing, unemployment, and shortages of all manner of goods. There will be residual effects on the economy, as well as disrupted family and social networks., There will also be the urgent task of clearing unexploded ordnance, including mines. Unexploded ordnance from the Vietnam war, for example, continues to maim civilians decades later., When the fighting stops, there will be the need for disarmament and demobilisation of former combatants, and the important task of reintegration. The post-war period will last many years, and Ukraine will undoubtedly need considerable international support and funding to rebuild and recover afterwards., Original article",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-war-has-impact-people-s-health-beyond-bullets-and-bombs

Protection and Human Rights",1 Mar 2022,"01 mars 2022, Au deuxième jour de son débat de haut niveau, le Conseil des droits de l'homme a entendu ce matin les déclarations de plus d'une vingtaine de hauts dignitaires, parmi lesquels le Ministre russe des affaires étrangères, M. Sergey Lavrov., Les intervenants qui se sont exprimés ce matin ont largement condamné l'agression « non provoquée » de la Fédération de Russie contre l'Ukraine. Le Haut-Représentant de l'Union européenne pour les affaires étrangères et la politique de sécurité et Vice-Président de la Commission européenne, M. Josep Borrell Fontelles, a constaté que la Fédération de Russie poursuivait son agression militaire contre l'Ukraine, notamment ses attaques contre des civils. « Il ne s'agit pas seulement d'une attaque contre une Ukraine libre, démocratique et pacifique. C'est une attaque contre la stabilité et la sécurité mondiales, une violation gravissime du droit international ainsi que des principes fondamentaux de la coexistence humaine », a déploré le Haut-Représentant. Il a affirmé que l'Union européenne soutenait le Gouvernement démocratiquement élu de l'Ukraine et ses efforts pour défendre son territoire et son peuple., M. Borrell a mis en garde contre une « tentative de la Fédération de Russie, entre autres pays, de remodeler les principes fondamentaux des relations internationales en relativisant les concepts clefs des droits de l'homme et de la démocratie, et en arguant que seuls les États sont souverains, et non les peuples ». L'Union européenne, a-t-il assuré, n'acceptera aucun effort visant à saper les libertés fondamentales ou les obligations internationales existantes en matière de droits de l'homme. M. Borrell a appelé « tous les membres de l'ONU, grands et petits, à agir avec nous pour défendre les principes et les valeurs de l'ONU et de ce Conseil des droits de l'homme. », Par vidéoconférence, le Ministre russe des affaires étrangères, M. Sergey Lavrov, a relevé que la situation dans le monde se détériore sous nos yeux et a déclaré que la raison principale en est que les États-Unis et leurs alliés continuent d'imposer de manière agressive le « soi-disant ordre mondial fondé sur des règles ». Affirmant que les « ultranationalistes et les néonazis » qui ont pris le pouvoir à Kiev lors d'un coup d'État soutenu par l'Occident ont « déclenché une véritable terreur », M. Lavrov a expliqué que dans ce contexte, la Fédération de Russie ne pouvait rester indifférente au sort des quatre millions de personnes du Donbass. Le but de notre action est de sauver des personnes, et de « démilitariser et dénazifier l'Ukraine », a-t-il déclaré., En ce qui le concerne, le Président Poutine a souligné à plusieurs reprises que la Fédération de Russie a un respect indéfectible pour le peuple ukrainien, sa langue et ses traditions. Nous n'avons nullement l'intention de porter atteinte aux intérêts des citoyens de l'Ukraine, a ajouté M. Lavrov. Il a rappelé qu'à la demande du Président Zelensky, des négociations ont commencé entre les deux pays et a dit espérer que « la partie ukrainienne est consciente de la gravité de la situation et de sa responsabilité »., Au cours de cette séance, plus d'une vingtaine de hauts dignitaires ont pris la parole. Il s'agissait du Président du Costa Rica, du Haut-Représentant de l'Union européenne pour les affaires étrangères et la politique de sécurité, ainsi que de ministres, vice-ministres ou secrétaires d'État des pays ci-après : Nigéria, Timor-Leste, République tchèque, Guatemala, Sri Lanka, Angola, Syrie, Mozambique, Namibie, Bahreïn, Chypre, Fédération de Russie, Danemark, Autriche, Roumanie, Bulgarie, République de Corée, Portugal et Royaume-Uni., Le Conseil poursuit cet après-midi, à 15 heures, son débat de haut niveau., Suite du débat de haut niveau, M. CARLOS ALVARADO QUESADA, Président du Costa Rica, a déclaré qu' « une action courageuse que pourrait prendre un dirigeant serait de retirer ses soldats » et a souligné qu'en quatre jours, plusieurs centaines de milliers de personnes en Ukraine ont dû quitter leurs foyers. Comme si la pandémie n'avait pas suffi, l'impact économique de cette guerre se fait sentir partout, ajouté le Président costaricien. La pire menace pour la planète réside dans le manque de bon sens de l'homme, a-t-il fait observer. Tout dépend désormais d'un homme qui pourrait encore sauver la situation en retirant ses hommes et ses chars, a insisté le Président costaricien., Le Président a rejeté tout acte unilatéral de force contre un État et a condamné fermement l'agression de la Fédération de Russie contre l'Ukraine, qui constitue, a-t-il souligné, une violation flagrante du droit international humanitaire et du droit international des droits de l'homme. Le Président a recommandé que soient créés maintenant des mécanismes de dialogue et de coopération pour empêcher que le conflit ne se propage davantage. Il a par ailleurs rappelé qu'en 2021 le Conseil des droits de l'homme avait adopté une résolution portant reconnaissance du droit à un environnement sain et durable. Le Président costaricien a annoncé que son pays serait candidat pour être membre du Conseil pour la période 2023-2025., M. GEOFFREY ONYEAMA, Ministère des affaires étrangères du Nigéria, a souligné que les forces de sécurité nigérianes avaient continué à prendre les mesures appropriées pour traiter des défis de sécurité lancés par le terrorisme et autres actes de criminalité. Il a indiqué que – la corruption transfrontalière ayant eu un impact négatif sur la paix, la stabilité et la croissance de nombreuses économies en développement, et ayant en outre contribué à l'augmentation des migrations irrégulières, avec des conséquences considérables pour les pays d'origine, de destination et d'accueil – le Nigéria souhaitait souligner la nécessité d'une solidarité et d'une synergie entre les États Membres pour endiguer les flux financiers illicites et assurer le rapatriement inconditionnel des produits de la corruption vers les pays d'origine., M. Onyeama a ensuite jugé impératif que les États et les autres parties prenantes fassent preuve d'un réel engagement en faveur de la mise en œuvre effective et complète de la Déclaration et du Programme d'action de Durban, pour combattre vigoureusement le racisme, la discrimination raciale, la xénophobie et l'intolérance qui y est associée., Le Ministre nigérian a réitéré l'engagement de son pays en faveur de la promotion et de la protection des droits de l'homme et des libertés fondamentales, ainsi qu'en faveur des principes de démocratie, d'état de droit et de bonne gouvernance., MME ADALJIZA ALBERTINA XAVIER REIS MAGNO, Ministre des affaires étrangères et de la coopération du Timor-Leste, a fait part de ses profondes préoccupations et de la tristesse de son pays face à la situation actuelle en Ukraine. En tant que jeune démocratie qui a vécu l'occupation étrangère et a été témoin de ses conséquences, le Timor-Leste reconnaît que la guerre n'apporte aucun bénéfice. Aussi, le pays exhorte-t-il les parties au conflit à établir un dialogue diplomatique afin que le cessez-le-feu puisse être mis en œuvre immédiatement., Notre Constitution va fêter le 20 mai prochain son vingtième anniversaire, a poursuivi la Ministre, avant de rappeler que pendant la lutte pour l'indépendance, le peuple timorais avait connu de graves violations des droits de l'homme, mais aussi reçu le soutien de la communauté internationale. Notre pays est devenu l'exemple d'un pays qui a su surmonter les obstacles sur le chemin vers la paix et la démocratie, a-t-elle souligné. La Ministre a ensuite dressé un état des lieux de la situation des femmes et des enfants au Timor-Leste et a insisté sur la priorité accordée par son Gouvernement aux questions relatives aux droits de l'homme. Elle a conclu son propos en indiquant que le Timor-Leste présentait sa candidature pour devenir membre du Conseil des droits de l'homme pour la période 2024-2026., M. JAN LIPAVSKÝ, Ministre des affaires étrangères de la République tchèque, a condamné « l'agression illégale » de la Fédération de Russie contre l'Ukraine. La République tchèque se tient aux côtés du peuple ukrainien, car on ne peut le laisser seul face à « l'armée de Poutine », a-t-il déclaré. Aujourd'hui, les déclarations ne suffisent plus : il faut agir, notamment en rendant responsables les auteurs et complices de cette agression, en particulier le Bélarus, qui « facilite cette agression ». Les Présidents Loukachenko et Poutine ne sortiront pas vainqueurs de cette guerre, a prévenu le Ministre tchèque, avant d'ajouter que la Fédération de Russie utilise des uniformes de la police ukrainienne, bombarde des installations civiles et utilise des enfants comme boucliers humains., M. Lipavský a également évoqué d'autres situations de droits de l'homme qu'il a jugées « préoccupantes », évoquant notamment la situation dans la région du Xinjiang en Chine, celle des prisonniers cubains détenus uniquement pour avoir exprimé leurs opinions, ou encore les situations au Myanmar et en Afghanistan., M. MARIO ADOLFO BÚCARO FLORES, Ministre des affaires étrangères du Guatemala, a rappelé que la Constitution de son pays mettait l'accent sur le protection du droit à la vie – un principe qui, a-t-il souligné, sous-tend toute l'action publique depuis deux ans, malgré les effets de la COVID-19. Le Ministre a également insisté sur le respect nécessaire des droits des migrants et sur l'importance de remédier aux causes profondes des migrations irrégulières. Le Guatemala applique par ailleurs une approche multiculturelle des droits des peuples autochtones, dans le respect de leurs droits ancestraux ainsi que de leur vision du monde, a souligné le Ministre. Il s'est félicité, d'autre part, de la création du Forum permanent pour les personnes d'ascendance africaine. La coopération internationale est indispensable pour vaincre la pandémie de COVID-19, a ensuite souligné le Ministre, avant de remercier tous les pays amis qui ont apporté au sien une assistance sans condition pour l'aider à vacciner sa population., Le Ministre guatémaltèque a assuré que son pays, qui est attaché au respect de l'état de droit, continuerait de collaborer avec les institutions des droits de l'homme des Nations Unies, en particulier avec le Bureau au Guatemala du Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies aux droits de l'homme, de même qu'avec les institutions panaméricaines. Le Ministre des affaires étrangères a par ailleurs condamné la reconnaissance unilatérale par la Fédération de Russie des républiques séparatistes de Donetsk et Lougansk, de même que l'usage de la force militaire sur le territoire ukrainien., M. GAMINI LAKSHMAN PEIRIS, Ministre des affaires étrangères de Sri Lanka, a souligné que la tradition démocratique dans son pays garantit des élections justes, libres et ouvertes à tous. Il a ajouté que son pays, depuis la fin du conflit, avait accompli de grands progrès en vue de la réconciliation, de la reddition de comptes et de la justice sociale. Des discussions franches et honnêtes ont été mises en place avec des interlocuteurs nationaux et internationaux et Sri Lanka s'est appuyée, dans le cadre du processus de réconciliation, sur la vaste expérience des Nations Unies en matière de renforcement des droits de l'homme., M. Peiris a assuré que son pays continuait à garantir la justice sociale pour tous ses citoyens, quelles que soient leur affiliation politique ou leur identité ethnique. Grâce à l'appui de la communauté internationale, Sri Lanka est désormais mieux préparée à réagir aux différentes crises, a-t-il poursuivi, déplorant toutefois l'impuissance de son pays face à la pandémie de COVID-19 ou face à la crise qui sévit actuellement en Europe. Se demandant par ailleurs si le Conseil a été à même de surmonter le déficit de crédibilité dont l'ancienne Commission des droits de l'homme avait été accusée, il a plaidé en faveur de travaux menés [au Conseil] dans la transparence, la justice et l'impartialité. Nous rejetons toutes les mesures politiques, punitives, superflues et contre-productives, a-t-il indiqué. Les législations prises pour lutter contre le terrorisme doivent garantir le droit des personnes et notamment les libertés démocratiques et la liberté d'expression, a-t-il ajouté., MME ESMERALDA MENDONÇA, Secrétaire d'État pour les relations extérieures de la République d'Angola, a fait état de réformes que son pays envisage d'apporter à son architecture institutionnelle et législative, qui garantit les droits de tous les citoyens et l'état de droit, et a souligné que ces réformes s'inscrivent dans le contexte d'un processus électoral qui va permettre pour la première fois aux Angolais de l'étranger de voter. Ces réformes s'accompagnent d'une ouverture de l'espace civique, a-t-elle précisé. En Angola, le nombre d'organisations non gouvernementales (ONG) est passé de 300 à 800 en cinq ans, a fait valoir Mme Mendonça., Par ailleurs, a poursuivi la Secrétaire d'Etat, un programme d'enseignement des droits de l'homme dans les universités a été mis en place. Des mesures visant à garantir l'égalité entre les genres dans l'éducation ont aussi été prises. Sur le plan social, il existe en Angola des programmes de réduction des inégalités en faveur des plus vulnérables, notamment par le biais d'un système de transfert de ressources en faveur des familles les plus pauvres, qui a permis à nombre d'entre elles d'ouvrir des entreprises., M. FAISAL MEKDAD, Ministre des affaires étrangères et des expatriés de la République arabe syrienne, a déploré l'insistance des pays occidentaux à exploiter le Conseil et ses mécanismes pour imposer leur [approche faite de] « deux poids, deux mesures » en matière de droits de l'homme, ainsi qu'à accuser les États de bafouer les droits de l'homme et à utiliser ces accusations comme prétexte pour s'immiscer dans leurs affaires intérieures. Le Ministre syrien a espéré que le Conseil mettrait fin au travail des mécanismes politisés qu'il a mis en place sans le consentement de l'État concerné., Depuis 2011, a poursuivi M. Mekdad, la République arabe syrienne est confrontée à une guerre terroriste systématique, menée depuis l'étranger pour saper sa stabilité, son unité et son intégrité territoriale, en plus de l'occupation étrangère de certaines parties de son sol. Ces difficultés sont encore aggravées par l'imposition au peuple syrien de mesures coercitives unilatérales de la part des États-Unis et de l'Union européenne, a ajouté le Ministre. Il a ensuite affirmé que l'État syrien assumait ses responsabilités pour préserver sa souveraineté, libérer son territoire de l'occupation étrangère, combattre les groupes terroristes armés, préserver la sécurité et la vie de ses citoyens et répondre à leurs besoins fondamentaux. Le Ministre syrien des affaires étrangères a souligné que son pays est attaché à un processus politique dirigé et détenu par les Syriens et facilité par les Nations Unies. À la lumière des préparatifs du septième cycle de réunions du Comité constitutionnel syrien qui doit se tenir à Genève, le Ministre a réaffirmé que « le Comité est maître de lui-même et décideur exclusif de sa ligne de conduite et des résultats auxquels il peut parvenir »., MME HELENA MATEUS KIDA, Ministre de la justice, des affaires constitutionnelles et religieuses du Mozambique, a indiqué que son pays s'engageait à s'acquitter au mieux de la mise en œuvre effective non seulement des recommandations formulées dans le cadre de l'EPU, mais aussi des autres recommandations relatives aux droits de l'homme afin de garantir la protection de ses citoyens. A cet effet, la Ministre a énuméré un certain nombre d'actions prises par son Gouvernement, attirant notamment l'attention sur le Plan d'action national pour la mise en œuvre des recommandations issues du troisième cycle de l'EPU (2020-2025)., Mme Kida a affirmé que tous les efforts déployés par le Mozambique ont permis d'ouvrir une nouvelle page dans l'histoire de l'exercice des droits de l'homme et du citoyen dans ce pays. Elle a ajouté que le Mozambique entendait mettre à la disposition des Nations Unies sa modeste et humble expérience en matière de prévention, de médiation et de résolution des conflits par le dialogue. Malgré les efforts décrits, il reste au pays de nombreux défis à relever afin de créer un environnement favorable à l'exercice des droits de l'homme et du citoyen, a admis la Ministre., MME YVONNE DAUSAB, Ministre de la justice de la Namibie, a fait observer que la réunion de ce jour a lieu alors que nombre de pays continuent de subir les affres de la pandémie de COVID-19. En dépit des efforts, le taux de vaccination dans les pays en développement reste très bas, a-t-elle souligné. La Namibie est donc heureuse de noter qu'une partie des discussions de cette session du Conseil sera consacrée à trouver des réponses quant à la manière d'assurer un accès équitable et abordable aux vaccins pour tous les pays., En tant que membre du Conseil, la Namibie participe activement aux travaux de cet organe et elle le fait dans un esprit de coopération avec les États membres et observateurs ainsi qu'avec les importants acteurs non étatiques. Rappelant l'objectif collectif de promouvoir et de protéger les droits de l'homme de tous, sans distinction d'origine, d'ethnie ou de race, la Ministre namibienne de la justice a indiqué que dans ce contexte, son pays est attaché à la pleine mise en œuvre de la Déclaration et du Programme d'action de Durban, qui incarnent les engagements fermes pris par les États pour débarrasser le monde des fléaux du racisme, de la xénophobie et de l'intolérance qui y est associée., La Ministre s'est également exprimée sur les changements qui affectent la Namibie et constituent une « menace sérieuse » pour les générations actuelle et futures. La Namibie s'est donc engagée à atteindre l'objectif de développement durable n°13, s'agissant en particulier de la mise en place de mécanismes d'atténuation des changements climatiques, a-t-elle précisé. Elle a souligné que la Namibie a créé le Fonds d'investissement pour l'environnement afin de superviser la mobilisation et l'utilisation du financement de l'action climatique destiné aux projets verts dans le pays. La Ministre a ensuite évoqué la question des effets négatifs des mesures coercitives unilatérales sur la jouissance de tous les droits de l'homme et a fait savoir que la Namibie demandait une fois de plus aux pays qui les appliquent de lever les « sanctions illégales » imposées à Cuba, à l'Iran, au Venezuela et au Zimbabwe. Il n'y a tout simplement aucune justification pour maintenir ces sanctions qui entravent la capacité des États sanctionnés à promouvoir et protéger efficacement les droits de l'homme, en particulier dans le contexte de la pandémie, a-t-elle plaidé. Par ailleurs, la Namibie appelle la communauté internationale à œuvrer pour réaliser le droit à l'autodétermination du peuple de Palestine et du peuple du Sahara occidental., M. ABDULLATIF BIN RASHID ALZAYANI, Ministre des affaires étrangères de Bahreïn, a indiqué que, face aux guerres et aux conflits qui se poursuivent au Moyen-Orient, Bahreïn soutenait les efforts visant à soutenir la paix dans la région et dans le monde, grâce notamment à la création de mécanismes tels que le Centre mondial du Roi Hamad pour la coexistence pacifique, le Prix Shaikh Isa pour le service à l'humanité, et la Chaire du Roi Hamad pour le dialogue interconfessionnel et la coexistence pacifique à l'Université Sapienza, en Italie. Le Ministre a ensuite décrit les mesures prises par le Gouvernement de Bahreïn pour contrer la pandémie de COVID-19., En ce qui concerne la protection des droits de l'homme, la loi sur les peines et mesures alternatives, adoptée en 2017, constitue une étape pionnière dans le domaine de la réforme et de la réadaptation des personnes condamnées pour des infractions, en les réintégrant dans leur environnement social et leur vie normale. M. Alzayani a ensuite fait valioir les progrès enregistrés par le Royaume de Bahreïn dans les domaines de la lutte contre la traite des personnes et de l'autonomisation des femmes., M. IOANNIS KASOULIDES, Ministre des affaires étrangères de la République de Chypre, a dénoncé la souffrance et la misère engendrées par la guerre et a condamné l'invasion de l'Ukraine par la Fédération de Russie. Il a lancé un appel à la Fédération de Russie pour qu'elle mette immédiatement fin aux hostilités et reprenne la voie de la diplomatie. Il a insisté sur l'importance de tenir un débat d'urgence sur la situation des droits de l'homme en Ukraine, car le dialogue est le seul moyen d'aplanir les différences, a-t-il affirmé., Le Ministre chypriote a ensuite rappelé l'agression étrangère de son pays et l'occupation de ce dernier depuis presque cinquante années et a déclaré que « les conséquences et les violations des droits de l'homme commises par la Turquie depuis 1974 se font encore sentir aujourd'hui » puisque les personnes déplacées de force n'ont toujours pas été autorisées à retourner dans leurs maisons et leurs propriétés. Il a ajouté que les menaces de colonisation de la ville fantôme de Varosha sont en violation des résolutions pertinentes du Conseil de sécurité et de l'ancienne Commission des droits de l'homme. M. Kasoulides a indiqué que Chypre souhaitait devenir membre du Conseil pour la période 2025-2027. Il a en outre rappelé que Chypre était à seulement 60 miles des côtes syriennes et que la Syrie subissait depuis plus d'une décennie des violations des droits de l'homme, les civils sur le terrain continuant de souffrir. Enfin, le Ministre chypriote a estimé qu'il était impératif qu'une nouvelle date soit annoncée pour la tenue des élections reportées en Libye, car – a-t-il affirmé – l'incertitude croissante pourrait dégénérer en violence., M. SERGEY LAVROV, Ministre des affaires étrangères de la Fédération de Russie, a expliqué qu'il avait espéré pouvoir participer en personne aux travaux du Conseil, mais qu'il est finalement contraint de s'adresser au Conseil par vidéo, en raison des « mesures scandaleuses » prises par l'Union européenne pour refuser de respecter l'un des droits humains fondamentaux, à savoir le droit à la liberté de circulation. Selon M. Lavrov, les membres de l'Union européenne ont choisi la voie des sanctions unilatérales « illégitimes », les utilisant pour échapper au « dialogue direct et honnête en face à face qu'ils craignent manifestement »., La situation dans le monde ne s'arrange pas ; elle se détériore sous nos yeux, a poursuivi M. Lavrov. La raison principale en est que les États-Unis et leurs alliés continuent d'imposer de manière agressive au reste de la communauté internationale le « soi-disant ordre mondial fondé sur des règles », a-t-il déclaré. L'exemple de l'Ukraine illustre bien les conséquences de cet « ordre », a-t-il affirmé, expliquant que c'est la politique de « l'Occident collectif dirigé par Washington » qui a conduit « le régime de Kiev » à entrer en guerre contre son propre peuple depuis 2014. M. Lavrov a alors expliqué que les « ultranationalistes et les néonazis » qui ont pris le pouvoir à Kiev lors d'un coup d'État soutenu par l'Occident ont « déclenché une véritable terreur ». Il est impossible, a-t-il dit, de se souvenir sans frémir de la terrible tragédie survenue à Odessa le 2 mai 2014 : des manifestants pacifiques ont été brûlés vifs dans la Maison des syndicats. Les auteurs de cette atrocité sont connus par leurs noms, mais jusqu'à présent ils n'ont pas été punis. Des fosses communes ont également été découvertes, prouvant de manière irréfutable les conséquences criminelles des bombardements massifs de sites civils dans le Donbass, a ajouté le Ministre russe des affaires étrangères. « Le régime ukrainien » a également poursuivi une politique de « dé-russification agressive » et d'assimilation forcée, a-t-il insisté. Toutes ces « attaques massives et systématiques » contre les droits et libertés et l'implantation conséquente du néonazisme sont menées avec la connivence ouverte des États-Unis, du Canada et des pays de l'Union européenne, a affirmé M. Lavrov, avant d'ajouter que récemment, « les actions criminelles du régime ukrainien » se sont intensifiées de manière spectaculaire., Dans ce contexte, a poursuivi le Ministre, la Fédération de Russie ne pouvait rester indifférente au sort des quatre millions de personnes du Donbass. Le Président Poutine a donc décidé de reconnaître les républiques populaires de Donetsk et de Lougansk, en réponse à l'appel des dirigeants de ces entités. Il a aussi décidé de lancer une « opération militaire spéciale » pour protéger leurs habitants, conformément aux traités d'amitié et d'assistance mutuelle conclus avec ces républiques. Le but de notre action est de sauver des personnes, et de « démilitariser et dénazifier l'Ukraine » afin qu'une telle chose ne se reproduise plus jamais. Cela est d'autant plus pertinent que le pays a été entraîné dans l'Organisation du Traité de l'Atlantique Nord (OTAN) et que des armes ont été fournies au « régime actuel », qui a menacé de recourir à la force et d'acquérir une capacité nucléaire militaire, a argumenté le Ministre russe., Répondant à ce qu'il a qualifié de « prétendue violation de la souveraineté et de l'intégrité territoriale de l'Ukraine », M. Lavrov a affirmé que les États-Unis et leurs alliés – qui sont « directement responsables de nombreuses violations des droits de l'homme et du droit humanitaire international, responsables des crimes dont ont été victimes des centaines de milliers de personnes ordinaires en Yougoslavie, en Irak, en Libye et en Afghanistan » – démontrent une fois de plus leur politique de deux poids deux mesures. Le soutien au « régime actuel de Kiev » en est un exemple frappant, a insisté M. Lavrov., En ce qui le concerne, le Président Poutine a souligné à plusieurs reprises que la Fédération de Russie a un respect indéfectible pour le peuple ukrainien, sa langue et ses traditions. Nous n'avons nullement l'intention de porter atteinte aux intérêts des citoyens de l'Ukraine, auxquels nous sommes unis non seulement par une histoire commune, une affinité civilisationnelle, spirituelle et culturelle, mais aussi simplement par des liens de sang et de famille, a déclaré M. Lavrov, avant de rappeler que des millions de natifs d'Ukraine vivent aujourd'hui en Fédération de Russie. L'essentiel est de mettre un terme aux tentatives des pouvoirs temporaires qui se sont illégalement emparés du pouvoir de trahir les intérêts fondamentaux du peuple ukrainien et de mener une politique visant à transformer leur pays en ""anti-Russie"" pour plaire à l'Occident, a indiqué le Ministre russe., Concluant son intervention, M. Lavrov a rappelé qu'à la demande du Président Zelensky, des négociations ont commencé entre les deux pays. « J'espère que la partie ukrainienne est consciente de la gravité de la situation et de sa responsabilité », et qu'elle réalise la nécessité de montrer son autonomie et son pouvoir afin d'éviter une répétition de l'histoire avec les accords de Minsk, a déclaré M. Lavrov. Pour sa part, le rôle du Conseil des droits de l'homme est de garantir l'engagement envers nos valeurs communes et de promouvoir un débat respectueux, sans politisation ni deux poids deux mesures, a-t-il conclu., M. JEPPE KOFOD, Ministre des affaires étrangères du Danemark, a condamné l'agression de l'Ukraine – une nation souveraine – par la Fédération de Russie. Nous voyons des familles séparées, des jardins d'enfants détruits par des obus russes et des explosions dans des immeubles d'habitation ; nous sommes choqués par les attaques indiscriminées contre des civils, a déclaré le Ministre danois, avant d'ajouter que « les générations futures nous jugeront en fonction des décisions que nous prendrons ces prochains jours ». Condamnant ce qu'il a qualifié d' « invasion non provoquée et injustifiée », M. Kofod a estimé que le Conseil a bien agi en convoquant un débat sur la situation en Ukraine. Les droits des Ukrainiens doivent d'être protégés en ligne et hors ligne, y compris contre la désinformation, a-t-il souligné., À l'intérieur même de la Fédération de Russie, a poursuivi le Ministre danois, il est préoccupant de constater les attaques que subissent les droits à la liberté d'expression et de réunion pacifique. M. Kofod a demandé la libération des manifestants pacifiques en Fédération de Russie. Quant au Bélarus, « un régime qui soutient l'agression russe contre l'Ukraine et qui opprime ses propres citoyens », les responsables des violations des droits de l'homme devront répondre de leurs crimes, a ajouté le Ministre., M. Kofod a ensuite demandé que la Haute-Commissaire aux droits de l'homme puisse accéder sans entrave au Xinjiang. Il a en outre fait part des préoccupations de son pays face à la situation des droits de l'homme en Afghanistan et en Éthiopie., M. ALEXANDER SCHALLENBERG, Ministre fédéral des affaires européennes et internationales de la République d'Autriche, a indiqué s'adresser au Conseil à un moment où le monde est sous le choc des événements horribles qui se produisent en Ukraine. Il a souligné que l'invasion de l'Ukraine par les forces armées de la Fédération de Russie n'est pas seulement une attaque contre une autre nation souveraine mais également une attaque contre les aspirations du peuple ukrainien à la liberté et à la démocratie. Il a appelé le Président russe à cesser immédiatement cette guerre insensée. Le révisionnisme historique, la désinformation et l'utilisation de la force militaire au lieu de la diplomatie font ressurgir les démons du passé que nous pensions avoir laissé derrière nous, a-t-il ajouté, précisant que son pays appuyait la tenue d'un débat d'urgence sur cette question., L'an prochain marquera le trentième anniversaire de la Conférence mondiale de Vienne sur les droits de l'homme, alors que les droits de l'homme et l'état de droit sont confrontés à des défis importants, a poursuivi M. Schallenberg. L'Autriche a toujours été et restera un fervent soutien du système international des droits de l'homme, a-t-il assuré. Malheureusement, a souligné le Ministre autrichien, la situation humanitaire dans de nombreux lieux, comme au Bélarus, en Syrie, au Yémen, en Éthiopie, au Myanmar, au Nicaragua et dans bien d'autres endroits, demeure alarmante et requiert notre attention. Ce faisant, nous devons nous assurer que le Conseil traite des situations de pays de manière holistique ; le fait de distinguer un pays ou de se concentrer sur un pays par le biais d'un point particulier de l'ordre du jour tout en négligeant les violations dans d'autres pays a un impact négatif sur le Conseil dans son ensemble, a expliqué le Ministre. Il a ensuite indiqué qu'au cours de cette session, l'Autriche entendait présenter une résolution axée sur les minorités dans les situations de conflit. Il a en outre appelé à la protection des journalistes, des membres de la société civile et des défenseurs des droits de l'homme. Le caractère universel des droits de l'homme n'est pas sujet à négociation et toute tentative de le relativiser ou de le remettre en question est inacceptable, a conclu M. Schallenberg., M. BOGDAN LUCIAN AURESCU, Ministre des affaires étrangères de la Roumanie, a fait observer que l'on assistait, « une nouvelle fois », à une « agression non provoquée » de l'Ukraine par la Fédération de Russie, huit ans après « l'annexion » de la Crimée. Le Conseil a donc le devoir de surveiller cette situation des droits de l'homme et de documenter les violations du droit international humanitaire, dans le contexte d'allégations d'attaques contre des installations civiles, a-t-il souligné. La Roumanie, qui est disposée à accueillir sur son territoire des réfugiés venus d'Ukraine, demande à la Fédération de Russie de cesser immédiatement cette « agression » et de libérer toutes les personnes détenues pour avoir manifesté contre la guerre, a ajouté le Ministre roumain., M. Aurescu a ensuite confirmé la volonté de la Roumanie de se porter candidat pour devenir membre dei Conseil des droits de l'homme pour la période 2023-2025. Il a présenté nombre de mesures prises dans son pays comme témoignage de l'attachement de la Roumanie aux droits de l'homme, s'agissant notamment de l'égalité entre les genres et de la lutte contre le racisme et l'antisémitisme., M. JOSEP BORRELL FONTELLES, Haut-Représentant de l'Union européenne pour les affaires étrangères et la politique de sécurité et Vice-Président de la Commission européenne, a constaté que la Fédération de Russie poursuivait son agression militaire contre l'Ukraine, notamment ses attaques contre des civils. « Il ne s'agit pas seulement d'une attaque contre une Ukraine libre, démocratique et pacifique. C'est une attaque contre la stabilité et la sécurité mondiales, une violation gravissime du droit international ainsi que des principes fondamentaux de la coexistence humaine », a déploré M. Borrell. Il a affirmé que l'Union européenne condamnait « dans les termes les plus forts » l'attaque non provoquée de la Fédération de Russie contre l'Ukraine, et qu'elle soutenait le Gouvernement démocratiquement élu de l'Ukraine et ses efforts pour défendre son territoire et son peuple., M. Borrell a aussi mentionné « d'autres situations où les droits humains fondamentaux sont violés », et d'abord au Bélarus, où plus de mille personnes ont été enfermées parce qu'elles ont « osé protester pacifiquement, alors que les médias indépendants et la société civile sont réprimés ». Le Gouvernement bélarussien est « complice de l'invasion militaire de l'Ukraine par la Russie et devrait en être tenu pour responsable », a dit M. Borrell., Le Haut-Représentant a également mis en garde contre une tentative de la Fédération de Russie, entre autres pays, de remodeler les principes fondamentaux des relations internationales en relativisant les concepts clefs des droits de l'homme et de la démocratie, et en arguant que seuls les États sont souverains, et non les peuples. « Si cette campagne révisionniste réussit, nous courons le risque de revenir à un ordre international où la force sera synonyme de pouvoir », s'est alarmé M. Borrell. L'Union européenne, a-t-il assuré, n'acceptera aucun effort visant à saper les libertés fondamentales ou les obligations internationales existantes en matière de droits de l'homme. Les membres du Conseil des droits de l'homme et du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies doivent respecter la responsabilité et les obligations qui découlent de leur statut de membre, a insisté M. Borrell. « Les actions de la Russie en Ukraine visent à tourner en dérision le multilatéralisme. Le président Poutine a montré son mépris pour le Conseil de sécurité de l'ONU », a-t-il également déclaré. M. Borrell a appelé « tous les membres de l'ONU, grands et petits, à agir avec nous pour défendre les principes et les valeurs de l'ONU et de ce Conseil des droits de l'homme. », MME VELISLAVA PETROVA, Vice-Ministre des affaires étrangères de la Bulgarie, a affirmé que le Conseil des droits de l'homme était un pilier essentiel pour garantir la protection des droits humains et a rappelé l'engagement de son pays en faveur des travaux de cet organe. Nous assistons actuellement à la pire crise humanitaire et militaire, qui se déploie en Europe et qui jette à bas les principes de l'ordre multilatéral, a-t-elle poursuivi, rappelant que les conflits armés sont une menace pour la jouissance des droits humains et que le conflit en Ukraine ne fait à cet égard pas exception. La Bulgarie appuie la souveraineté et l'intégrité territoriale de l'Ukraine et exhorte la Fédération de Russie à cesser les hostilités et à respecter ses obligations en matière de droit international, a déclaré Mme Petrova. Elle a dénoncé les conséquences négatives de l'invasion russe en Ukraine et ses effets sur la situation humanitaire dans le pays et autour. Elle a appuyé la tenue au Conseil d'un débat sur la situation actuelle en Ukraine et a demandé au Conseil de poursuivre ses travaux pour la résolution de cette question., Enfin, la Vice-Ministre bulgare des affaires étrangères a indiqué que son pays souhaitait soumettre à nouveau sa candidature pour être membre du Conseil pour la période 2024-2026. Afin de témoigner des engagements de son pays en faveur des questions relatives aux droits humains, elle a notamment cité les avancées de la Bulgarie en matière de lutte contre le racisme et la discrimination, de protection des enfants, d'autonomisation des femmes, ou encore en ce qui concerne les droits des personnes handicapées et vulnérables., M. CHOI JONGMOON, Vice-Ministre des affaires étrangères de la République de Corée, a fermement condamné l'agression de l'Ukraine par la Fédération de Russie, justifiant ainsi son vote en faveur de la tenue d'un débat urgent du Conseil des droits de l'homme sur le sujet. Il a ensuite appelé le Conseil des droits de l'homme à continuer de suivre la situation des droits de l'homme au Myanmar, un an après la prise de pouvoir par les militaires., S'agissant de la République populaire démocratique de Corée, le Vice-Ministre a affirmé que la communauté internationale devait continuer de travailler avec elle afin de l'aider à répondre aux besoins de sa population. En retour, celle-ci doit répondre aux préoccupations de la communauté internationale, portant notamment sur les personnes disparues et la réunification des familles. Le Vice-Ministre des affaires étrangères de la République de Corée a en outre jugé important de continuer à rendre hommage aux femmes de réconfort., M. FRANCISCO ANDRÉ, Secrétaire d'État aux affaires étrangères et à la coopération du Portugal, a déploré un « moment bien triste, le plus sombre depuis la Deuxième Guerre mondiale » et dont l'impact sera grave. Le Portugal est solidaire avec le peuple ukrainien et accueillera les Ukrainiens qui ont besoin d'un lieu pour continuer à vivre, a-t-il assuré. Il a demandé à la Fédération de Russie de mettre fin à cette invasion [de l'Ukraine] et de revenir à la table des négociations., Le Secrétaire d'État a d'autre part félicité les Nations Unies pour leur engagement de tous les instants en faveur des droits de l'homme pendant la pandémie de COVID-19. Le Portugal aide les petits États insulaires en développement et les pays les moins avancés par le biais de livraisons de matériel et de sa participation au mécanisme COVAX de l'OMS, a souligné M. André. Il a insisté sur l'importance de respecter l'ensemble des droits de l'homme, seule garantie de parvenir au droit au développement., MME ELIZABETH TRUSS, Secrétaire d'État aux affaires étrangères, du Commonwealth et de développement du Royaume-Uni de Grande-Bretagne et d'Irlande du Nord, a estimé qu'il était du devoir moral du Conseil de s'opposer aux agressions, notamment lorsqu'elles proviennent de ses membres. Elle s'est dite préoccupée par les rapports faisant état de violations des droits de l'homme en Chine, plus particulièrement au Xinjiang et au Tibet, et dans d'autres parties du monde comme en Afghanistan et au Myanmar. Mais c'est surtout sur l'invasion illégale et non provoquée de la Fédération de Russie en Ukraine que la Secrétaire d'État a dit souhaiter orienter son propos, estimant que Vladimir Poutine avait du sang sur les mains – non seulement celui d'Ukrainiens innocents mais aussi celui des hommes qu'il a envoyés à la mort. M. Poutine est responsable des pertes civiles et de la fuite de plus de 500 000 personnes, a-t-elle insisté. Il s'agit de la guerre du Président Poutine contre une nation souveraine, a déclaré Mme Truss, avant de demander instamment aux nations de condamner les actions effroyables de la Fédération de Russie et d'isoler ce pays sur la scène internationale., Le Royaume-Uni, a poursuivi Mme Truss, a été la première nation européenne à appuyer économiquement l'Ukraine, à lui envoyer des armes défensives et à soutenir l'aide humanitaire. La Secrétaire d'Etat a rappelé les sanctions d'ores et déjà prises à l'encontre de la Fédération de Russie et notamment à l'encontre de la grande majorité de ses banques désormais exclues du système financier mondial : nous avons l'intention de faire pression sur le régime de Poutine en renforçant nos sanctions, a-t-elle ajouté. Elle a par ailleurs rappelé les précédents abus de la Fédération de Russie, tels que l'annexion illégale de la Crimée, l'atteinte à l'intégrité territoriale de la Géorgie ou encore sa responsabilité dans les violations généralisées en Syrie, évoquant en outre les allégations de détention arbitraire, de brutalités, de torture et de suppression des libertés dans son propre pays qui pèsent sur le « régime de Poutine ». Mme Truss a appelé les membres du Conseil à faire entendre leur voix, à s'opposer à l'agression russe et à soutenir le peuple ukrainien., Ce document produit par le Service de l'information des Nations Unies à Genève est destiné à l'information; il ne constitue pas un document officiel., Les versions anglaise et française de nos communiqués sont différentes car elles sont le produit de deux équipes de couverture distinctes qui travaillent indépendamment.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/le-ministre-russe-des-affaires-trang-res-s-adresse-au-conseil-des-droits-de-l-homme-o

IAEA Director General's Introductory Statement to the Board of Governors (2 March 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,2 Mar 2022,"(As prepared for delivery), Mr Chairperson,, We are meeting today to discuss the nuclear safety, security and safeguards implications of the conflict in Ukraine as a result of the Russian Federation’s military operation that began on 24 February., The situation in Ukraine is unprecedented and I continue to be gravely concerned. It is the first time a military conflict is happening amidst the facilities of a large, established nuclear power programme, which in this case also include the site of the 1986 accident at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant., The safety and security of nuclear facilities, and nuclear and other radioactive material, in Ukraine must under no circumstances be endangered., I have called for restraint from all measures or actions that could jeopardize the security of nuclear and other radioactive material, and the safe operation of any nuclear facilities in Ukraine, because any such incident could have severe consequences, aggravating human suffering and causing environmental harm., In this context it is also imperative to ensure that the brave people who operate, regulate, inspect and assess the nuclear facilities in Ukraine can continue to do their indispensable jobs safely, unimpeded and without undue pressure., From the beginning of the conflict, the IAEA has been monitoring the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. Through the IAEA’s Incident and Emergency Centre (IEC), we have been receiving updates from our counterpart at the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU), allowing us to publish regular updates on our website., Despite the extraordinary circumstances of an armed conflict causing increasing challenges and dangers, Ukraine’s Nuclear Power Plants are operating normally., But while we may use expressions like “normal operations” in a technical context, I want to emphasise there is nothing normal about the circumstances under which the professionals at Ukraine’s four Nuclear Power Plants are managing to keep the reactors that produce half of Ukraine’s electricity working., Russia informed us yesterday that its military forces have taken control of the territory around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine’s largest Nuclear Power Plant, which houses six of the country’s 15 operational nuclear power reactors., It is of critical importance that the armed conflict and activities on the ground around Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant and any other of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities in no way interrupts or endangers the facilities or the people working at and around them., Russian forces have taken control of all facilities of the State Specialized Enterprise Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, located within the Exclusion Zone. No casualties or destruction at the industrial site were reported. While increased levels of radiation were initially measured at the site, likely due to the movement of heavy military vehicles disturbing the soil, the IAEA assessed that they remained low enough not to pose a hazard to the public., It is of utmost importance that the staff working at the Specialized Enterprise Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant are able to do their job safely and effectively, and that their personal wellbeing is guaranteed by those who have taken control., Yesterday, I received a letter from the SNRIU requesting me to extend immediate assistance to ensure the safety of the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant and other nuclear facilities in the country. I am conducting consultations in order to address this request for assistance., Mr Chairperson,, On Sunday, the SNRIU informed the Agency that Russian missiles had hit the site of a radioactive waste disposal facility in Kyiv overnight. There were no reports of damage to the building or any indications of a radioactive release., The strike came a day after the regulator said an electrical transformer at a similar disposal facility near the north-eastern city of Kharkiv had been damaged, also without any reports of a radioactive release. Such facilities typically hold disused radioactive sources and other low-level waste from hospitals and industry., The two incidents highlight the risk that facilities with radioactive material may suffer damage during the armed conflict, with potentially severe consequences., In this context, it is necessary and urgent to renew an appeal to all States, without exception, to reaffirm their commitment to upholding international law and to fulfilling the obligation they agreed to when the IAEA General Conference unanimously adopted a decision in 2009 to reaffirm resolutions adopted in 1985 and 1990, stating that “any armed attack on and threat against nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes constitutes a violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter, international law and the Statute of the Agency”., Today, this commitment acquires a sense of profound moral significance., Mr Chairperson,, A nuclear accident can have a serious impact beyond the borders of the country in which it occurs and the world is relying on the IAEA to keep it informed with accurate and timely information., A key source of information for the IAEA is the Ukrainian regulator. Ukraine’s ability to provide accurate and complete data on the safety and security of the operation of all nuclear facilities in Ukraine should not be interrupted, impeded or influenced., This is particularly critical during an armed conflict, which heightens the risk of nuclear accidents, and makes the response more difficult., At the heart of nuclear safety are the three main safety functions: Containment, Control and Cooling. In concrete terms, that means:, Mr Chairperson,, So far, I have described the Agency’s monitoring of the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear sites. As regards safeguards, let me inform you that safeguards in Ukraine are under the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and the Additional Protocol of Ukraine, and that the Agency’s safeguards activities are ongoing., I will continue to keep the Board apprised of the Agency’s fulfilment of its mandate with regards to nuclear safety, security and safeguards in Ukraine., The IAEA’s unique mandate makes it the sole independent international technical organisation providing regular updates on the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. At a time of great uncertainty, this aspect of the IAEA’s work is indispensable., Ladies and gentlemen,, Let me end by saying this: the best action to ensure the safety and security of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and its people would be for this armed conflict to end now., Thank you",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iaea-director-generals-introductory-statement-board-governors-2-march-2022

Protection and Human Rights",2 Mar 2022,"SG/SM/21163
2 MARCH 2022, Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the press following the General Assembly vote on Ukraine, in New York today:, The General Assembly has spoken. As Secretary-General, it is my duty to stand by this resolution and be guided by its call. The message of the General Assembly is loud and clear: end hostilities in Ukraine — now; silence the guns — now; open the door to dialogue and diplomacy — now., The territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine must be respected in line with the United Nations Charter. We don’t have a moment to lose. The brutal effects of the conflict are plain to see. But, as bad as the situation is for the people in Ukraine right now, it threatens to get much, much worse., The ticking clock is a time bomb. I am also deeply concerned with its potential consequences for regional and global peace and security, and a world struggling to recover from COVID. Today’s resolution reflects a central truth. The world wants an end to the tremendous human suffering in Ukraine., This same truth was clear in the rapid mobilization of funds for our life-saving humanitarian operations in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. Our global flash appeal was met with record generosity. I am deeply grateful to donors for their support., With that funding in hand, we’ll be able to scale up the delivery of vital medical and health supplies, food, safe drinking water, shelter and protection. Looking ahead, I will continue to do everything in my power to contribute to an immediate cessation of hostilities and urgent negotiations for peace., People in Ukraine desperately need peace. And people around the world demand it., For information media.

UE : Maintenir l’ouverture des frontières pour les personnes fuyant l’Ukraine,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,1 Mar 2022,"Il faut assurer la sécurité et la protection des réfugiés ukrainiens ainsi que des ressortissants étrangers, (Bruxelles, le 1er mars 2022) – L’Union européenne et ses États membres devraient tout mettre en œuvre pour garantir un passage sûr à tous les civils fuyant l’Ukraine, en les traitant de manière égalitaire, a déclaré aujourd’hui Human Rights Watch. Les ministres européens de la Justice et des Affaires intérieures, qui se réuniront les 3 et 4 mars 2022, devraient approuver un plan d’action concerté prévoyant des mesures visant à garantir l’accès au territoire, la protection et le soutien de tous les réfugiés de guerre., « Nous avons assisté à une démonstration rapide et encourageante de solidarité avec les Ukrainiens, et saluons la volonté de l’UE de rationaliser l’accès à un sanctuaire par le biais de la directive européenne relative à la protection temporaire », a déclaré Judith Sunderland, directrice adjointe de la division Europe et Asie centrale à Human Rights Watch. « Il est d’une importance vitale que tous les États membres et institutions de l’UE aident toutes ces personnes, y compris celles qui ne sont pas ukrainiennes, à se mettre en sécurité et à obtenir les soins, la protection et l’assistance dont elles ont besoin. », Des centaines de milliers de personnes ont fui leurs foyers en Ukraine depuis le début de l’invasion russe, le 24 février. Selon le Haut-Commissariat des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés (HCR), au 28 février, plus de 500 000 personnes avaient fui vers les pays voisins et 100 000 étaient déplacées à l’intérieur de l’Ukraine. Le HCR a demandé à tous les pays d’accueil d’accueillir toutes les personnes fuyant le conflit et l’insécurité en Ukraine « indépendamment de leur nationalité et de leur race »., Human Rights Watch et d’autres organisations ont documenté de graves violations des lois de la guerre par les forces russes, notamment l’utilisation d’armes à sous-munitions, qui ont touché un hôpital et une école maternelle. Selon l’ONU, le nombre de victimes civiles des quatre premiers jours du conflit est de 406, dont 102 morts., Les pays de l’UE voisins de l’Ukraine – la Pologne, la Hongrie, la Slovaquie et la Roumanie – ne devraient pas avoir à assumer l’entière responsabilité d’accueillir les réfugiés ukrainiens. Des dispositions devraient être prises pour garantir une répartition équitable de cet afflux par tous les États membres, notamment par le biais d’un plan de réinstallation efficace et équitable qui tienne compte des liens familiaux et, dans la mesure du possible, des préférences individuelles., Il est d’une importance vitale pour tous les pays voisins de l’Ukraine de permettre à chacun d’entrer en réduisant au minimum les procédures bureaucratiques. Les personnes ayant des amis ou de la famille qui peuvent les accueillir devraient être autorisées à se rendre chez eux, et celles qui ont besoin d’un hébergement avoir accès à un logement digne et adéquat. Les services essentiels tels que les soins de santé, y compris les soins de santé mentale, et les services de soutien aux enfants devraient être mis à disposition pour qu’ils puissent reprendre leur scolarité le plus rapidement possible., Ces conditions devraient s’appliquer de façon identique aux Ukrainiens et aux non-Ukrainiens fuyant le conflit, a relevé Human Rights Watch. Les États membres et les institutions de l’UE devraient préciser aux autorités ukrainiennes qu’ils accepteront tous les civils en provenance d’Ukraine, sans distinction, et œuvrer activement avec les autorités ukrainiennes à ce qu’ils puissent exercer leur droit de partir sans retard inutile et à faciliter leur transit et leur accès au territoire de l’UE., Human Rights Watch s’est entretenu avec des ressortissants étrangers qui ont déclaré que les autorités ukrainiennes les avaient empêchés de monter dans les trains d’évacuation ou d’atteindre la frontière pour laisser place aux femmes et aux enfants ukrainiens. L’Union africaine a publié le 28 février une déclaration exhortant « tous les pays à respecter le droit international et à faire preuve de la même empathie et du même soutien à l’égard de toutes les personnes fuyant la guerre, quelle que soit leur identité raciale ». Il a également été signalé que certains ressortissants étrangers se heurtent à des problèmes aux frontières de l’UE. Le 1er mars, le HCR, tout en félicitant les pays voisins d’avoir gardé leurs frontières ouvertes, a déclaré être « conscient des difficultés rencontrées par certains ressortissants de pays tiers cherchant à gagner la Pologne »., La décision attendue d’invoquer la directive sur la protection temporaire est positive, reconnaît Human Rights Watch. Ce serait la première fois que l’UE recourt à cette directive, adoptée en 2001 à la suite des flux de réfugiés déclenchés par la guerre en ex-Yougoslavie. Elle permettrait d’accorder une protection globale et simplifiée, pour une durée maximale de trois ans, aux personnes déplacées par la guerre en Ukraine et empêchées de retourner dans leur pays d’origine. Les États membres et institutions de l’UE devraient veiller à ce que les non-Ukrainiens se trouvant dans une situation similaire bénéficient de la même protection et des mêmes droits, et à ce que tous les ressortissants étrangers quittant l’Ukraine puissent accéder au territoire de l’UE, dans le respect de leurs droits et de leur dignité. Ceux qui souhaitent retourner dans leur pays d’origine devraient recevoir une aide appropriée à cette fin., Les États membres de l’UE devraient également protéger le statut des Ukrainiens se trouvant déjà sur leur territoire. Parmi eux, figurent les travailleurs migrants munis de visas de travail temporaires ainsi que les Ukrainiens dont le retour dans leur pays d’origine est prévu. Tout ressortissant ukrainien détenu en l’attente de son expulsion devrait être remis en liberté. Tous les États membres de l’UE qui avaient préalablement désigné l’Ukraine comme « pays sûr » aux fins de retour devraient amender ce statut pour qu’il reflète le changement spectaculaire de la situation., « Il s’agit d’un moment historique pour l’Europe et d’une occasion pour l’UE de remédier aux erreurs du passé et de se montrer à la hauteur de la situation en faisant preuve d’une compassion et d’une solidarité exemplaires », a conclu Judith Sunderland. « Cela exige un engagement véritablement collectif à garder ouverte la porte, mais aussi nos cœurs, à tous ceux qui fuient l’Ukraine. »",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ue-maintenir-l-ouverture-des-fronti-res-pour-les-personnes-fuyant-l-ukraine
"General Assembly overwhelmingly adopts resolution demanding Russian Federation immediately end illegal use of force in Ukraine, withdraw all troops",News and Press Release,UN GA,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",2 Mar 2022,"ELEVENTH EMERGENCY SPECIAL SESSION, 5TH & 6TH MEETINGS (AM & PM), GA/12407
2 MARCH 2022, Member States today overwhelmingly adopted a resolution demanding the Russian Federation immediately end its invasion of Ukraine and unconditionally withdraw all its military forces from that neighbouring country, as the General Assembly continued its emergency session on the crisis., [The emergency special session — the eleventh called since the founding of the United Nations — opened on 28 February, meeting less than 24 hours after being mandated to do so by a vote in the Security Council, following its failure to adopt a resolution condemning the Russian Federation’s recent actions in Ukraine. See Press Releases SC/14808 and SC/14809 for details.], Deploring in the strongest terms its aggression against Ukraine in violation of the Charter of the United Nations, the Assembly also demanded the Russian Federation immediately and unconditionally reverse its 21 February decision related to the status of certain areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine., The measure was adopted by a vote of 141 in favour to 5 against (Belarus, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Eritrea, Russian Federation, and Syria) with 35 abstentions — a clear reaffirmation of the 193-member world body’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity., The Assembly demanded that the Russian Federation immediately cease its unlawful use of force against Ukraine and refrain from any further threat or use of force against any United Nations Member State, while also deploring Belarus’ involvement in this illegal action and calling on that country to abide by its international obligations., The text urged the immediate peaceful resolution of the conflict through political dialogue, negotiations, mediation and other peaceful means, calling upon the parties to abide by the Minsk agreements and to work constructively in relevant international frameworks, including the Normandy Format and Trilateral Contact Group, towards their full implementation., On the humanitarian front, the Assembly demanded that all parties allow safe and unfettered passage to destinations outside of Ukraine, facilitate rapid and unhindered access to those in need of assistance inside the country, and protect civilians and medical and humanitarian workers. It further demanded that all parties fully comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law to spare the civilian population and civilian objects, condemning all violations in that regard and asking the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator to provide a report on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and on the humanitarian response within 30 days., Ukraine’s representative, who introduced the resolution, said that for almost a week, his country has been fighting missiles and bombs. Half a million people have fled as the Russian Federation tries to deprive his country of the right to exist, carrying out a long list of war crimes. The Russian Federation’s goal is not just an occupation, it is genocide. “Evil needs more and more space to conquer” if tolerated, he said, adding that the current text is a building block for putting an end to evil., The speaker for the Russian Federation, rebuking those claims, said: “This document will not allow us to end military activities. On the contrary, it could embolden Kiev radicals and nationalists to continue to determine the policy of their country at any price.” Nationalist battalions are planning provocations with the participation of civilians that would then accuse his country of having carried them out. Affirming that the Russian Federation will not conduct strikes against civilian facilities or civilians, he asked the international community to not believe “the large number of fakes spread around the Internet”., Likewise, Syria’s representative said the draft clearly represents a prejudiced attitude based on political propaganda fuelled by political pressure. Language against the Russian Federation attempts to belittle its right to protect its people and its security concerns. Had the United States and its Western allies been serious, they would have fulfilled the promises made decades ago to refrain from transforming Ukraine into a threat to the Russian Federation and should have stopped Ukraine from not complying with the Minsk agreements., The speaker for the United States, who urged countries to vote in favour of the draft, said her country is choosing to stand with the Ukrainian people and will hold the Russian Federation accountable for its actions. Despite Ukraine’s courageous defence, the country has suffered devastating consequences, with up to a million people expected to flee their homes. The international community must welcome them, she said, calling on the Russian Federation to stop its unprovoked war and on Belarus to stop allowing its territory to be used to facilitate that aggression., The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, added: “This is not just about Ukraine, this is not just about Europe, this is about defending an international order based on rules. This is about whether we choose tanks and missiles or dialogue and diplomacy.” Today's historic vote clearly shows the Russian Federation’s isolation from the rest of the international community, he stressed., Turkey’s delegate expressed concern about the illegal act of aggression against a founding member of the United Nations “by a permanent member of the very organ entrusted with preserving peace and security”. It is still not too late to go back to the negotiating table, he said, adding that “as a neighbor and friend of both the Russian and Ukrainian people”, Turkey stands ready to support the peace process., Also participating in the debate were the representatives of Solomon Islands, Myanmar, Pakistan, Djibouti, Bhutan, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Cambodia and Azerbaijan, as well as the Permanent Observers of the Holy See and the Sovereign Order of Malta, and a representative of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance., Statements, NOEL MARTIN MATEA (Solomon Islands), stressing that the Russian Federation’s intervention in Ukraine is a violation of the rule of law, called for immediate de-escalation and restoration of Ukraine’s independence and territorial integrity. Welcoming the talks currently taking place, he stressed the need for diplomacy and dialogue instead of confrontation and hostile postures. The Charter of the United Nations calls for “the open hands of friendship” and not clenched fists, he said. The people of his country know the consequences a world war can bring, he said, underscoring that the world must not go through such brutality ever again. The international community is already inundated with global challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and sea level rise, he noted, pointing out that the situation in Ukraine is diverting much-needed attention from the global development agenda., KYAW MOE TUN (Myanmar) condemned the invasion of Ukraine and the unprovoked attack against its people, calling for respect for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Noting that his country has been following with great concern the situation on the ground in Ukraine, he expressed regret that it had escalated, with intensified attacks by the Russian Federation. Myanmar understands and shares the suffering of the people of Ukraine, he said, noting that they are facing similar suffering because of atrocities committed by the Myanmar military. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced, including those with disabilities, elderly women and children. He commended the neighboring countries of Ukraine, which have opened their borders. “It is time for all of us to stand with justice and with the principles of the United Nations Charter,” he said. Myanmar stands in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and has co-sponsored the draft resolution and will vote in favour of it., MUNIR AKRAM (Pakistan), expressing commitment to self-determination, non-use of force or threat of force and peaceful settlement of disputes, said these principles must be consistently and universally applied. The recent turn of events reflect a failure of diplomacy, he said, calling for sustained dialogue in order to avoid further escalation. Military and political tensions pose an unprecedented threat to global security and economic stability, he said, pointing out that developing countries are the hardest hit by conflict anywhere. Expressing hope that the talks initiated by the Russian Federation and Ukraine will bring about a cessation of hostilities, he voiced concern about the safety of his country’s students and citizens in Ukraine. Those who remain will be evacuated soon, he said, acknowledging the cooperation of Ukrainian authorities and those of neighbouring countries, MOHAMED SIAD DOUALEH (Djibouti), noting the unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, expressed deep regret that the Council failed to act in unison after the veto cast by the Russian Federation. “The refusal expressed by a majority of Member States to be paralyzed into inaction is a testament to the commitment of Member States to ensure that the United Nations remains relevant in the face of vexing and complex security challenges,” he said. Unequivocally condemning the egregious breach of international law and most fundamental Charter principles, he urged that a country, if it has legitimate security concerns, prioritize the use of Charter tools. He reiterated the African Union’s call to establish immediately a ceasefire and to start negotiations without delay under United Nations auspices, stressing that no argument or pretext can justify the use of force and brutal violence unleashed on Ukraine and its people. In that regard, Djibouti will vote in favour of the draft, reaffirming its solidarity with the people of Ukraine. He expressed alarm at the persistent “representations of negativity” towards Africans and statements by so-called experts who are drawing distinctions between refugees fleeing conflict in the Middle East and those fleeing conflict in Ukraine, stressing that wars are the same wherever they are. “We are at a critical moment in the history of the United Nations and must put an end to conflict and do everything to prevent other conflicts. It is within our reach […] let us mobilize our political will to put an end to them,” he said., DOMA TSHERING (Bhutan), noting the significance of the current emergency session, said the provisions of the “Uniting for Peace” resolution must be invoked for the first time in 40 years due to the deadlock in the Security Council. “Perched atop the Himalayas, even the folds of the mighty mountains cannot shield our country from the reverberations of this conflict,” she said, adding that international security is in danger far beyond the borders of Europe. Whereas all Member States are beholden to the principles of the Charter, for small States such as Bhutan, they are the guarantor of peaceful existence and good-neighbourly relations, she said. The threat or use of force against a sovereign State is unacceptable, she emphasized, declaring: “We cannot condone the unilateral drawing of international borders.”, ANOUPARB VONGNORKEO (Lao People’s Democratic Republic) said his country has previously suffered the scourge of war and knows only too well the endless negative consequences it causes to innocent lives. While commending the United Nations and Member States that have offered humanitarian assistance to the affected people, he emphasized that his country remains sceptical of unilateral sanctions, cautioning that such measures could entail long-term impacts on innocent people, including the global community at large, especially during the pandemic. In that regard, he called upon all parties concerned to refrain from any action that could further fuel the escalation of tension, seek peaceful solutions, and restore peace and security. Expressing support for the ongoing effort to find a peaceful diplomatic settlement, he stressed the importance of taking into account the legitimate security concerns of all parties. “It is our fervent hope that, through this diplomatic effort, peace can be restored, peace which constitutes the heart and soul of our Organization, the United Nations,” he said., SOVANN KE (Cambodia), expressing great concern about the human suffering unfolding in Ukraine, emphasized the importance of peaceful dialogue and negotiation. He also stressed the need to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance, reiterating the call by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) for peaceful resolution of the current dispute. Cambodia is a co-sponsor of the draft resolution, he noted., YASHAR T. ALIYEV (Azerbaijan) expressed deep regret that the ongoing crisis has caused significant casualties, among the civilian population in particular. Calling for strict adherence to international humanitarian law, he emphasized that civilian lives and infrastructure must be protected and safeguarded at all times. The evolving humanitarian crisis on the ground requires expedient measures to alleviate the impact of the current situation on civilians, he noted. In that regard, Azerbaijan has rendered, on a bilateral basis, humanitarian assistance in the form of medicine and medical equipment as well as other needs essential to the people of Ukraine. The situation must be settled through diplomatic means, in full compliance with international law, he stressed, reiterating calls for dialogue without delay to prevent further escalation and direct negotiations between the parties., VALENTIN RYBAKOV (Belarus), noting that his country will vote against the draft resolution, said the international community must bear its share of responsibility for what is currently happening in Ukraine. Recalling the signing of the Minsk agreements eight years ago as well as the relevant resolutions adopted by the Council and the Assembly, he said the international community was unable to convince the Ukrainian authorities to abide by these documents. Ukraine has found itself in a state of civil war for years and civilians have been dying in the Donetsk and Luhansk provinces. Noting that operative paragraph 8 of the draft text hypocritically calls on all parties to fulfil the Minsk agreements, he asked its sponsors where they had been for the past eight years., The United States, Canada and the European Union, who believe themselves to be the gold standards of democracy, could not find the strength to respond to the criminal activities of the Ukrainian authorities, he said. Their double standards have already led to hundreds of thousands of victims in the former Yugoslavia as well as Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan. “I will let you in on a secret. Yes, we are involved,” in the conflict, he said, adding that the President of Belarus is sparing no effort to organize negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Cautioning against the imposition of sanctions, for example, against Belarussian potassium fertilizers, he said that will lead to economic and social problems and increased hunger in countries located hundreds of kilometres from his. “Russians and Belarussians are essentially being held hostage” in Ukraine, he said, also highlighting the cases of racism and discrimination towards foreign citizens at the borders as well as the “rampant plundering” and uncontrolled distribution of weapons in Ukraine., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) called on the Russian Federation to stop its unprovoked, unjustified, and unconscionable war, and to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and on Belarus to stop supporting the war and stop allowing its territory to be used to facilitate that aggression. The international community stands together in holding the Russian Federation accountable for its violations of international law and to address the unfolding horrific human rights and humanitarian crisis. She noted that this is the first time in 40 years that the Security Council has convened an emergency special session of the General Assembly, recalling the invasion that caused a war so horrific that it spurred the United Nations into existence. “If the United Nations has any purpose, it is to prevent war, to condemn war, to stop war. That is our job here today. It is the job you were sent here to do not just by your capitals but by all of humanity,” she said., Although Ukraine has defended itself with great courage and vigor, the brazen and indiscriminate nature of the Russian Federation’s attack has had devastating and horrific consequences for the entire country. Detailing acts of aggression that have caused many to flee their homes, she said the latest United Nations estimates are marching towards a million people. She thanked countries for opening their borders, hearts and homes to those fleeing Ukraine and called on the international community to welcome all those fleeing conflict without regard to race or nationality. Pointing to protests for peace that have sprung up around the world in solidarity with Ukraine, she said the United States is choosing to stand with the Ukrainian people, and, in coordination with its allies and partners, to impose severe consequences and hold the Russian Federation accountable for its actions, urging Member States to vote in favour of the resolution., GABRIELE CACCIA, Permanent Observer of the Holy See, echoing calls to end the violence, said the United Nations was founded to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours. It is the duty of all States to seek to resolve disputes through negotiation, mediation or by other peaceful means, even when war has commenced. Expressing appreciation to States which are offering humanitarian assistance to those in need both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries in which many have sought safety, he said Pope Francis has called on believers and non-believers alike to observe this 2 March as a “day to be close to the sufferings of the Ukrainian people, to feel that we are all brothers and sisters, and to implore of God the end of the war”. There is always time for goodwill, still room for negotiation and still a place for the exercise of a wisdom that can prevent the predominance of partisan interest, safeguard the legitimate aspirations of everyone and spare the world from the folly and horrors of war, he said, stressing: “may this Emergency Special Session advance efforts that help attain this end”., PAUL BERESFORD-HILL, Permanent Observer of the Sovereign Order of Malta, highlighting his organization’s mission to serve the sick and the poor, expressed sadness about the ongoing conflict which has impacted the lives of so many citizens of Ukraine and has created an unprecedented flow of refugees. The Sovereign Order’s embassy to Ukraine has provided considerable support and material help to that country’s citizens residents, he said, adding that a refugee exodus of over 6 million persons might be the outcome of this situation. Noting that some nations have gone out of their way to welcome these individuals and to help them through the trauma, he said the Order’s staff are working along the Ukrainian border, doing everything from serving hot food and drink to caring for injured people., AMANDA SOUREK, a representative of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, strongly condemned the unprovoked war of aggression waged by the Russian Federation with Belarus’ involvement against Ukraine. She called on the international community to “spring into action” to protect the people of Ukraine and mitigate the invasion’s humanitarian consequences. Ukraine has successfully reached democratic standards over the past two decades. As such, this is a pivotal moment for democrats all over the world to stand in support of Ukraine, as well as the moment to counter and prevent the rise of authoritarian regimes elsewhere. She called on the Russian Federation to immediately withdraw its military forces and fully respect Ukraine’s sovereignty. She encouraged the Secretary-General to make use of his good offices to advance ceasefire talks, humanitarian access to the war-affected areas, and the protection of civilians. She urged Member States to adopt and enforce sanctions against the Russian Federation until withdrawal of the forces from Ukraine and the restoration of its territorial integrity, and to “do whatever it takes in compliance with the principles of the Charter” to stop the war and prevent any further escalation of conflict. Her Institute and its member States will do their part in collaboration with the United Nations and other democratic Governments and organizations to protect the principle that every country has the right to freely determine its own fate based on the freely expressed will of its people., Action, The representative of Ukraine, introducing the draft resolution titled “Aggression against Ukraine” (document A/ES-11/L.1), said the United Nations was created to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, but it falls to the current generation to save the world yet again from war. Regardless of a nation’s grievances, aggressive warfare is never a solution, he said. For almost a week, his country has been fighting missiles and bombs, he said, adding that the Russian Federation is trying to deprive Ukraine of the right to exist. Expressing gratitude for all expressions of support and solidarity and thanking those Member States who accepted Ukrainian refugees, he said that half a million have fled his country. The list of the Russian Federation’s war crimes is very long, he said, pointing to widespread use of indiscriminate weapons such as aerial bombs in residential areas. Many cities and towns have faced sustained shelling that killed civilians, including children and a student from India. Also noting that a missile was dropped on a holocaust memorial, he said, “What an irony.”, The Russian Federation’s goal is not just an occupation, it is genocide, he said, adding that later this month, the International Court of Justice will hold public hearings concerning allegations of genocide against that country. “Evil needs more and more space to conquer” if tolerated, he said, adding that the current text is a building block for putting an end to evil. Voting in favor of the resolution is a reaffirmation of the Charter, he said, inviting delegates to also sign a copy of the Charter after the vote. Playing a video recording of Benjamin Ferencz, he said this “fragile gentleman” was an investigator of war crimes and a chief prosecutor at the trials of Nuremberg. Echoing Mr. Ferencz’s call for law over war, he called on all Member States to support the draft., The representative of the Russian Federation, calling on Member States to not support the draft resolution, said his country knows of the unprecedented pressure that Western partners are exerting on a large number of countries. “This document will not allow us to end military activities. On the contrary, it could embolden Kiev radicals and nationalists to continue to determine the policy of their country at any price,” he cautioned. The Russian Federation is aware that nationalist battalions are planning provocations with the participation of civilians that would then accuse his country of having carried them out. In addition, military hardware are being placed in residential areas, as well as rocket launchers and artillery, he said, adding that the Russian Federation would provide examples to the United Nations leadership in that regard. “The refusal to support the draft resolution is a vote for a peaceful Ukraine that is free from radicalism and neo-Nazism, living in peace with its neighbors,” he said., That is the aim of the Russian Federation’s special military operation, which has been presented as aggression by the resolution’s sponsors, he continued. Affirming that his country will not carry out strikes against civilian facilities or civilians, he asked the international community to not believe “the large number of fakes spread around the Internet”. He noted that the draft does not mention the “illegal coup in Kiev in February 2014 with the connivance of Germany, France and Poland and with the support of the United States, where the legitimately elected president of their country was overthrown”. The draft also does not mention new nationalist authorities that are limiting the rights of citizens to use the Russian language, he said, adding that that was a stark green light for a chain of events and violations of the basic rights of those living in the east of the country. “This draft is a clear attempt of those who over the last decades have committed huge numbers of aggressions — illegal under international law, as well as coups, one of which was the Maidan coup in Ukraine — and who present themselves as champions of international law,” he said in conclusion., The representative of Serbia said his delegation is committed to the principles of sovereignty and the territorial integrity of all nations and will vote in favour of the draft. Recalling that the first major attack in Europe after the Second World War occurred in 1999 in the former Yugoslavia, he said that there had been no United Nations reaction with regard to Serbia, and the consequences are still felt today. For its part, Serbia will continue to advocate for ending conflict, he said, expressing hope the parties will create peace through dialogue., The representative of Syria said the draft clearly represents a prejudiced attitude based on political propaganda fuelled by political pressure. Language against the Russian Federation attempts to belittle its right to protect its people and its security concerns, and Belarus has been affected by the draft, which represents a flagrant political hypocrisy. Had the United States and its Western allies been serious, they would have fulfilled its promises made decades ago to refrain from transforming Ukraine into a threat to the Russian Federation and should have stopped Ukraine from not complying with the Minsk agreements. Instead, weaponry has been supplied, reflecting the clear-cut desire of those countries to worsen and not de-escalate the current situation. At the same time, an enormous media campaign is spreading lies that are aimed at defaming the Russian Federation and not at resolving the conflict. Such attempts ignore the real reason for tensions and the eruption of hostilities. Those showing support for the draft should have shown the same eagerness related to Israel’s occupation of Arab territories and Turkey’s action against Syria. Syria will vote against the draft because, among other things, it promulgates anarchy, imposes sanctions and will only worsen the situation., Also speaking in explanation, the representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines said her delegation will vote in favor of the text in accordance with its steadfast commitment to the Charter. Strict adherence to international law and international humanitarian law is not optional, she said., The Assembly then adopted the draft by a recorded vote of 141 in favor to 5 against (Belarus, Democratic Republic of Korea, Eritrea, Russian Federation, Syria), with 35 abstentions. Delegates greeted the results with a standing ovation., The representative of Rwanda said his delegation voted in favour of the resolution in support of, and with respect for, the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of any country. Emphasizing that military actions should cease immediately, he said the Russian Federation and Ukraine have the key to resolving the conflict and external intervention will only exacerbate the situation. Expressing serious concern over the extent of humanitarian devastation, and the peace and security challenges caused by the war, he noted reports that Africans are being racially segregated and denied safe exit and admission to neighbouring countries. Rwanda calls upon all those involved to allow unhindered evacuation without looking at individuals’ colour or origin, he stressed., The representative of China said any action taken by the United Nations and relevant parties must prioritize the security concerns of all actors while playing a positive role considering the current situation. Unfortunately, the draft has not undergone full consultations with the full membership nor has it considered all issues related to the situation. As these elements are not in line with China’s principles, his delegation had to abstain from voting. Resolving the conflict requires abandoning the cold war logic and the approach of expanding military blocs to ensure security. Instead, talks must focus on collective security. Calling on the international community to take a responsible approach, he said efforts must be sought to ensure parties engage in dialogue., The representative of India expressed deep concern over the rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine and the ensuing humanitarian crisis, noting that an Indian national was tragically killed in Kharkiv on Tuesday due to ongoing hostilities. He demanded safe and uninterrupted passage for all Indian nationals, including students still stranded in Ukraine, noting that this remains his country’s top priority and it has instituted special flights to bring back Indians home from conflict zones. Moreover, his Government has deployed senior ministers as special envoys to countries neighboring Ukraine to facilitate evacuation, he said, thanking all those countries for opening their borders and extending all facilities to India’s embassies. India has already dispatched humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, including medicines, medical equipment and other relief material, and will be sending one more tranche in the coming days. Supporting the call for an immediate ceasefire and safe humanitarian access to conflict zones, he stressed that differences can only be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy. He underscored the urgent need for humanitarian access and movement of stranded civilians, expressing hope that the second round of talks between the Russian Federation and Ukraine will lead to a positive outcome. Keeping in view the totality of the evolving situation, he said India has decided to abstain from the vote., The representative of Iran reiterated his country’s principled position of respect for the Charter, international law and international humanitarian law. Stressing the importance of avoiding double standards in the maintenance of peace, he pointed to the conflict in Yemen. Expressing concern about the Council’s inaction, he noted that his delegation abstained from the vote., Statements after Adoption, The representative of the European Union delegation, in its capacity as observer, recalling that last week, the Council was unable to act against the Russian Federation’s unprovoked act of aggression because of that country’s veto, said today countries around the world came together to speak against that aggression. Calling on the Russian Federation to immediately stop the aggression, he added that the brutality of that country’s invasion, with the complicity of Belarus, has reached unimaginable levels. Highlighting indiscriminate attacks against Ukrainian cities, he said “this is not just about Ukraine, this is not just about Europe, this is about defending an international order based on rules. This is about whether we choose tanks and missiles or dialogue and diplomacy.” Today's historic vote clearly shows the Russian Federation’s isolation from the rest of the international community, he stressed., The representative of Denmark, speaking also on behalf of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden and associating himself with the European Union, said the international community had come together from all corners of the world to “send a resounding ‘yes’” to uphold international law and the United Nations Charter; the principle of sovereign equality of all United Nations Member States; and respect for their territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence. Moreover, the international community had come together to send a resounding message to Ukraine and all Ukrainians. “You are not alone. We stand with you. Today, tomorrow and until peace is restored and Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity are fully restored and respected,” he said, echoing the words of a colleague who had spoken on Tuesday. He urged the Russian Federation and Belarus to “stop the aggression now”. “What you are doing is unacceptable. It is wrong. Your unprovoked aggression against Ukraine is a violation of the core principles that you signed up to when you laid the foundation of this very organization, of this community of nations,” he said., The representative of Turkey expressed concern about the illegal act of aggression against a founding member of the United Nations “by a permanent member of the very organ entrusted with preserving peace and security”. The ongoing military offensive against Ukraine blatantly violates the fundamental rules of international law, he said, adding that the international community cannot remain spectators. The current resolution emphasizes loudly and clearly that it stands against egregious violations of the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of fellow Member States. It is still not too late to go back to the negotiating table, he said, adding that “as a neighbor and friend of both the Russian and Ukrainian people,” Turkey stands ready to support the peace process., The representative of Poland, reading an open letter written by the spouses of the Presidents of Lithuania and his own country, called on politicians, clergy and concerned citizens across the world to show solidarity with Ukrainian children. A large number of refugees are unaccompanied children fleeing the aggression, he said, adding that their everyday lives are no longer defined by school and time spent with their peers, but rather by bomb shelters. An entire generation of young Ukrainians will bear the scars of this war on their bodies and souls. Continuing to quote the open letter, he underscored that the war is being fought not only in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic but also amid measles and polio epidemics among children. Acknowledging the support received from States and international organizations around the world, he noted that the United Nations wants to allocate $1.7 billion worth of support and called on people of goodwill around the world to do everything possible to end this war., Eritrea’s representative, who voted against the resolution as well, noted that his country’s experience has demonstrated that all forms of sanctions are counterproductive., Representatives of several countries, among them Egypt, Nepal, Italy, Jordan, New Zealand and Colombia, expressed solidarity with Ukraine and stressed the crucial importance of peaceful settlement of disputes. “We know what happens in wars,” the representative of Lebanon said, adding that the energy that went into this text should continue to be directed towards a meaningful peace., The Assembly also heard explanations of vote from delegates that abstained from the vote, with many of them highlighting their misgivings about the resolution and the process of its negotiation., For example, South Africa’s representative said the current text does not lead to an environment conducive to mediation and could lead to a deeper rift between the parties. Her delegation would also have preferred an open and transparent process in the negotiations towards the text, she added, calling on the international community to go beyond gestures that merely appear to promote peace without ensuring meaningful action., The representative of China voiced regret that the draft has not undergone full consultations with the entire United Nations membership. He called on the international community to abandon the cold war logic as well as the approach of expanding military blocs to ensure security. Highlighting the need for collective global security, he stressed the need to ensure parties engage in dialogue., Also speaking during action on the draft resolution were the representatives of Serbia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Thailand, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, India, Bahrain, Iran, Algeria, United Republic of Tanzania, Malaysia and Iraq., Also making statements after the adoption were the representatives of the United Kingdom, Japan, Ireland, Australia, Costa Rica and Indonesia., UKRAINE, For information media.

People often wait up to two days at the border, with outside temperatures dropping well below zero at night., ""Border crossings are open, but the flow is often hampered by bureaucracy.

Ukraine crisis threatens to push millions more children globally into hunger,News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Protection and Human Rights",2 Mar 2022,"GLOBAL, 2 March 2022 -- Skyrocketing wheat prices due to the Russian military operation in Ukraine could put millions of children in the world's most fragile contexts, such as Yemen, Lebanon and Syria, at risk of illness or even death due to hunger, Save the Children said today., The child rights organisation is calling for an immediate end to the violence, not only to protect children in Ukraine but also to prevent further escalation of what is already the worst global hunger crisis this century., Russia and Ukraine account for a significant amount of the world's wheat supply, together exporting more than a quarter of the world's wheat in 2019. The current violence is set to cause a sharp rise in global grain prices, with wheat predicted to rise up to 50% in some countries., In Yemen, where 95% of wheat is imported, including more than 30% from Russia and Ukraine, wheat and bread make up over half of the calorie intake for the average household. Food prices in the country have already more than doubled in the past couple of years, with families forced to reduce food portions or skip meals completely in order to cope. Over half the population is facing acute hunger, according to the World Food Programme., Save the Children's Country Director in Yemen, Rama Hansraj, said: ""The crisis unfolding in Ukraine is having a ripple effect on children elsewhere in the world. Our hearts are breaking for the children in Ukraine, but I cannot stop thinking of the additional horrors that may unfold if this conflict does not stop immediately., ""In Yemen 8 million children are already on the brink of famine. Families are exhausted. They've faced horror after horror through seven years of war. We fear they will not be able to endure another shock, especially to the main ingredient keeping their children alive. No more children should die of starvation."", In Lebanon, up to 80% of wheat imports come from Russia and Ukraine. Only about one month's worth of wheat can be stored at a time in existing mills as a result of the August 2020 blast in Beirut's port that destroyed the country's major grain silos and killed over 200 people., With the country experiencing record high inflation and with more and more families struggling to put food on the table, shortages of staple foods or further hikes in food prices will exacerbate an already desperate situation, Save the Children warned., Jennifer Moorehead, Save the Children's Country Director for Lebanon, said: ""Just months ago, families we work with were telling us how they had been forced to cut their daily food intake by half as the price of basic foods had quadrupled in price since the previous year due to the country's economic crisis., ""It's not an exaggeration to say that in Lebanon, children's survival is hanging by a thread. The wheat imported from Ukraine is a vital lifeline -- cutting this off will doubtlessly push families here to the brink."", There are also concerns for Syria, where domestic wheat production has collapsed following almost 11 years of conflict, displacement and economic crisis. In 2021, the country's total wheat production was just a quarter of its pre-crisis average. Some 12 million people in Syria - 56% of the country's population - are now food insecure., Areas under the government of Syria's control could be particularly affected. The government sought to shore up wheat supplies through Russian imports in 2021, but any risk to this supply could fuel a new wave of hunger., Save the Children's Syria Response Director Sonia Khush said: ""As the world turns to a new crisis and all the horrors this violence unleashes on ordinary people, the needs of Syrian children are at a record high. A global food crisis brought on by the situation in Ukraine brings new threats that these children cannot afford to face."", Save the Children is calling for an immediate end to violence in Ukraine, as this is only way to protect children. It will also prevent a deterioration of the situation for children and families beyond Europe who depend on exports for survival., The conflict has come as the world faces its worst hunger crisis this century, with the number of people at risk of famine rising 60% since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, an estimated 45 million people across 43 countries are at risk of famine, up from 27 million in 2019., Save the Children has been working in Yemen since 1963, implementing programmes in education, child protection, health and nutrition, water and sanitation, and emergency response across most of the country., Save the Children has been working in Lebanon since 1953, supporting children and young people in education, child participation and protection, food security and livelihoods, and access to clean water and shelter., Save the Children's programmes in Syria combine emergency and life-saving interventions with early recovery activities that support the restoration of basic services including child protection, education, emergency response, food security and livelihoods, water, sanitation and hygiene as well as health and nutrition., Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering essential humanitarian aid to children and their families. This includes supporting their access to education, providing psychosocial support, distributing winter kits and hygiene kits, and providing cash grants to families so they can meet basic needs such as food, rent and medicines, or so they can invest in new businesses., The Children's Emergency Fund allows Save the Children to respond to wherever the need is greatest to reach children quickly with the essentials they need to survive., ENDS, Notes to the Editor:, According to the Yemen Socio-Economic Update, domestic wheat production is limited and shrinking against the growing consumer needs. Thus, the sufficiency rate of wheat declined to less than 5%. To bridge the wheat food gap that is estimated at more than 3 million metric tons per annum, Yemen imports more than 95% of its wheat consumption needs from abroad., According to FAO estimates, wheat accounts for 51% of caloric intake of the Yemeni population. Yemen is a net-food-importing country. As such, Yemen's population would suffer considerably at any increase in global food prices., Besides the actual conflict in Yemen, a number of factors have impacted including: the rapid currency depreciation that undermined purchasing power, air and sea port closures, lack of import financing support, soaring and volatile fuel prices and now the escalation in Ukraine. All of this has caused half of the population to go hungry, and today, we are anticipating a catastrophe, beyond anything we ever thought possible, to devastate the country irreparably., For further enquiries please contact:, Emily Wight, Emily.Wight@savethechildren.org;, Our media out of hours (BST) contact is media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409, Please also check our Twitter account @Save_GlobalNews for news alerts, quotes, statements and location Vlogs., Emily Wight l Global Media Manager, Global Media Unit",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-threatens-push-millions-more-children-globally-hunger

Even before the current crisis, nearly half a million children were living lives defined by eight years of war.

Cruz Roja, durante los casi ocho años de conflicto, está trabajando en la región del Donbas atendiendo a la población civil, suministrando artículos de primera necesidad, asistencia sanitaria, o trabajando para el reestableciendo servicios esenciales, como el abastecimiento de agua. A día de hoy, la prioridad es ayudar a la población civil en los momentos de mayor tensión y ansiedad, así como asegurar que sea tratada con humanidad., Durante los últimos años, miles de personas, civiles y combatientes, han muerto o han sido heridas; 1.800 están registradas como desaparecidas por la Cruz Roja Ucraniana y el Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja. Las familias de las personas desaparecidas están buscando respuestas sobre el paradero de sus seres queridos. Ocho años de conflicto, sumados a las restricciones de movimiento debidas a la pandemia, les han impedido ver a sus familiares en el otro lado de la línea de contacto.
Como consecuencia de la escalada en el conflicto y los desplazamientos de población, el contacto con familiares y personas queridas puede verse agravado, lo que causa enorme incertidumbre y dolor. En este contexto, cobra especial importancia el servicio de ‘Restablecimiento del contacto familiar’ que Cruz Roja Española (en coordinación con el Movimiento Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja) ha puesto a disposición de la población ucraniana residente en el España, que puede ayudar a localizar a familiares con quienes se haya perdido el contacto desde que se escaló el conflicto., Así, para las personas que lo necesiten, existe un formulario web en la página de Cruz Roja en el que se puede acceder a este servicio., El programa de ‘Restablecimiento del contacto familiar’ no es una novedad para Cruz Roja, que lo trabaja en todo el mundo desde prácticamente el inicio de su función humanitaria para casos de conflicto, migraciones o desastres naturales., De manera paralela, Cruz Roja Española hace un llamamiento conseguir fondos con los que atender las necesidades humanitarias de la población afectada en Ucrania y países vecinos. Se puede colaborar a través de www.cruzroja.es, mediante el envío de SMS con la palabra UCRANIA al 28092 para donar 1,20€, o mediante BIZUM al 00087, además de los canales tradiciones de transferencia bancaria y teléfono 900 104 971., La respuesta de la Cruz Roja, La prioridad del Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja es ayudar a las personas necesitadas; el 25 de febrero se respondió a las necesidades urgentes de agua proporcionando más de 16.000 litros de agua potable en el pueblo de Olenovka, al este de Donbas. Previo a esta situación, ya se habían proporcionado 3.000 litros de agua al hospital de Dukochaevsk para mantener los servicios en funcionamiento, y 7.000 litros al municipio de Donetsk para servicios esenciales. Además, se instalaron puntos de agua para que la población pudiera abastecerse en Olenovka., La situación a día de hoy impide comprar este suministro en la zona, por lo que el Comité Internacional trata de llevar material desde fuera del país, pero los bloqueos en las carreteras impiden que parte de la ayuda (suministros médicos, mantas…) lleguen, aunque son la mayor prioridad., El personal de Cruz Roja de Ucrania ha detectado a través de su centro de atención telefónica que la población tiene miedo de ir a las tiendas o alejarse de sus hogares debido a los bombardeos, y piden ayuda para obtener alimentos, productos de higiene, mantas, linternas o dinero. Muchas personas no han podido marcharse de las ciudades por sus condiciones físicas o la falta de transporte para ello; algunas de las que siguen en sus hogares, aseguran que no tienen electricidad, o que están en malas situaciones, algo que está afectando especialmente al estado emocional, con gente “a punto de desmoronarse”. La Cruz Roja de Ucrania ha distribuido 30.000 paquetes de alimentos e higiene y ha ayudado a evacuar a personas con discapacidad. Se ha formado en primeros auxilios a mil personas en estaciones de metro y refugios El impacto de lo que está ocurriendo no sólo se sentirá en Ucrania; se prevé un efecto dominó en los países vecinos. Se calcula que más de 500.000 personas han dejado sus hogares y están cruzando a países vecinos según la ONU, por lo que la preocupación por la suerte de las personas que huyen crece y la Cruz Roja en los países vecinos ya está atendiendo a las personas que han llegado a lo largo del fin de semana., Cruz Roja Polaca desplazó equipos de emergencia e instaló albergues temporales desde el jueves 24 en la tarde y está distribuyendo alimentos y artículos de ayuda básica y brindando apoyo médico y psicosocial a las personas que ya han cruzado la frontera de Przemyśl., Así mismo, la Cruz Roja en Rumanía, Eslovaquia, Lituania y Moldavia ha desplegado equipos de emergencia, instalado puntos de albergue temporal y está empezando a apoyar a las personas que llegan con alimentos, agua y apoyo psicosocial., Llamamiento a cumplir el Derecho Internacional Humanitario, Cruz Roja en todo el mundo llama a las partes del conflicto para que se respete el Derecho Internacional Humanitario y no se dirijan ataques a la población, bienes civiles o servicios esenciales. En este sentido, el CICR trabaja en garantizar que los civiles tengan acceso a servicios esenciales, a vivienda y toda la infraestructura básica para su supervivencia en todo momento.
Las partes del conflicto de Ucrania deben garantizar la protección de la población y los detenidos, y deben abstenerse de ataques que violen las reglas de conducción de las hostilidades o las prohibiciones sobre los medios y métodos de guerra. El uso de armas de amplio impacto debe evitarse en zonas pobladas, y se deben respetar los bienes de carácter civil, las infraestructuras esenciales y los suministros de agua, gas o electricidad. Del mismo modo, debe protegerse el espacio para la acción humanitaria neutral, imparcial e independiente, de modo que actores de ayuda como la Cruz Roja Ucraniana, el Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja y el Movimiento Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja deben mantener su acceso a la población civil., El impacto del conflicto durante 8 años, Desde el año 2014, el conflicto activo en la región del Donbas (este de Ucrania) ha tenido consecuencias humanitarias severas para la vida de las personas y su bienestar, sus hogares y para infraestructura esencial. Con violaciones continuas de los altos al fuego acordados, la población se enfrenta a la interrupción del acceso a asistencia sanitaria, alimentos, agua segura, calefacción y electricidad, y también a servicios de educación y sociales y a oportunidades de medios de vida., Incluso antes de los acontecimientos recientes, este conflicto ya golpeaba a la población a diario a nivel psicológico y emocional, que han provocado impacto en la salud o la ruptura de contactos familiares,, Las familias han perdido seres queridos o han sido gravemente heridos, incluidos niños y niñas, mientras trabajan en el campo recogiendo leña, o simplemente jugando en el patio por culpa de las minas y artefactos explosivos sin detonar. Miles de personas han resultado muertas o heridas, y cientos siguen buscando a familiares desaparecidos., Durante estos años, se han reparado infraestructuras vitales, como estaciones de agua que suministran agua potable a más de 800.000 personas; se ha apoyado a las pequeñas empresas con subvenciones en efectivo o equipo y formación profesional; se crea conciencia sobre las minas a través de sesiones educativas y de capacitación; se han marcado zonas peligrosas; se ha ayudado a reparar viviendas, centros de salud, escuelas o centros comunitarios dañados; se apoyan hospitales y centros de atención primaria de salud con medicamentos y equipos médicos para, también, hacer frente a la pandemia de la COVID-19; y se entregan alimentos o artículos de primera necesidad de higiene., Después de 8 años de conflicto, la población en Ucrania se enfrenta a día de hoy a más violencia, dolor, pérdida y confusión., RECURSOS AUDIOVISUALES, Declaraciones de Íñigo Vila, Unidad de Emergencias de Cruz Roja Española y María Alcázar, Cooperación Internacional de Cruz Roja Española + recursos Cruz Roja Ucraniana. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11JfMk8pkBfCwdYfrtuGBIp5buajw7C3h?usp=sharing, Sobre Cruz Roja, Cruz Roja representa el mayor movimiento humanitario, ciudadano e independiente del mundo.

Sus 36 oficinas repartidas por todo el país trabajan de forma coordinada con las sedes operativas de la Cáritas nacional, en Kiev y Lviv., Aunque algunas oficinas locales han tenido que ser evacuadas por razones de seguridad, sobre todo en el Este del país y algunos barrios de Kiev, los centros de Cáritas que siguen a salvo están atendiendo a los desplazados internos y, en coordinación con otras organizaciones humanitarias locales, trabajan en la identificación de las necesidades más urgentes de los damnificados por la escalada bélica., Desde el inicio de la invasión, Cáritas Ucrania mantiene un proyecto de emergencia para satisfacer las necesidades básicas de las personas más vulnerables. En estos momentos, se están equipando con ayuda humanitaria 11 centros de acogida (Kramatorsk, Rubizhne, Zaporizhya, Volnovakha, Mariupol, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Odesa, Ivano-Frankivk) para sumarse al plan de respuesta a la emergencia., La respuesta de Cáritas Ucrania está dando prioridad al reparto de comida caliente, agua, kits de higiene básica, refugio temporal para personas que han abandonado sus hogares, servicio de lavandería y transporte seguro para las personas que buscar reunirse con familiares en otras zonas del país. El plan de emergencia incluye también atención a casos especiales (como ancianos, menores y personas con discapacidad) y acompañamiento emocional básico y actividades de ocio para niños que les ayuden a mantener la normalidad en medio de la situación de gran estrés provocada por los ataques., A pesar de la precaria seguridad y las dificultades, Cáritas continua su trabajo humanitario en Ucrania. Como señala Fr. Vyacheslav Grynevych, director ejecutivo de Cáritas-Spes Ucrania, “nuestras ciudades, casas y jardines de infancia han sido destruidos. Pero nadie podrá destrozar nuestras aspiraciones de paz y libertad”. “En este momento dramático, alabamos el compromiso de los trabajadores y voluntarios, que siguen ayudando a quienes lo necesitan”, añade. “Y con la ayuda de Dios, continuaremos nuestro servicio, sin dejar a nadie atrás”., “Estoy muy orgullosa de nuestros equipos, que están trabajando duro para estar atentos a las necesidades de los más vulnerables, mientras gestionan a la vez sus propias circunstancias personales.

Las Cáritas de Bucarest, Iasi, Maramures y Satu Mare han empezado a evaluar la situación y establecer equipos de primera intervención. El equipo nacional de emergencia ha visitado la frontera y empezado a diseñar planes de intervención para definir un programa de respuesta a la emergencia centrado en la acogida y apoyo a centros de acogida para refugiados (información, servicio de lavandería, servicio de comunicación, alimentos y kits de higiene), programas específicos de acogida infantil, refugio y alojamiento temporal en parroquias locales y movilización de voluntarios para la acogida., Cáritas Polonia está preparando también la acogida, alojamiento y transporte seguro para los refugiados, con programas de emergencia similares a los habilitados por Cáritas en Rumanía., Por su parte, Cáritas Moldavia, que comparte unos 1.200 km de frontera con Ucrania, ha puesto en marcha un plan de emergencia a través de su oficina nacional, en Chisinau, y las seis Cáritas locales en Grigorauca, Rascov, Ribnita, Stauceni, Stircea y Tiraspol.

Protection and Human Rights",1 Mar 2022,"By Noah Smith
MARCH 1, 2022 5:25 PM, About 660,000 refugees have left Ukraine following Russia's invasion on February 24, and another 1 million have been internally displaced, equaling about 4% of the total population, according to UNHCR., Data sourced from border control agencies have shown a little over 57% of Ukrainian residents have gone to Poland. The Polish cities of Rzeszow and Lublin have seen the greatest influx, according to research conducted by Direct Relief's Research and Analysis team, which has been focused on understanding where people are likely to go and which resources will be most needed by them once they arrive., By looking at a combination of Facebook Data For Good's Social Connectedness Index, which measures the strength of friendships and links it geographically, as well as phone-based mobility data from Meta, Schroeder and his team at Direct Relief, in collaboration with Harvard University on a platform called CrisisReady, have been able to better understand where refugees are likely to go. All participants in Meta's initiative have opted-in to the program, which anonymizes the data., ""If you originated in Ukraine, where are you most likely to be connected, in terms of Facebook friends? Does that have a special pattern to it? It turns out, it really does,"" said Andrew Schroeder, Direct Relief's VP of Research and Analysis. ""We can fill in things that you can't find out by looking at the border patrol report,"" he said., Schroeder said that most of the earliest refugees had access to a car and the ability to leave, enabling them to enter the EU and receive free access to free healthcare. They were also more likely than later refugees to bypass official intake procedures and generally opted to stay with friends and family. Online social connections indicated that Poland and the Czech Republic had the strongest social ties to Ukrainians., With a predicted number of up to 5 million refugees, according to the UN, Schroeder and his team are using social data to offer analysis related to where future refugees are likely to go, where sanitation services and food should be directed, and other critical issues likely in the near-term., In Ukraine, about 1,700 people are hospitalized with Covid-19 as oxygen supplies have hit critically low levels, causing the WHO to issue a warning that supplies could run out as soon as Tuesday. Tuberculosis cases, while on a downward trend, still remain high in terms of both case count and mortality, according to the WHO, with over 30,000 cases reported last year., As with any disaster, people with chronic care conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease are especially vulnerable as it can be more difficult to access needed medications. When left untreated, the risk of suffering from a stroke, heart, and asthma attack, or spiking blood pressure increases. In Ukraine, about 15,000 children have Type 1 diabetes, according to the Ukrainian Diabetes Federation, and the local insulin supply is expected to run low as the war continues., Adding to preexisting conditions, refugees crowded into substandard conditions are at a higher risk of contracting norovirus, polio, tuberculosis, and Covid-19. Ukraine has been fighting a polio outbreak since October of last year., Additionally, food security is fast becoming a major concern as Ukraine supplies 13% of global corn and 12% of global wheat which, when added with Russia's crop output, comprises about one-fourth of the world's supply of those staple crops. The World Food Programme (WFP) procures a full 50% of its wheat supplies from Ukraine and nations already facing food security challenges, such as Mozambique and Yemen typically purchase a large amount of their wheat and corn from Ukraine., Direct Relief and CrisisReady reports have so far been shared with a network that links together several major UN agencies and NGOs, including the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the European Commission's Joint Research Center on Demography, Migration, and Governance, Pacific Disaster Center, International Committee of the Red Cross, International Federation of Red Cross and Nethope., Direct Relief's response to the crisis has included the commitment of $500,000 and the delivery of 360 Emergency Medical Backpacks requested by the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, including wound care supplies and tourniquets and other supplies needed to treat people in the field. Direct Relief has also shipped medical items for blood pressure support, intubation/ventilation, IV fluids, antibiotics and more to the Ukrainian Ministry of Health and local partners., Since January 2021, Direct Relief has shipped more than $27 million in medical aid to Ukraine, including $5.4 million worth of medical aid that arrived in the country a week before the invasion, and which was designated for a Ukrainian NGO that serves hospitals, ambulance stations and medical centers., Direct Relief is continuing to monitor the situation and will respond to incoming requests from the Ukrainian Ministry of Health and other partners., Additional reporting was contributed by Dan Hovey, Gordon Willcock, and Paul Sherer.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/where-ukrainian-refugees-are-heading-and-why

GPEI deeply concerned for health of Ukrainian people amid escalating crisis,News and Press Release,GPEI,Health,2 Mar 2022,"Insecurity and displacement increase risk of diseases such as polio, The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is extremely concerned about the unfolding effects of the current crisis in Ukraine on the country’s health system. A functioning health system must be kept neutral and protected from all political or security issues affecting countries, to ensure that people have continued access to critical and essential care., At the same time, we have seen time and again that large-scale population movements, insecurity and hampered access contribute greatly to the emergence and/or spread of infectious diseases, such as polio., Ukraine is currently affected by a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak, with the most recent case detected in January 2022 (with disease onset in December 2021)., A national supplemental polio immunization campaign targeting nearly 140,000 children throughout Ukraine who had not been vaccinated against polio began on 1 February 2022, but is currently paused, as health authorities have shifted focus towards emergency services. Surveillance to detect and report new cases of polio is also disrupted, increasing the risk of undetected spread of the disease among vulnerable populations. The GPEI is working to urgently develop contingency plans to support Ukraine and prevent further spread of polio., The GPEI has a long history of working in a variety of complex environments, and will continue to adapt its operations to the reality on the ground, to the degree possible, without compromising on the safety and security of health workers. At the same time, immunization and surveillance is being assessed in neighbouring countries, to minimize the risk and consequences of any potential infectious disease emergence/spread resulting from the current large-scale population movements. It is critical that necessary resources are mobilized and made available to assist with the humanitarian needs, including relief, disease response/prevention efforts both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/gpei-deeply-concerned-health-ukrainian-people-amid-escalating-crisis

Refugees International strongly supports the decision of the International Criminal Court prosecutor to proceed to open an investigation of this issue pursuant to the Ukrainian government's 2015 decision to accept the jurisdiction of the Court to examine war crimes committed on Ukrainian territory, and pursuant to the requirements of the Rome Statute. We encourage any State Party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court to refer the Ukraine situation to the ICC pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Rome Statute, thus authorizing the prosecutor to launch an immediate official investigation., Our concerns on this issue are only amplified by a record of reports of abuses of international humanitarian law in prior Russian military activity, perhaps most recently in Syria. The resulting forced displacement and suffering---whether in Ukraine, Syria, or other parts of the world---are the inevitable result of practices that merit condemnation."", *For more information or to arrange an interview, please contact Refugees International's VP for Strategic Outreach Sarah Sheffer at ssheffer@refugeesinternational.org. *",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-russian-war-crimes-ukraine

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Mar 2022,"Good morning and good afternoon. Secretary-General Guterres, Emergency Relief Coordinator Griffiths, and High Commissioner Grandi, thank you for your work in issuing this Flash Appeal and gathering support for humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and throughout the region. I am grateful for this opportunity for Mercy Corps to call attention to the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation we see as the result of this conflict. Mercy Corps, like so many other international and local NGOs, is responding to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and the burgeoning refugee flow into the broader region., You’ve heard the startling statistics and context provided by ERC Griffiths and High Commissioner Grandi, and it’s clear that in a short time, this conflict has already exacted a deep and devastating impact on civilians–one that will expand in the coming days, weeks, and months. Mercy Corps and the rest of the NGO community is deeply concerned a humanitarian catastrophe is now unfolding in Ukraine and in the region, threatening lives, infrastructure and livelihoods; creating shortages of essential food and medical supplies; and causing significant displacement and suffering., As the conflict escalates, we expect the greatest humanitarian needs to be food, shelter, water and sanitation services, and cash for people to buy other essential items. We expect the conflict will significantly affect health systems and increase preventable infectious disease, including COVID-19. This conflict will also have reverberating effects in the region and around the world.
As Ukraine is a key supplier of wheat, corn, and sunflower oil, impacts to those supply chains will affect many other response efforts, reducing our collective ability to provide commodities in the Middle East and Africa during a time of heightened food insecurity in Afghanistan, Yemen, and the Horn of Africa. To be clear, this is not a local problem; it is not a regional problem; it is in fact a global problem., We call first and foremost for the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure to minimize the suffering and reduce the scale of damage from this conflict. No amount of humanitarian aid will ever replace lives lost. Parties to this conflict must uphold International Humanitarian Law., Second, we urge the international community to provide additional and sustained assistance for this crisis. Given the number of other pressing humanitarian emergencies happening around the world–from Afghanistan to those suffering from drought in the Horn of Africa– it is essential that new funding for this crisis not come at the cost of responding to those situations., Furthermore, this funding must be as flexible as possible to ensure humanitarian actors on the ground are able to respond to dynamic changes in the conflict and assist people accordingly., We must concentrate on funding relief operations for refugees who manage to cross a border and for the significantly higher number of people in need of aid who remain inside Ukraine - whether in government- or non-government-controlled areas. Mercy Corps also urges the",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/remarks-tjada-d-oyen-mckenna-chief-executive-officer-mercy-corps-un-humanitarian

Ukraine: Commission proposes temporary protection for people fleeing war in Ukraine and guidelines for border checks [EN/UK],News and Press Release,EC,Protection and Human Rights,2 Mar 2022,"Today, the Commission is proposing to activate the Temporary Protection Directive to offer quick and effective assistance to people fleeing the war in Ukraine. Under this proposal, those fleeing the war will be granted temporary protection in the EU, meaning that they will be given a residence permit, and they will have access to education and to the labour market., At the same time, the Commission is also putting forward operational guidelines intended to help Member States' border guards in managing arrivals at the borders with Ukraine efficiently, while maintaining a high level of security. The guidelines also recommend that Member States set up special emergency support lanes to channel humanitarian aid and recall the possibility of granting access to the EU on humanitarian grounds., President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: ""Europe stands by those in need of protection. All those fleeing Putin's bombs are welcome in Europe. We will provide protection to those seeking shelter and we will help those looking for a safe way home."", Vice-President for Promoting out European Way of Life, Margaritis Schinas, said: ""In a historically unprecedented move, the Commission is today proposing to grant immediate protection in the EU for those fleeing Ukraine. All those fleeing the war will be provided with a secure status and access to schools, medical care and work. At the same time, we are working to facilitate efficient crossings at the borders for people and their pets, with the necessary security checks. The times are bearing heavily down upon us but the European Union and every single one of its Member States is showing beyond a doubt that we are ready to step up to the plate and stand in solidarity with Ukraine."", Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, said: ""I'm proud of how the EU and Member States are giving immediate support to those coming from the horrific threats of war. With our proposals today, we will give Member States further capacity to manage this crisis in an orderly and effective way. We will grant residency rights, labour market access and housing to people in need and finally with the guidelines we will make sure those fleeing the war in Ukraine can get to the EU quickly, without going through lengthy formalities at the borders."", Temporary Protection Directive, Since the Russia's military invasion of Ukraine, over 650,000 people have fled to neighbouring EU Member States. The Temporary Protection Directive was specifically conceived to give immediate protection to the persons who need it and to avoid overwhelming Member States' asylum systems., Under this proposal, Ukrainian nationals and people who have made Ukraine their home as well as their family members displaced by the conflict will be entitled to protection across the European Union. Non-Ukrainian nationals and stateless people legally residing in Ukraine who cannot return to their country or region of origin, such as asylum seekers or beneficiaries of international protection and their family members, will also be granted protection in the EU. Others who are legally present in Ukraine for a short-term and are able to return safely to their country of origins will fall outside the scope of this protection. Nevertheless, should be allowed access to the EU to transit prior to returning to their countries of origin., Given the extraordinary and exceptional nature of this attack and the scale of new arrivals to the EU, the Temporary Protection Directive offers the appropriate response to the present situation by:, Guidelines on border management, The guidelines on external border management clarify the facilitations available to Member States' border guards under the Schengen rules in conducting border controls. This will help ensure efficient border management to help those fleeing the war find shelter without delay whilst maintaining a high level of security checks., The facilitations available include:, The guidelines strongly recommend Member States make use of the support EU Agencies can provide -- with Frontex able to assist on identifying and registering people arriving and Europol available to deploy officers supporting Member States with secondary checks., Next Steps, It is for the Council to adopt the Temporary Protection proposal. The Council already expressed broad support for both measures at the extraordinary meeting of Sunday 27 February and has committed to discussing the two documents at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on Thursday, 3 March. Once adopted, temporary protection would start applying immediately and run for 1 year. This period is extended automatically by six monthly periods for a further year., The Commission can propose at any time to the Council to end the temporary protection, based on the fact that the situation in Ukraine allows the safe and durable return of those granted temporary protection, or extend it, by one further year. If the initial period is considered not sufficient to allow the Member States concerned to effectively manage the situation, or the persons enjoying temporary protection to return safely to Ukraine., The guidelines on external border management is a non-binding document intended to support border guards in their work. Member States' border guards can immediately start making use of the clarifications it provides., Background, Since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the EU is supporting the people of Ukraine. Through sanctioning Putin's Russia and the Lukashenko regime in Belarus and stepping up its humanitarian support as well as financial and operational support to Member States, the EU and its Member States are providing a safe haven for people fleeing war in Ukraine., Temporary protection is an exceptional measure to provide immediate and temporary protection to displaced persons from outside the EU and unable to return to their country of origin., The Schengen Borders Code -- which sets the rules governing the crossing of the EU's external borders and the entry conditions inside the EU for non-EU nationals -- provides for flexibility in specific cases, to reduce formalities to a minimum in urgent crisis situations. Today's guidelines clarify the possibilities and facilitations available to Member States' border guards in managing the situation at the EU's external borders with Ukraine., For More Information, Temporary protection proposal, Operational guidelines for external border management to facilitate border crossings at the EU-Ukraine borders, Temporary Protection Directive (2001/55/EC), Proposal for a Regulation addressing situations of crisis and force majeure in the field of migration and asylum, Factsheet",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-commission-proposes-temporary-protection-people-fleeing-war-ukraine-and

Shelter and Non-Food Items",1 Mar 2022,"Bern, 01.03.2022 - Switzerland is delivering around 25 tonnes of relief supplies to the Ukrainian population. Swiss Humanitarian Aid will transport urgently needed materials and medical supplies from the Armed Forces Pharmacy to Poland today and tomorrow. The aid supplies are part of Switzerland's overall support package worth around CHF 8 million., This evening, a cargo plane with around 25 tonnes of relief supplies will fly to Warsaw, delivering medicines and tents for families equipped with mattresses, sleeping bags, woollen blankets, heaters, cooking utensils and water canisters. This will be followed by a six-truck convoy tomorrow delivering medical material provided by the Armed Forces Pharmacy of the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS). The supplies include defibrillators, respirators, hygiene masks, surgical gowns and medical protective clothing for the Ukrainian population both in Ukraine and its neighbouring countries. ""The Ukrainian population is suffering. It is our duty to help them in the here and now, in keeping with Switzerland's humanitarian tradition,"" said President of the Confederation Ignazio Cassis, who is also the head of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA). Swiss Humanitarian Aid, which is part of the FDFA, is setting up an upstream hub in Poland for Switzerland's aid supplies. This should facilitate further aid deliveries to Ukraine and the border area in Poland, and potentially other neighbouring countries as well. Consignments are accompanied by staff of the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit (SHA). A team of SHA experts flew to Warsaw yesterday to plan how the current supplies will be used in the field, and to start up initial emergency measures. Swiss funding for humanitarian organisations: Switzerland has already provided the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Ukraine with half a million Swiss francs and the UN with a quarter of a million. It also made an immediate contribution of half a million Swiss francs to the UN emergency relief fund for Ukraine. Further funding for international organisations such as UN agencies and the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement are being considered in view of the international appeals for assistance issued earlier this week. Switzerland will also support local organisations that are particularly active on the ground and already providing humanitarian aid. Financial resources from the existing CHF 8 million budget have been earmarked for the first phase of Switzerland's humanitarian aid support package., Address for enquiries, FDFA Communication

Shelter and Non-Food Items",2 Mar 2022,"Finn Church Aid (FCA) today pledged euro 1/2 million of its emergency response to aid displaced families in Ukraine and Hungary., OVER ONE MILLION euro has been donated to FCA since the beginning of the conflict on the 24 February and the first part of the grant will help meet the basic needs, such as food, blankets and sleeping bags, of those affected by the conflict in Ukraine and refugees that have arrived in Hungary., Hungary has received tens of thousands of refugees from the Ukraine. FCA funds Hungarian Interchurch Aid, which works both in Ukraine and Hungary, who is distributing 28 tonnes of food at the border area., “There has been a profoundly generous response to our appeal for those displaced by the conflict in the Ukraine,” says Jouni Hemberg, Executive Director of Finn Church Aid., “We are sending half of the funds raised directly to our Hungarian partner, who has established operations in Ukraine and Hungary. At the same time, we are assessing the needs of these people as to how we can help in the days and weeks to come.”, While FCA currently supports those affected by the conflict in Ukraine, it also has the capacity to meet long-term needs, such as food, sanitation, psychosocial support, education in emergencies and livelihoods through its membership of the ACT Alliance., The need for assistance in Ukraine enormous. In a country of over 40 million people 3 million were already in need of humanitarian assistance before the current war. The United Nations refugee agency estimates that over half a million people have already crossed borders into countries neighbouring Ukraine. The need for assistance is expected to increase dramatically in the following days. Many of those who have fled describe the haste with which they left and their difficult journey., “The women of my family have decided to take our children away from danger. We went where the car was taking us, I don’t remember most of the journey. My children were asking where are we going and I couldn’t come up with an answer. We heard that the Polish border is completely jammed, so we decided to cross the mountains and try to make it into Hungary. My sister is still on the way, I have no idea where she or my nieces are,” said Yelena, a mother of three children., “We’ve been standing here at this border checkpoint for more than five hours, it is cold and my children are freezing.

Running a hospital at a desperate time - a story from Western Ukraine [EN/RU],News and Press Release,WHO,Health,2 Mar 2022,"02 March 2022, For patients at Novovolynsk Hospital in western Ukraine, the sound of air raid sirens has suddenly become a common reality amid the military offensive in the country. Patients must move from a modern facility above ground to a 1950s-era underground bomb shelter with a rudimentary set-up that can fit up to 300 people., “In one day, the air raid sirens went off at 5 separate times. Our patients are mostly the elderly and some are on crutches and facing acute health needs. They cannot keep travelling down to the bunker,” says Mr Oleh Shypelyk, Head of the Hospital., The Hospital is equipped with 3 operating rooms. An emergency department provides regular medical care and 6 teams tend to the wounded. Each hospital building is equipped with a generator to ensure a continuous supply of electricity., Health workers are preparing for a range of scenarios should the Hospital become a target in the military offensive. “The main needs are additional generators to ensure electricity supply to the ward with COVID-19 patients – they should stay separate from others – and to the maternity hospital, as women have to give birth regardless of whether there is a war or COVID-19,” explains Mr Shypelyk., “We also need to provide at least 2 generators to the shelter, because in case of bombing, we will not be able to transfer all equipment to the shelter. We also need additional surgical equipment. If hospitals are to be shelled, we must be prepared for that.”, “Health workers must be protected in order to continue to save lives,” says Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative to Ukraine. “Similarly, health facilities must be protected and remain functional, safe and accessible to all who need essential medical services.”, The oxygen supply situation, meanwhile, is also at a very dangerous point in Ukraine. Trucks are unable to transport oxygen shipments from plants to hospitals across the country, including in the capital Kyiv., Despite the challenges posed by the current situation, WHO is actively looking at solutions to increase supplies. This will likely include the importation of oxygen (liquid and cylinders) from regional networks. These supplies will need safe transit, including via a logistics corridor through Poland. WHO is also working to ensure a supply of oxygen-related medical devices and trauma treatment supplies., The WHO Director-General has announced the release of a further US$ 3.5 million from WHO’s Contingency Fund for Emergencies (CFE) to purchase and deliver urgent medical supplies. WHO’s humanitarian health support is expected to increase following further needs assessments. This assistance complements the trauma care and medical supplies which WHO helped to pre-position in health facilities., “We will continue to deliver care and support people across Ukraine affected by this military offensive,” concludes Dr Habicht. “Health for all, in all circumstances, lies at the heart of our mission and mandate.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/running-hospital-desperate-time-story-western-ukraine-enru

Over a quarter of Ukraine’s population have fled their homes, including more than 7.7 million people now estimated to be internally displaced and over 5.2 million people who have crossed borders to seek security and safety in other countries, most of them women and children. Nearly two-thirds of the children in Ukraine have been displaced., Massive devastation in urban centres, and the destruction of civilian infrastructure, have made life unbearable for millions of people and severely disrupted critical services, especially healthcare. In besieged areas, people have lived for weeks without access to food, water and heat, while under the constant threat of bombardment., The war is impacting women and men in different ways and is exacerbating pre-existing inequalities, according to a Rapid Gender Analysis by UN Women and CARE. Ukraine’s population has a distinctly gendered profile, with 54 per cent women and 46 per cent men, including a particularly large population of older females. Prior to the escalation of the war, 71 per cent of the heads of households in Governmentcontrolled areas were female. Women from groups in vulnerable situations are being left behind and disproportionately affected by disruptions caused by war, while the displacement and refugee flow is largely gendered-based violence—including conflictrelated sexual violence, sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) and trafficking., The armed conflict may prevent farmers from accessing their fields, harvesting, and marketing current crops, planting new crops, or sustaining livestock production. Between 20 and 30 per cent of areas under winter cereal, maize and sunflower production will remain unharvested in July/August, or not be planted this spring, according to the Government and FAO. About half of winter wheat and a third of rye due to be harvested in July–August 2022 are currently in war-affected areas. There are also concerns over damage to standing crops and risk of mines and unexploded ordnance impacting the ability to harvest in the period ahead., The war has also devastated Ukraine’s economy. The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Denys Shmyhal, has said that economic losses due to the ongoing military offensive may exceed $1 trillion, while some 53 per cent of employed Ukrainians have lost their jobs since the war began, according to a nation-wide survey conducted by the Rating Group in March.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/un-business-guide-ukraine-humanitarian-crisis-april-2022-0

Victoria Panchenko, Area Manager for HelpAge International in Ukraine, shares her first-hand experience., ""We believed to the last that the invasion would not happen. We relied until the very end on common sense, on a diplomatic solution., But when the fighting did begin, many people still hoped for the best or were sceptical, thinking ""now they will scare us a little, and then there will be negotiations."", I immediately notified all my colleagues when I learned the invasion had begun, making sure they had their emergency bags packed and ready to go., HelpAge's office is located in Sloviansk, a 20-minute drive away from Kramatorsk where the fighting is taking place and we can constantly hear explosions. Some of our volunteers work in the areas where the combat is happening. They hear even more explosions and see military vehicles passing., Some locations where we work are no longer under the control of Ukraine. We are trying to find out what is happening with our volunteers, and if everything is okay with the older people we work with., Many of our volunteers are older people themselves. They are active and responsible, and are an example to follow. They are very happy when we contact them as it supports them psychologically. Most of them are ready to continue supporting their peers, no matter what., Many people fled to the big cities, hoping that the fighting would not reach there, or at least there would be more opportunities for protection, such as taking refuge in the subway. Like everyone, older people would like to flee, but those who can hardly move often have no such option., My emergency bag is packed, but I hope that I will not have to move anywhere. There is a bomb shelter 300 meters away from my house but I am afraid that I won't be able to get there in time., What is happening is a double tragedy for me. My mother was Russian and I have many friends living in Moscow. I can't communicate with them normally, and they are also lost and confused., We are experiencing interruptions in communication: the mobile connection and the Internet are unstable. There is no communication at all in combat areas. There is also no light, heating, or water., There are a lot of fakes in social media and instant messengers that sew panic. My colleagues and I pay great attention to fact-checking all information., We don't know now how far this will go, how many more civilian casualties or destruction there will be. And hope that the talk of nuclear weapons will not come to anything., I try to use special mental techniques to control stress. I would love to rewind time. We had so many plans, we had slowly begun to recover, but now everything has gone wrong., I look forward to peace talks with hope., Thank you to the entire HelpAge International team and everyone who supports us, this is very important.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/helpage-team-ground-ukraine
Ukraine: AOAV’s conflict briefing,News and Press Release,AOAV,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",1 Mar 2022,"By Emily Griffith and Chiara Torelli, For regularly updated casualty figures from explosive weapon use in Ukraine since the beginning of the Russian invasion, follow this LINK, Russia's invasion of Ukraine on the 24th of February 2022 has sent shockwaves across Europe and the world, as the longstanding territorial conflict between to two countries disintegrated into an aggressive, full-scale Russian attack on the independent European democracy of 44 million people. After an alarming build-up of Russian troops along the Belorussian, Russian and annexed-Crimean borders of Ukraine, and Putin's recognition of the independence of eastern regions Luhansk and Donetsk, Russian forces launched a devastating attack by land, air and sea. Putin stands accused of shattering peace in Europe, and widespread condemnation from European governments, NATO countries and beyond has seen the implementation of vast and severe sanctions against Russia. A war of rhetoric also rages from within the Kremlin, as Putin ordered Russia's nuclear deterrence forces to be put on high alert, into a ""special mode of combat service"" -- the most significant escalation of nuclear tensions in Europe since the Cold War., Invading Russian troops were met with fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces and to date (1 March 2022) have been unable to occupy and hold any major cities or gain air-superiority., The cities of Kharkiv and Kyiv are currently suffering the worst of Russian shelling and missile strikes, and the eastern Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk have also suffered severe bombardments (as of 1 March 2022). A convoy of Russian tanks, armed vehicles, towed artillery and support vehicles stretching forty miles bears down on Kyiv. Civilian infrastructure has been targeted outright: a missile hit a kindergarten in northeastern Ukraine and killed at least one child, and a grad-rocket strike targeting residential areas in Kharkiv in the early hours of 28 February reportedly killing dozens and wounding hundreds more, though specific casualty figures beyond 11 civilians confirmed killed are yet to be published., Ukraine's interior ministry has said that as of 27 February, at least 352 civilians have been killed, at least 14 of whom were children, and another 1,684 people injured, 116 of whom are children, since the start of the invasion., The UN estimates that 368,000 people, mostly women and children, have fled the country in the days since the attack began, and UN agencies estimate that as many as five million could flee the war. Most have crossed borders into Poland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, with reports of traffic queues stretching kilometres and people spending tens of hours in their vehicles as temperatures dropped to freezing levels overnight. A fuel crisis and cap on bank withdrawals has compounded the challenges faced by those attempting to leave Ukraine. Families have been separated, as men between the ages of 18 and 60 have been ordered to remain in the country, and many Ukrainian citizens have volunteered to fight in their war for democracy and independence., President Zelenskyy has gained the backing of Ukrainians across the nation, as he refuses to flee the country despite threats to his life and family from the Russian government and multiple offers of evacuation and political asylum. His televised speeches, social media videos and physical presence among troops and civilians in the nation's capital Kyiv has helped to embolden national pride and resolve to resist the invasion and threat of usurpation into Russia's sphere of political influence. Zelenskyy has implored the EU to grant Ukraine immediate membership into the European Union, and encouraged international volunteers to join Ukrainian forces., As of the 28th of February 2022, negotiations have begun between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, in a location on the border with Belarus. Zelenskyy called the first 24hrs of negotions ""crucial"" for Ukraine, and stated he demands a total ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian forces from the country., Since Putin's invasion of Ukraine on February 24th, many countries have enacted harsh sanctions against the Russian financial, energy, military and transport sectors. The European Union, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, South Korea, Switzerland, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom have all unveiled severe measures against Russia and Russian individuals in a united condemnation of Moscow's policies and actions. These sanctions include wide-spread asset freezing and travel ban of President Putin, his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, numerous political officials and oligarchs, as well as officials in Belarus. Russia's banks, financial services, and energy companies have had major economic sanctions enacted upon them, and many leading Russian financial institutions have been removed from the Swift global payments system., The Military Situation, While the Ukrainian armed forces are more experienced and better equipped than in 2014, at the beginning of this invasion they were heavily outmanned and outgunned, though recent packages of arms support and military aid from EU and NATO nations attempts to tip the scales., Since 2014 and in the lead up to the invasion on February 24th, many European and NATO countries provided military aid to Ukraine. The US sent Javelin anti-tank missiles, coastal patrol boats, Humvees, sniper rifles, reconnaissance drones, radar systems, night vision and radio equipment, while Canada operated a training programme. Turkey sold Kyiv several batches of Bayraktar TB2 drones, and signed a deal with Ukraine allowing Ukrainian factories to build the Turkish drones. Britain supplied a reported 2,000 short-range anti-tank missiles, light-armour defensive weapons systems, and Saxon armoured vehicles, and sent British specialists to deliver training. Denmark supported the modernisation of Ukraine's military according to NATO standards. Estonia planned to provide Javelin anti-armour missiles, and Latvia and Lithuania have provided Stinger missiles. The Czech Republic planned to donate 152mm artillery ammunition. Poland supplied Ukraine with artillery ammunition, mortars, portable air-defence systems, and surveillance drones. Germany co-financed a $6 million field hospital and provided training. Since the start of the Russian invasion, countries across Europe and north America have pledged extensive further military, medical and humanitarian aid to Ukraine., The US has released an additional $350 million worth of weapons from US stocks to Ukraine, including various munitions to support front-line defenders such as anti-armour weapons, small arms, body armour, and anti-aircraft systems., The UK has also committed to supplying Ukraine with light anti-armour defensive weapon systems, and packages of lethal and non-lethal aid., France has dispatched anti-aircraft weapons, fuel, and digital weapons., The Netherlands agreed to supply 200 Stinger air-defence rockets and 50 Panzer-faust 3 anti-take weapons, and 400 rockets., Germany, who previously had withheld lethal-aid due to a longstanding position of banning weapons exports to conflict zones, will now supply 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles., Canada is sending lethal military weaponry as well as $394 million USD towards the defence effort., Sweden, in an historic break from it's neutral stance, has sent 5,000 anti-tank rockets as well as field rations and body armour., Belgium has committed to supplying Ukraine with 3,000 automatic rifles and 200 anti-tank weapons, as well as 3,800 tonnes of fuel., Portugal is sending night-vision goggled, bulletproof vests, helmets, grenades, ammunition and automatic G-3 rifles., Greece, a country with a significant diaspora in Ukraine and has already suffered 10 fatalities in the invasion, is sending both defence equipment and humanitarian aid., Romania has offered to treat wounded people from crisis zones in 11 military hospitals and to send fuel, bulletproof vests, helmets and military materials worth $3.3 million., Spain has pledged to send 20 tonnes of aid, most of which is medical and defensive equipment., Czech Republic is sending 4,000 mortars, 30,000 pistols, 7,000 assault rifles, 3,000 machine guns, sniper rifles and a million bullets., Russia's army counts about 280,000 personnel, and its combined armed forces total about 900,000. Their combat force is equipped with tanks, artillery, rockets, and other heavy weaponry, and is bolstered by a well-equipped fleet in the Black Sea. Furthermore, Russia has been equipping the separatists rebels in the Donbas region with advanced Electronic Warfare and anti-aircraft systems. However, it has been shown that the use of Bayraktar TB2 drones can only be deterred with air defence systems or fighter aircraft, both of which Russia owns but the presence of which on Ukrainian soil would, in all likelihood, provoke an all-out war., Prior to the invasion, Zelenskyy signed a decree increasing the size of Ukraine's armed forces by about 100,000 troops over three years, and raising soldiers' pay. The aim is to strengthen the state's defence capabilities, increase the attractiveness of military service, and eventually bring Ukraine's armed forces to about 361,000. The Ukrainian armed forces also comprise around 900,000 reservists and a volunteer Territorial Defence force, which it aims to build into a corps of 130,000 fighters to defend civilian sites. Furthermore, most adult males have at least basic military training, so resistance is likely to take the form of protracted urban guerrilla warfare., Ukraine remains vulnerable to air strikes, due to limited anti-aircraft and anti-missile defences, but they do have short-range air defences and anti-tank weaponry., Conflict Background: Timeline, Ukraine has endured a tense relationship with Russia ever since its independence from the Cold-War era superpower in 1991. A succession of pro-Russian versus EU-leaning governments from 2004 to 2013 pulled Ukraine in opposing directions, until Yanukovych's government took concrete steps to strengthen Ukraine's ties to Russia in 2013. Yanukovych suspended trade and association talks with the EU in November 2013 and opted to revive economic ties with Moscow, triggering months of mass rallies in Kyiv and an aggressive Russian reaction. A timeline from 2014 onwards is presented here to illustrate the long-standing tensions, international and non-international armed conflicts, and military occupation which have paved the way for the current crisis., 2014, The protests following Yanukovych's pro-Russian policies, known as the EuroMaidan protests, turn violent, and dozens of protesters are killed., February -- Parliament votes to remove Yanukovych, who flees to Russia. Armed men seize parliament in the Ukrainian region of Crimea and raise the Russian flag., March 16th -- a referendum shows overwhelming support in Crimea for joining the Russian Federation, and Moscow annexes the territory. Despite the alleged referendum, the Geneva Academy classifies Russia's presence in Crimea as a military occupation., April -- Pro-Russian separatists in the eastern region of Donbas declare independence. A non-international armed conflict develops which has continued intermittently into 2022, despite frequent ceasefires. Russia backs the separatists with equipment, training, and soldiers., September -- Minsk I is signed. It puts forward a 12-point ceasefire deal between Ukraine and the separatists, which includes provisions for prisoner exchanges, deliveries of humanitarian aid, and the withdrawal of heavy weapons. However, it quickly breaks down., 2015 -- Minsk II is signed by representatives of Russia, Ukraine, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the leaders of separatist-held regions Donetsk and Luhansk. However, it is never implemented., 2017 -- The EU passes an association agreement with Ukraine, opening markets for free trade of goods and services, and visa-free travel to the EU for Ukrainians., 2018 -- Three Ukrainian Navy vessels are fired upon and then captured by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). 24 Ukrainians are captured and sent to prison in Moscow. In response, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko declares martial law along the Ukrainian border with Russia, which is approved by the Parliament and lasts until 26 December 2018., 2019 -- Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a former actor, wins the April presidential election, and promises to tackle corruption and end the conflict in eastern Ukraine., 2021, January -- Zelenskyy appeals to US president Biden for Ukraine to join NATO., February -- Zelenskyy's government imposes sanctions on Viktor Medvedchuk, an opposition leader and the Kremlin's most prominent ally in Ukraine., March and April -- Russia concentrates about 100,000 military personnel close to the Ukrainian border, claiming they are conducting drills. The soldiers are eventually moved back to rear bases, but much of the infrastructure for military operations remained in place., December -- Russia presents detailed security demands to the West, including a legally binding guarantee that NATO will give up any military activity in eastern Europe and Ukraine. Peace talks break down, and Russia renews its military build-up along the Ukrainian border., **2022 **-- Russian troops arrive in Belarus to conduct joint military drills. Washington presents a written response to Russia's demands, confirming their commitment to NATO's ""open-door"" policy. Putin maintains that Russia's security demands have not been addressed. NATO troops are on stand-by and reinforce eastern Europe with personnel, ships, and fighter jets., Civilian Casualties in Ukraine, 2014-2021, Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) has monitored an escalation in violence in the Donbas region, which borders Russia, and where violence between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists has occurred since 2014., Between 2014 and 2021, AOAV recorded 5,242 deaths and injuries in Ukraine, including 2,704 civilians and 2,538 armed actors and security personnel. Of the civilian casualties recorded, 2,381 (88%) were caused by explosive weapon use in populated areas., Ground-launched weapons, such as shelling, mortars, rockets, or grenades, for example, have accounted for 2,459 civilian casualties since 2014 -- 91% of total civilian casualties., Of the civilian casualties, the vast majority occurred in 2014 and 2015, with 1,428 and 862 civilian deaths and injuries in these years respectively. Despite continued sporadic shelling across the line of control, which divides the region of Donbas, civilian casualties have fallen quite consistently since 2014, with 28 recorded last year. Fewer civilian casualties are also likely to have occurred as numerous civilians have fled the worst impacted areas in Donbas since 2014, leaving an aging population, many of whom cannot leave., In many instances of shelling since 2014, the perpetrator has not been identified, but where they have, Ukrainian separatist forces have been responsible for at least 667 civilian casualties and Ukraine for 783., In the days preceding the Russian invasion, there was an increase in shelling across the line of control, which has resulted in seven civilian casualties. At least three civilians were injured on February 17th when separatist shelling hit a school in Luhansk. On the same day, separatist shelling left another woman injured in Marinka as she waited for a bus. Shelling by Ukrainian forces was also reported to have left one woman injured on February 17th. On February 20th, 2 civilian deaths were reported due to Ukrainian shelling in occupied areas of Luhansk. And, on February 21st, a civilian was killed and homes damaged by separatist shelling on Donetsk., This escalation in violence and the Russian invasion is likely to be disastrous for civilians, as highlighted by the statement released today by the International Network on Explosive Weapons (INEW), of which AOAV is a founding member., AOAV condemns the use of violence against civilians and the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. AOAV encourages all armed actors to stop using explosive weapons with wide-area affects where there is likely to be a high concentration of civilians.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-aoav-s-conflict-briefing
Joint Statement by Global Civil Society Organizations to UNEA 5.2 on Ukraine,News and Press Release,PAX,"Climate Change and Environment
Health
Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding",1 Mar 2022,"On behalf of 108 NGOs we want to share the following statement:, We are deeply worried as we are witnessing the grave humanitarian consequences of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This armed conflict poses serious risks to the lives and health of Ukraine’s people in the first place, while in turn this can also bring severe environmental health risks and affects Ukraine’s biodiversity, ecosystems and natural resources that they depend on., We are gathered here in Nairobi to address a wide range of environmental issues, and to Act for Nature. Yet we must underscore the relationship between armed conflicts and the environment., Already there are serious concerns over the state of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. Critical staff struggle with maintenance of the Chernobyl nuclear site, currently under control of Russian forces, and other nuclear waste storage sites are at risk from nearby shelling., Furthermore, there are hundreds of industrial sites at risk from being targeted, and capable of causing environmental emergencies if hit, placing the health of nearby communities and ecosystems at risk in the near- and long-term. In recent days, several fuel depots and gas lines were bombed, with additional reports of burning warehouses storing chemicals. Damage to water infrastructure affects water security, and damage and disruption to electricity networks heightens the risks of flooding mines storing nuclear and toxic waste in Donbas, that can further increase risks for the entire region, and may eventually make large parts of it uninhabitable., Destruction of people’s habitats and collapse of environmental governance will further contribute to serious issues around public health, solid waste management and controls of chemical and industrial toxics, in particular those in populated areas. Russian attacks on munitions depots have already led to the dispersal of military-origin heavy metals and toxic hazardous energetic materials, posing additional human health and environmental risks., In 2016, UNEA-2 adopted a Ukrainian resolution on the protection of the environment in areas affected by armed conflict. The necessity of this was reiterated in 2017, when UNEA-3 adopted an Iraqi-led resolution on conflict-pollution., Today, we are urging States here in Nairobi to once again, and under pressing circumstances, stress the importance of addressing the relationships between the environment, peace and security. And, in response to the serious environmental risks triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, to:, Provide funds and technical expertise for an initial rapid environmental assessment by UNEP in consultation with humanitarian agencies and civil society groups, in Ukraine;, Support local and international initiatives for the identification and monitoring of conflict-linked en vironmental risks and damage, and;, Pledge the environmental assistance necessary to Ukraine to address the consequences of the conflict for its people and ecosystems, and to support clean-up and restoration efforts., Ukraine is just one of many countries where armed conflicts are impacting the environment and undermining environmental governance., We therefore urge States to ensure that the environmental dimensions of armed conflicts are part of UNEP’s core work, as well as that of UNEA. We urge States to push back against the vocal minority of governments that oppose UNEP’s activities in this space. We also urge them to ensure that UNEP’s historical and vital work on the environmental dimensions of conflicts remains a visible and a meaningful part of its current Medium-Term Strategy, as was promised., The situation in Ukraine demonstrates why these themes must be a part of the Assembly’s dialogues and decisions. Their absence from a range of relevant resolutions this year has not gone unnoticed. Whether this is the link between biodiversity loss and armed conflicts, between mineral resource governance and insecurity, or in the potential role that nature can play in supporting human security, or in postconflict recovery and conflict transformation., UNEP and UNEA must grasp the vital role that they can play in advancing the environment, peace and security agenda, and in turn supporting stronger norms on the protection of the environment in relation to armed conflicts across the whole UN system, and beyond.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/joint-statement-global-civil-society-organizations-unea-52-ukraine
Ukraine – ACTED ready to support affected populations and refugees,News and Press Release,ACTED,"Food and Nutrition

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Mar 2022,"1 March 2022 – In a context of rapidly evolving situation on the ground, at least 406 civilian casualties have already been confirmed between 24 and 27 February – though the real figure is almost certainly much higher – and thousands of people are fleeing major cities of Ukraine. As of early 1 March, at least 653,000 people have already crossed into neighboring countries, according to REACH data., While our activities have been temporarily suspended in the country to ensure the safety of our staff, our teams are preparing to respond in Poland, Romania, and Moldova where refugees continue to arrive after five days of intense clashes across Ukraine., Tens of millions of civilians will be affected, “As of early March 1, around 377,000 people had reportedly entered Poland, 71,000 into Romania and 94,000 into Moldova. Traffic jams to leave conflict hotspots and to enter neighboring countries are dozens of kilometers long, leaving people to wait for days in their cars. Some decide to leave their vehicles and finish the journey on foot with few belongings. Petrol is hard to get across the country, it’s very cold outside, there is no water, no sanitation facilities along the way. Women, children, and the elderly make up the majority. People require urgent assistance to protect themselves from the cold, get warm food, water while they travel” said the ACTED Country Director., As the number of civilian casualties continues to grow and damage to critical infrastructure increases, ACTED is scaling-up its humanitarian assistance to help ensure those in transit, internally displaced or remaining in hotspots receive the basic support they need, including cash assistance, water, food and hot meals, blankets, hygiene supplies and access to mobile heating points., Eight years of conflict in Eastern Ukraine, The conflict has already killed 14,000 people in the Donbas area since 2014. ACTED started its operations in Eastern Ukraine in 2015 to provide cash support to vulnerable affected people along the line of contact to help them meet their food, shelter and other basic needs, while working on industrial risks prevention stemming from the conflict. The elderly and children are among the most vulnerable.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-acted-ready-support-affected-populations-and-refugees
Sweden further increases humanitarian support to Ukraine,News and Press Release,Govt. Sweden,Contributions,28 Feb 2022,"On Sunday 27 February, Minister for International Development Cooperation Matilda Ernkrans held a press briefing on Sweden’s support to Ukraine together with Göran Holmqvist, Director of Humanitarian Support at Sida., Sweden has long been one of the biggest donors of development assistance to Ukraine, comprising both reform-oriented development cooperation and humanitarian support. In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Government has decided to provide additional funds to alleviate the suffering of the Ukranian people., “In light of the horrendous developments in recent days, the Government has now decided to donate an additional SEK 20 million to support the work of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Ukraine. Sweden has thus increased its humanitarian response to Ukraine to SEK 55 million,” said Ms Ernkrans., Each year, Sweden provides substantial development aid to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which is operating on the ground at the border between Ukraine and Moldova, where many Ukrainians are fleeing. The support can be used for swift action to help refugees, where the needs are greatest., “In view of rapidly increasing refugee flows, the Government has also decided to bring forward a payment of SEK 50 million to UNHCR to address the humanitarian needs caused by the developments in Ukraine,” said Ms Ernkrans., Ms Ernkrans presented disbursements and support measures worth a total of SEK 100 million. This consists of SEK 50 million to UNHCR, SEK 30 million to the UN’s humanitarian country-level pooled fund and SEK 20 million to the ICRC., Sweden has thus contributed a total of SEK 391 million in humanitarian aid to Ukraine since 2014., Sida’s Director of Humanitarian Support Göran Holmqvist stressed the seriousness of the humanitarian situation and that the greatest needs will be among those who are unable to flee. Sida can quickly approve the transfer of resources to where they are most needed. Sida is currently awaiting needs analyses from UN bodies such as OCHA and UNHCR so as to be able to respond to the situation effectively.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/sweden-further-increases-humanitarian-support-ukraine
Ukraine Russia Crisis: Terrorism Briefing,Analysis,IEP,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",1 Mar 2022,"On 24 February, Russia launched an attack on Ukraine. Figure 1 highlights that the invasion comes after a decade of deteriorating relations between Russia, Ukraine and the West., This brief covers several aspects relating to the current Ukrainian war, including the frequency of past acts of terrorism in Russia, Ukraine and Georgia and cover likely future scenarios. It also analyses cyberattacks on Ukraine over the last decade and lead up to the current war., The main finding is that terrorism increases with the intensity of conflict. Both the Georgian conflict in 2008 and the Ukrainian conflict of 2014 saw substantial spikes in terrorist activity around the wars, and as the current war intensifies increased terrorist activity should be expected., Secondly, cyberattacks on Ukraine have markedly increased over the last decade, and especially in the months and weeks leading up to the war. Further, cyberattacks have the potential to unintentionally spillover into other countries because of global connectivity. The effects of which have been seen on numerous occasions. As cyberattacks by nefarious actors are a recent phenomenon, and given the difficulty in the attribution of such attacks, the demarcation between what constitutes a cyberattack, cyber warfare or cyber terrorism are unclear. Regardless, this report looks at the broad phenomena of cyberattacks in Ukraine to offer background on recent events., HIGHLIGHTS, • There is a strong relation between terrorism and conflict, with 97 per cent of all terrorist deaths recorded in a conflict zone., • Terrorism deaths in Ukraine are expected to increase substantially in the coming months and will rise proportionally with the intensity of the conflict., • This is despite that terrorism in Russia and Ukraine had been an improving - in Russia since 2012 and the Ukraine since 2015., • Terrorist attacks in Russia had been declining since 2012 when 213 attacks were recorded. In 2021 there was only one., • Terrorist attacks in Ukraine peaked in 2015 with 58 attacks, while in 2021 there were none., • Terrorist deaths in Ukraine peaked during 2014 conflict with Russia., • Terrorism peaked in the Russia and Eurasia region in 2010 in the wake of the Russian-Georgia conflict with 339 attacks and 318 deaths recorded., • The period in between the conflict with Georgia and the annexation of Crimea accounted for the most terrorism in Russia over the last two decades with 87 per cent of attacks and fatalities occurring between 2008 and 2014., • Russia, Ukraine and Belarus were the only countries in the region to record over one thousand violent demonstrations in 2021.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russia-crisis-terrorism-briefing
Russia/Ukraine: Invasion of Ukraine is an act of aggression and human rights catastrophe,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,1 Mar 2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a manifest violation of the United Nations Charter and an act of aggression that is a crime under international law, said Amnesty International as it called for all those involved in this crime to be held accountable for those violations. Their personal, individual, and collective liability should be invoked for that, and for all the many crimes that have characterised their invasion of Ukraine thus far., Emphasizing the gravity of the Ukraine crisis, the organisation called on UN member states to uphold and defend the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. It noted that the only exceptions to those provisions are self-defense and such use of force as is authorized by the UN Security Council – neither of which applies to this crisis., Amnesty further stressed that, under international law, it is incumbent on all states to settle international disputes by peaceful means and in such a manner that international peace, security, and justice, are not endangered., “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is grave, severe and defined by one characteristic only: aggression. Russia is invading into the heart of Ukraine, seeking to depose its lawfully elected government, with a real and potential massive impact on civilians’ lives, safety and well-being; its acts cannot remotely be justified on any of the grounds that Russia has offered. Yet all of this is being committed by a permanent member of the UN Security Council,” said Agnes Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International., “Russia is in clear breach of its international obligations. Its actions are blatantly against the rules and principles on which the United Nations was founded. All members of the United Nations should condemn that conduct unequivocally. Russia’s flagrant disregard cannot be allowed to embolden others to follow suit and nor should the UN’s ability to contain such behaviour be undermined.”, Since the Russia invasion began on 24 February, Amnesty has been documenting the escalation in violations of humanitarian and human rights law, including deaths of civilians resulting from indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and infrastructure. Strikes on protected objects such as hospitals and schools, the use of indiscriminate weapons such as ballistic missiles and the use of banned weapons such as cluster bombs, may all qualify as war crimes., Amnesty International urged UN Member States to stand together in condemnation of Russia’s crimes of aggression, in providing relief and assistance to the citizens of Ukraine including those fleeing the conflict, and to ensure the consequences of Russia’s aggression are not allowed to push the world closer towards an abyss of violence, violations and insecurity., “In less than a week, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered a massive human rights, humanitarian, and displacement crisis that has the makings of the worst such catastrophe in recent European history. Russia is not only breaching the sovereignty of a neighbour and its people, it is also challenging the global security architecture and exploiting its frailty, including a dysfunctional UN Security Council. There are long-lasting consequences from this for us all. We must not allow aggression and violations of international law to be their architect,” said Agnes Callamard., Yesterday’s welcome announcement by the ICC Prosecutor that his office will seek to open an investigation in Ukraine puts all perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine– including those in senior positions and most responsible – on notice that they will be held individually accountable., “Amnesty International calls on all states parties to the ICC and the international community at large to cooperate with the ICC’s investigation. The ICC’s investigation cannot take place alone. Comprehensive accountability in Ukraine requires the concerted and innovative efforts of the UN and its organs, as well as initiatives at the national-level pursuant to the principle of universal jurisdiction,” said Agnes Callamard., “At this early stage, the collection and preservation of evidence is crucial to successful future investigations. Above all, we must ensure that the tragically increasing number of victims of war crimes in Ukraine hear a message that the international community is already determined to secure redress for their suffering.”, Background, Serious violations of the rules of conflict constitute war crimes. Some of those are codified as such by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The ICC would have jurisdiction over war crimes committed in Ukraine, which made a declaration in 2015 accepting ICC jurisdiction over crimes committed on its territory since 20 February 2014. Russia signed the Rome Statute in 2000 but withdrew its signature in 2016., The military intervention appears to meet the definition of aggression under the Rome Statute of the ICC. Art. 8bis(1) of the Rome Statute defines, in relevant part, a “crime of aggression” as “an act of aggression which, by its character, gravity and scale, constitutes a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations.” Although the Court, barring an unlikely Security Council referral, will not have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in this situation a number of states, including Ukraine, have domestic laws that would allow prosecution of those responsible for this crime., The invasion of Ukraine has already resulted in indiscriminate strikes on residential areas, medical institutions, social infrastructure and other civilian objects and infrastructure, and produced civilian deaths and injuries. It has led to mass displacement and destruction of civilian housing. In the fighting in Donetsk and Luhansk, particularly in 2014-2015, there have been extrajudicial executions, torture and other ill-treatment, enforced disappearances, and unlawful deprivation of liberty., For more information contact Stefan Simanowitz press@amnesty.org

Protection and Human Rights",1 Mar 2022,"PLENARY
ELEVENTH EMERGENCY SPECIAL SESSION, 3RD & 4TH MEETINGS (AM & PM)
GA/12406, Delegates Urge All Parties to Respect Principles of United Nations Charter, Speakers Representing Small, Developing States Decry ‘Might Makes Right’ Concept, At the dawn of a new era forced upon the world by the Russian Federation’s war in Ukraine, Member States must now take sides and choose between peace and aggression, delegates said today as the General Assembly moved into the second day of its emergency special session., [The emergency special session — the eleventh called since the founding of the United Nations — opened on 28 February, meeting less than 24 hours after being mandated to do so by a vote in the Security Council, following its failure to adopt a resolution condemning the Russian Federation’s recent actions in Ukraine. See Press Releases SC/14808 and SC/14809 for details.], With 115 of the United Nations 193 Member States scheduled to address the emergency session, held from 28 February to 2 March, delegates today sounded calls to end the ongoing bombings and attacks on civilians in Ukraine and for all parties to respect the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, especially provisions on security and peace among countries. (See Press Release GA/12404 for details on the session’s opening day.), “The fate of Ukraine is our fate; today, we are all Ukrainians,” said Luxembourg’s representative, mirroring a thread of solidarity woven throughout the day-long meeting amid numerous calls for Member States to support the Assembly’s draft resolution calling for an end to the conflict. Supporting the proposed resolution means voting to save lives, he said, noting Luxembourg’s co-sponsorship of the draft that, among other things, calls for peace talks and the full withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine., Many other delegates also announced their co-sponsorship of the draft, with Spain’s representative saying that its subject centres on the sovereignty of Ukraine, the defence of peace and the diplomatic resolution of conflict, as well as “the very reason the United Nations exists”. Echoing broad condemnations of the invasion of Ukraine, he said: “Every minute of resistance makes the attackers’ self-justification vanish into thin air.”, Germany’s delegate said the Russian Federation’s war marks the dawn of a new era, and today, there is a new reality that President Vladimir Putin has forced upon the world, requiring all States to make firm decisions and take a side. Germany will always be committed to diplomacy, but when peaceful approaches come under attack, she said “we must act responsibly and unite for peace”. As the Assembly prepares to vote on the draft resolution, she stated that: “Now, we all have to choose between peace and aggression, between justice and the will of the strongest, between taking action and turning a blind eye.” While Germany is providing food, aid and shelter for refugees, she said it has decided to support Ukraine militarily to protect itself, in line with Article 51 of the Charter., Speakers roundly called for an end to violence and a start to constructive peace talks. Some drew attention to the conflict’s origin. The representative of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea said the root cause of the current situation rests with the United States and other Western countries. These States have systematically undermined the European security environment by defying the Russian Federation’s reasonable demand for legal security guarantees and pursuing the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Recalling the violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya by the United States and the West under the pretext of international peace and security, he said that it is “absurd” for such countries to mention respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity in the context of the Ukrainian situation., Some delegates representing small States decried the “might makes right” concept, which many agreed must be replaced with the guiding principles of the Charter of the United Nations., “This is a crisis for all of us, and we all must speak out for diplomacy and support this resolution,” said the representative of Antigua and Barbuda. The international community has the responsibility to speak out, “lest our silence be misconstrued as consent”. As such, he called on all countries — especially small island States — to affirm that “might is not right”., Amid widespread condemnation of continued bombing and shelling across Ukraine that has seen more than 500,000 civilians fleeing the violence, some delegates shared their own experiences with war, recalling the horrors that faced their citizens., “My country still exists today because the peoples of the United Nations at the time stood up immediately to the cries of the innocent lives,” said the representative of the Republic of Korea, adding that: “This is why my delegation does not see the situation in Ukraine as some distant tragedy.”, Many delegates announced pledges of humanitarian assistance to help the people of Ukraine, with some neighbouring States saying they were ramping up border capacities to swiftly help those fleeing the violence. Some speakers called attention to racist practices targeting people of African descent who are stuck in Ukraine, trying to escape to safety., The representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines expressed dismay that people of African descent are being singled out unfairly as the refugee crisis unfolds, calling for equal, fair treatment of all peoples. Echoing that call, South Africa’s representative urged European countries to take steps to resolve the current situation whereby some African nationals and people of African descent at the borders of Ukraine are not allowed to cross and move to safety., Referring to efforts to welcome those fleeing Ukraine, Hungary’s representative said all cases of discrimination will be investigated and perpetrators held accountable. Highlighting ongoing initiatives to respond to requests from nations to evacuate their citizens from Ukraine, she said Hungary has allowed entrance for all those fleeing war without restrictions or discrimination as to race, ethnicity, religion or country of origin., Many speakers stressed the importance of human rights and adhering to the founding principles of the United Nations Charter. Recalling that the Charter has been thrown out the window when it has suited powerful States, Ghana’s delegate stated that: “Across this hall and throughout our Organization’s history, there is enough blame to go round.” However, he warned against opening old wounds, which only creates fresh ones. Indeed, given the Security Council’s constraints, he stated that it is now the General Assembly’s responsibility to act., Agreeing, Jamaica’s delegate said that inaction by the international community would be unacceptable, adding that: “In the eternal and inspiring words of Bob Marley, therefore, let us all get up and stand up for the rights of all the people of Ukraine, because today — we are all Ukraine.”, Also delivering statements today were representatives of Colombia, Paraguay, Dominican Republic, Suriname, Brunei Darussalam, Palau, Antigua and Barbuda, Federated States of Micronesia, Australia, Guyana, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, Monaco, Belize, Gabon, Cuba, Samoa, Philippines, Cabo Verde, Malta, Malaysia, Kuwait, Malawi, Marshall Islands, Israel, Andorra, Côte d’Ivoire, Republic of Moldova, Nepal, Grenada, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Argentina, Thailand, Niger, Nicaragua, Romania, Montenegro, San Marino, Cyprus, Portugal, Zambia, Bangladesh, North Macedonia, Vanuatu, Haiti, Tonga, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Mauritius, Tunisia and Qatar., The General Assembly will reconvene Wednesday, 2 March, at 10 a.m. to continue its emergency special session., Statements, MARTA LUCÍA RAMÍREZ, Vice-President and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia, said the current situation in Ukraine is harming a United Nations Member State, violating the Ukrainian people’s rights and threatening peace in Europe and the world. Hundreds of thousands are fleeing, a financial panic has emerged worldwide and the terrible violations must be addressed, with the Russian Federation held accountable for its actions. Noting that Colombia has co-sponsored the draft resolution, she added that all States should impose economic sanctions against the aggressor. Indeed, totalitarian regimes require strong action against them. All existing mechanisms must be employed to ensure compliance with agreements made by nuclear-weapon States, given the recent related threats. Commending the International Criminal Court decision to investigate allegations of possible genocide, she said that: “Today, we must be united for peace.” It would be unacceptable — with an ongoing pandemic — for an arms race to emerge. Instead, the world must focus on fighting poverty, hunger and climate change, while asserting that it does not accept threats. The Russian Federation cannot turn back the clock to a time when empires flourished at the cost of other people’s rights, she said, adding that the world would not accept a return to the past., JULIO CÉSAR ARRIOLA RAMÍREZ (Paraguay) underlined the urgent need for Security Council reform, given the current situation. Amid threats of the use of nuclear weapons, he said there is no justification for this type of intimidation, calling on possessor States to comply with their commitments to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Paraguay — which co-sponsored the draft resolution — calls for a cessation of violence. The Security Council must discharge its functions, and efforts must be made to re-establish peace and security while relieving the pain and suffering of those affected. Welcoming the Security Council meeting on 28 February to determine the humanitarian needs of Ukrainians, he called for an urgent response to those in vulnerable situations. Paraguay, as a Human Rights Council member, calls for the full respect of the human rights of Ukrainians. There is also a need to return to the negotiation process based on current international mechanisms, the Charter of the United Nations and relevant resolutions. Dialogue is the only path open, he said, expressing hope that talks on 28 February will advance the process., JOSÉ ALFONSO BLANCO CONDE (Dominican Republic) said that as his President has stated, “our country is shaken by the military invasion of Russia against the people of Ukraine”. The Russian Federation is violating the Charter of the United Nations, the Minsk agreements and the Budapest Memorandum, as well as countless resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. It is also violating the core principles of international law, including the commitment to resolve disputes through peaceful means and to refrain from the use of force, he said, calling for priority to be given to diplomatic negotiations. After the COVID-19 pandemic, the world does not want any further deaths and grief. “All countries, big and small, have the responsibility and the duty to respect the Charter of the United Nations,” he said, underscoring that “these values are non-negotiable”. He called on all nations to respect the wish of Ukraine to live in peace. “Today, humanity is waiting for us — let us not fail,” he said., SUNIL ALGRAM SITALDIN (Suriname) said the Russian Federation’s invasion of a sovereign and independent State cannot be accepted under any circumstances and must stop immediately. He urged all parties involved to engage responsibly and practice restraint to prevent destabilization of the region. Welcoming the start of a dialogue between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, he expressed hope that such talks would lead to the end of the war. Expressing concern about the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, he called on all parties to allow and facilitate the safe and unrestrained access of humanitarian assistance to those in need and to protect civilians, including those who are humanitarian personnel and persons in vulnerable situations. He said his country maintains diplomatic relations with both the Russian Federation and Ukraine and shall continue to commit itself to processes of dialogue and diplomacy, which are essential to democracy, peace, stability and security., NOOR QAMAR SULAIMAN (Brunei Darussalam), expressing concern over the escalation of tensions and military actions in Ukraine, said her country continues to monitor developments there. Condemning any violation of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of any country, she stressed the importance of upholding the principles of a rules-based framework and respect for international law. She called on all parties directly involved to de-escalate tensions and refrain from acts that may aggravate the situation further, and settle all differences by peaceful means, without resorting to the threat or use of force, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law, and in the interest of maintaining international peace and stability., ILANA VICTORYA SEID (Palau), associating herself with the Pacific Island Forum, said Ukraine and her country have little in common, yet there is a kinship because they “could be considered close siblings in the birth of nations” as they both became independent in the early 1990s. “If the turns of fate had one of our former colonizers act with the aggression of Russia towards us, citing the justification of historical unity, it would have been our people who would be suffering the atrocities of war we are seeing in Ukraine today,” she said. It might have been a Palauan woman who — on one of the most joyous days of her life — would be forced “to give birth in a bomb shelter against the booming noise of the missile strikes in the background”, she stated. Citing Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin’s self-proclaimed principle of historical unity, she noted the historical past is a part of the fabric of an integrated world, not a perverse excuse to wage an unprovoked war on neighbours. Indeed, Mr. Putin’s words are eerily reminiscent of Adolf Hitler’s justification for the annexation of Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia in the 1930s. Stressing that history shows the international community cannot make concessions to an aggressive power to avoid conflict, she called for all Member States to vote in favour of the resolution. “We cannot stand by as Russia looks to dismantle the rules-based world-order in pursuit of its own narrow self-interest,” she said., WALTON ALFONSO WEBSON (Antigua and Barbuda) said that on 8 February, his country’s Foreign Minister noted the importance of self-determination and sovereignty, and when those principles are threatened anywhere, the international community has the responsibility to speak out, “lest our silence be misconstrued as consent”. He said the security concerns of the Russian Federation do not justify any use of force or invasion, condemning them in the strongest way possible. Conflict plunges the world further into grave uncertainty while it is only now recovering from the effects of the pandemic. He cited a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) that small island States are suffering a 7.5 per cent rise in essential goods prices. “This is a crisis for all of us, and we all must speak out for diplomacy and support this resolution,” he stated. Noting the Security Council veto had been used selfishly, he called on all countries — especially small island States — to affirm that “might is not right”., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana), noting the gravity of the situation in Ukraine, said inaction on the part of the international community in roundly condemning the actions of the Russian Federation would further undermine the pillars “that have held our world together, regardless of its imperfection”. “Indeed, across this hall and throughout our Organization’s history, there is enough blame to go round,” he said, recalling that the Charter has been thrown out the window when it has suited powerful States. However, he warned against opening old wounds, which only creates fresh ones. Given the Security Council’s constraints, it is now the General Assembly’s responsibility to act. “From this hall, the Russian Federation must hear our call for an immediate ceasefire, a withdrawal of its troops from Ukraine and a recommitment to diplomacy and dialogue,” he said, adding that Moscow has been a longstanding friend to Ghana and “it takes true friendship to be candid with one another”., JANE J. CHIGIYAL (Federated States of Micronesia), aligning herself with the Pacific Islands Forum, underscored that this attack by a Member State on another is not a peacekeeping mission, but a war of aggression. “It is clear beyond any possible doubt who the aggressor is, and who the victim,” she said, adding: “War has a human face and there are no winners.” Against that backdrop, she called for the immediate cessation of hostilities and withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine’s sovereign territory. Further, she stressed that unhindered access to humanitarian assistance and safe passage must be provided to those seeking it. Noting that the principles enshrined within her country’s Constitution are closely related to those in the Charter of the United Nations, she expressed deep concern over the “abhorrent acts of the Russian Federation” and recalled that her Government has severed diplomatic relations with that country in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. She went on to urge parties to take the path of peaceful dialogue., MITCHELL FIFIELD (Australia), condemning the Russian Federation’s unprovoked, unjustified aggression against Ukraine, stressed that “there is no provocation and there is no just cause that Russia is seeking to pursue”. These are unilateral, hostile actions and, holding up a copy of the Charter of the United Nations, he said that, despite the obligation to maintain international peace and security, “Russia has chosen war”. Noting that Moscow has refused to engage in genuine dialogue over its security concerns, he added: “Let’s be clear — Russia is violating its obligations under the Charter.” In response, Australia has announced a range of sanctions imposing real costs on Moscow — reflecting the grave nature of the latter’s conduct — and has made monetary contributions to provide non-lethal equipment and humanitarian support to Ukraine. Canberra stands ready to help further as needs rise. He went on to call for the immediate withdrawal of the Russian military, the cessation of military action and a peace “that allows the people of Ukraine to live according to their own rules”., CAROLYN RODRIGUES-BIRKETT (Guyana), aligning herself with the statements given by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) on 14 and 24 February, said her country is gravely concerned about the Russian Federation’s recent military intervention, which violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. She called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a return to diplomacy. The Government of Guyana deplores the threat or use of force and urges a peaceful resolution of the current differences, in consensus with the rule of international law and the provisions of the Charter. The current military action in Ukraine is contrary to the principles of respect for territorial integrity, sovereignty and the non-interference in the internal affairs of another sovereign State. “The aggression against Ukraine is a threat to the region and countries everywhere,” she said. Guyana supports the Secretary-General’s efforts to bring a speedy resolution to the situation in Ukraine and cease the threat to international peace and security., BRIAN CHRISTOPHER MANLEY WALLACE (Jamaica) called for the immediate and complete withdrawal of Russian military forces from the territory of Ukraine, as that presence violates the principles enshrined in the Charter both in word and spirit — egregious actions, especially given its position as a permanent member of the Security Council, the very body mandated to maintain international peace and security. As a small island State, Jamaica recognizes that the international legal framework and the Charter are designed to provide a safe environment for all nations regardless of size or stature, and inaction by the international community would be unacceptable. Member States have “committed to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,” he said, and “the ongoing incursions in Ukraine are a violation of that sacred promise.” Expressing concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation, he called on all parties to ensure that displaced persons, both Ukrainian and non-citizens, are allowed safe and unfettered passage to their chosen destinations. “In the eternal and inspiring words of Bob Marley, therefore, let us all get up and stand up for the rights of all the people of Ukraine, because today — we are all Ukraine,” he said., OLIVIER MAES (Luxembourg), aligning himself with the European Union, said the Russian Federation’s brutal, unjustifiable, criminal ongoing aggression attacks the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and calls into question the principles of the United Nations and multilateralism. The Russian Federation’s veto on 25 February caused the Security Council to fail in discharging its mandate. The General Assembly must now fulfil its own responsibility. Noting Luxembourg’s co-sponsorship of the current draft resolution that, among other things, calls for the full withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine and peace talks to end the conflict, he said supporting it means voting to save lives. At this critical security juncture in Europe and the world, nothing justifies the use of nuclear weapons. Demanding that Belarus and the Russian Federation comply with international law, he said crimes must not go unpunished. Welcoming the International Criminal Court decision to launch an investigation and the Human Rights Council’s efforts to set up an inquiry, he called on the Russian Federation to comply with the recent European Court of Human Rights’ call on Moscow to stop the bombings. For its part, Luxembourg’s support includes contributing €1 million to humanitarian efforts, preparing to host refugees, providing medicine and equipment to Ukraine and imposing sanctions against the Russian Federation, he said, emphasizing that: “The fate of Ukraine is our fate; today, we are all Ukrainians.”, MAX HUFANEN RAI (Papua New Guinea), associating himself with the Pacific Island Forum, said this emergency session was convened only because the Security Council failed to live up to its core responsibilities. Disappointed at the failure of some entrusted Council members to uphold sacrosanct Charter principles, he said: “looking the other way is not what we expect” of them, given that they do not only represent their own delegations’ interests. It is times such as this that bring to the fore and underscore long overdue Council reform of the veto power and an archaic body that remains a prisoner of its past to the detriment of collective security, as has been regrettably witnessed in Ukraine, he said. Urging the Russian Federation to withdraw immediately from Ukraine, he welcomed ongoing efforts for dialogue. Rebuilding trust, confidence and mutual respect between all parties cannot be at the expense of accountability for actions and actors involved in the conflict. Calling for the safe passage of aid workers and supplies, he thanked neighbouring nations for opening borders and hearts to those seeking refuge. Papua New Guinea fully supports, endorses and co-sponsored the draft resolution, as it did for the Council resolution that was vetoed on 25 February and the “Uniting for Peace” resolution adopted two days later., SEBASTIANA BARROS (Timor-Leste) said her delegation co-sponsored the draft resolution based on its belief that the actions unfolding over the past days violate international humanitarian and human rights laws, escalating into a full war that has taken a heavy toll on the civilian population. Now it is the General Assembly’s duty to stand up and defend the core foundations of the United Nations. Recalling Timor-Leste’s experience of pain and suffering caused by a military attack, she said her country came from the ashes of forced occupation for years and knows that war brings benefits to no one. Urging all parties to the conflict to agree to an immediate ceasefire and pursue a diplomatic solution, she said that the Organization’s most crucial task is maintaining peace and security. At the same time, it must protect the civilian population and create conditions for peace, she said, thanking the Secretary-General and all United Nations agencies and partners for their continuous support to the civilian population through its humanitarian operation efforts., INGA RHONDA KING (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) cited the Russian Federation’s legitimate security concerns and perspective on the Donbas region and the need for diplomatic efforts thoroughly addressing them. However, the “special military operation” cannot reasonably be justified, as it will exacerbate human suffering across the globe, with no Member State immune from the ripple effect. Noting the existence of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as a sovereign and independent nation is owed to the international, sacrosanct norms and non-negotiable principles of the Charter, she urged strict adherence to them, reiterating calls by CARICOM and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) for the pacific settlement of disputes. While the Russian Federation has historically been a defender of the purposes and principles of the Charter, she unequivocally insisted that it immediately withdraw its forces from Ukraine. “History has taught us that peace is a great cause, and great causes have never been won by doubtful men or women,” she affirmed. She expressed dismay that people of African descent are being singled out unfairly as the refugee crisis unfolds, calling for equal fair treatment of all peoples., ISABELLE F. PICCO (Monaco), associating herself with the European Union, said that her country is committed to respect for international law and the Charter of the United Nations. In the General Assembly, where each State has one vote, Monaco will use its vote to support Ukraine. She expressed her grave concern that the population of Ukraine is being displaced as it flees violence. The situation is worsening rapidly and civilians are suffering, she said, emphasizing that “the Geneva conventions and their additional protocols impose a distinction between civilians and combatants and ban using civilians as targets”. Dialogue based on international law and the principles of the Charter is the only way to find an end to the war, she said, noting that her delegation will vote in favour of the resolution., AGUSTÍN SANTOS MARAVER (Spain), associating himself with the European Union, said that the General Assembly is meeting because the Security Council has been blocked by the Russian Federation’s veto. By exercising the veto, Moscow said it was doing so to balance the interest of the permanent members of the Council, he said, asking whether that balance — as interpreted by one member — is more important than the Charter of the United Nations. “Are some Member States more equal than others?” he questioned, stressing that “the veto is an anachronism — we must get rid of it.” The resolution that the General Assembly is debating has as its subject the sovereignty of Ukraine, the defence of peace and the diplomatic resolution of conflict, as well as “the very reason the United Nations exists”. He roundly condemned the invasion of Ukraine and expressed his admiration of those who were acting against the war. “Every minute of resistance makes the attackers self-justification vanish into thin air,” he said., ALFONSO GAHONA (Belize) said the Russian Federation’s attack on Ukraine is an attack on the Charter of the United Nations and an attack on the international system. Condemning that illegal attack and its gross violation of international law, he said his country does not recognize the “so-called Donetsk People’s republic or the so-called Luhansk People’s republic”. Expressing grave concern about the devastating impact of the war on Ukrainian lives, he underscored that the impact will be felt especially hard by women, the elderly and children. All States must respect and adhere to the principles of the Charter and the norms of international law, he said, calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of all Russian Federation troops and military hardware from Ukraine. He urged all sides to exercise restraint, comply with international humanitarian law and to resort to diplomacy to find a peaceful solution to the armed conflict, affirming his country’s solidarity with Ukraine and its people., MATHU JOYINI (South Africa) welcomed the commencement of talks between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, expressing hope that those discussions will lead to a diplomatic solution that will result in a sustainable political solution. She said the events of the last two weeks have again reminded Member States of the urgent need to reform the United Nations, especially the Security Council, which is long overdue. “We need a Council free from the legacy of the cold war so that it can genuinely be the space where the community of nations comes together to resolve conflict and build a more just and peaceful world,” she said. She urged the Council to utilize existing tools at its disposal in support of the peaceful settlement of disputes. Noting with concern that not all situations of conflict have received the same attention, she stressed that long-standing situations that the Security Council is seized with continue without resolution. “It is necessary that we devote equal attention to other long-standing conflicts where the United Nations Charter and human rights are being violated,” she said. Associating herself with the African Union Commission, she expressed concern about the treatment given to African nationals and people of African descent at the borders of Ukraine, some of whom are not allowed to cross and move to safety, urging European countries to take steps to resolve this situation as all people have a right to cross international borders during times of conflict., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) said that Member States must send a clear message to the peoples of world that the United Nations stands against war, unambiguously condemning the aggression against Ukraine and all wars of choice, for hegemony or resources. Expressing alarm at the severity of the situation, with blood flowing and people seeking refuge, he said that until the spectre of confrontation recedes, “we have the duty to offer an alternative to fear.” There is always time to choose diplomacy over force, he noted, calling for an immediate ceasefire and for warring factions to refrain from using any weapons with indiscriminate effect that threaten civilians. Echoing the alarm over African students in Ukraine facing discrimination in seeking shelter, he stressed: “We say no to racism and demand respect for human dignity.”, PEDRO LUIS PEDROSO CUESTA (Cuba) said his Government defends international law and will unambiguously support Latin America and the Caribbean as a zone of peace, as declared in 2014. He noted it is impossible to rigorously and honestly analyze the situation in Ukraine without considering factors that led to the use of force. The United States’ determination to extend the reach of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to Russian Federation borders has led to an unpredictable scenario which could have been avoided. Those movements in recent months, including the delivery of weapons into Ukraine, are the equivalent of a military pincer move, he said — and it was a mistake to ignore the Russian Federation’s demands for security guarantees, as it is impossible to achieve peace by surrounding and closing in on States. He similarly expressed concern over the first-time activation of the NATO response force. He recalled that in 1999, the United States and NATO launched an aggression against the former Yugoslavia, a European country they broke up at high human cost for geopolitical purposes. Washington and its allies have invaded sovereign States to trigger regime change and are responsible for hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths, described as “collateral damage” in wars of pillage and plunder. Turning to the draft resolution under consideration, he warned that the preceding document in the Council was not designed as a real search for solutions to the crisis, and the text submitted to the General Assembly suffers from the same deficiencies and lack of bounds, with no acknowledgement of the responsibility of those who took aggressive actions., FATUMANAVA-O-UPOLU III PA’OLELEI LUTERU (Samoa), aligning himself with the Pacific Island Forum, said that as a small island developing State, his country believes there are only a few global mechanisms to safeguard its security. Among them is a tool to ensure the maintenance of global peace and the respect for the rules-based international order. The main focus must be on the Charter’s preamble — saving generations from the scourge of war. Urging all actors to focus efforts on immediately ending hostilities, protect civilian and cease all military operations, he welcomed the current call by both Ukraine and the Russian Federation for peace talks. Echoing calls on the Russian Federation to respect Charter principles, abide by international law and fully honour the Minsk agreements, he said: “Let us all give peace a chance” and support the draft resolution., ENRIQUE AUSTRIA MANALO (Philippines) said his country will vote in favour of the resolution and condemns the invasion of Ukraine. He appealed for the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructures, urging the cessation of hostilities. Noting the growing humanitarian crisis, he stressed that safe access to humanitarian assistance must be assured by the most effective means. All States enjoy the right to full sovereignty in all their areas of jurisdiction, he said, condemning the use of separatism and secession as a weapon of diplomacy that invites and inflicts cruelties and indiscriminate killings. He strongly urged resorting to the 1982 Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes, noting that it would at least halt the ongoing tragedy for the time being., JÚLIO CÉSAR FREIRE DE MORAIS (Cabo Verde), warning that urban guerrilla warfare seems imminent amid the ongoing violence, said this is a pivotal moment for the United Nations and humanity. Commending efforts to address urgent humanitarian needs, he welcomed neighbouring countries’ offers to help. Cabo Verde unequivocally condemns the recourse to threat or the use of force in the relations between States and pledges for the respect of the values and international law, enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. In this regard, it reiterates the need to respect the sovereign equality, territorial integrity and inviolability of States. Being a small island developing State, Cabo Verde attaches paramount importance to the strict observance of the Charter´s principles and content. He declared: “Let us not fail tackling this serious challenge to multilateralism and prompt a response aiming to stop and revert the situation honouring the universality of the United Nations Charter.” No effort should be spared to establish an immediate ceasefire and seek a diplomatic way out through dialogue and negotiations for conflict resolution, under the provisions of the Minsk agreements, and in line with Security Council resolution 2202 (2015), he said, adding that ongoing direct talks in Belarus, although late, move in the right direction., ZSUZSANNA HORVÁTH (Hungary), aligning herself with the European Union, said that what is happening in Ukraine affects the security of every Member State, and strategic calmness is needed to avoid actions that can further escalate an already dire situation. War in neighbouring Ukraine is a great security risk for Hungary, which remains interested in achieving a peaceful conclusion to this conflict. The region has suffered because of conflict between powerful nations, she said, recalling the experience of the cold war. Welcoming news of direct talks, she expressed strong support for European Union and NATO unity and supported their joint responses as well as Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Special Monitoring Mission efforts. Hungary remains ready to receive refugees, its embassies are open and border crossings are operating in full capacity. Responding to requests from many nations in evacuating their citizens, Hungary has allowed entrance for all those fleeing war without restrictions or discrimination as to race, ethnicity, religion or country of origin, she said, adding that all cases of discrimination will be investigated and perpetrators held accountable. Calling for the immediate cessation of hostilities, she reiterated Hungary’s offer to host peace talks. Deeply worried by war in its neighbour’s country, and the consequences in the region, she reiterated support for a diplomatic solution. Hungary will vote in favour of the draft resolution, which is not about taking sides, but about upholding Charter principles., VANESSA FRAZIER (Malta), associating herself with the European Union, reiterated her country’s unwavering support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. Strongly condemning the unprovoked war launched by the Russian Federation — which is both illegal and unacceptable — she recalled that Malta joined a group of over 80 countries to co-sponsor the draft resolution tabled in the Security Council, which would have condemned the Russian Federation for its aggression and called for an end to the offensive. Describing Moscow’s veto of that draft as “disturbing”, she stressed the need to protect civilians and fully respect international law, while calling for the facilitation of rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian assistance to those in need. “It’s never too late for diplomacy,” she said, expressing hope that the Assembly will send a unanimous signal to the world defending the critical principles of sovereignty and independence of all Member States., SYED MOHAMAD HASRIN AIDID (Malaysia), expressing regret about the Security Council’s inability to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, recognized the legitimate security concerns of all parties. Nevertheless, all the parties must abide strictly by the principles of State sovereignty and territorial integrity. “In conflict situations, no solution can be found at the end of the barrel of a gun,” he said, calling instead for restraint and concrete steps to de-escalate the situation in favour of dialogue. He also voiced grave concern about reports that nuclear arsenals are being put on “high alert status” and recalled that Malaysia was the victim of the conflict in Ukraine when its flight MH17 was downed eight years ago, killing 298 innocent people. Against that backdrop, his delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution before the Assembly., MANSOUR AYYAD SH. A. ALOTAIBI (Kuwait), pointing out that the General Assembly meets today to discuss the Security Council’s “inability to discharge its duty to maintain peace and security in Europe and the world”, stressed that the multilateral system is in a delicate state. This situation represents a real test for the United Nations to defend the values and principles on which it was founded, and he welcomed negotiations held on 28 February between the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Belarus as a “glimmer of hope”. Given Kuwait’s painful experience of occupation in 1991, he underscored the need for States to abide by international law and the Charter of the United Nations, which represents a “safe haven for small States” and embodies the concept of collective security. Rejecting the threat or use of force in relations among States and expressing concern over the deteriorating situation in Ukraine, he urged all parties to respect their commitments under international law and Council resolutions that call for the defence of civilian populations and infrastructure., AGNES MARY CHIMBIRI MOLANDE (Malawi) reiterated his country’s commitment to global peace and security, recalling that as a peace-loving nation Malawi condemns any escalation that threatens that common cause. “The progress that has been realized in building the global peace and security architecture should be jealously guarded by all of us,” she stressed, also underlining the sanctity of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all Member States. At a time when the world is already grappling with several existential crises — ranging from the COVID-19 pandemic to climate change — restraint is all the more necessary. She called on the Russian Federation to immediately cease its fire and withdraw its forces from Ukraine in order to create conditions needed for continued diplomatic engagement and lasting peace, while noting that the crisis demands a show of leadership from the Security Council and all United Nations Member States in the true spirit of multilateralism., AMATLAIN ELIZABETH KABUA (Marshall Islands), associating herself with the Pacific Islands Forum, said the complete military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation is little more than a ruse to satisfy an imperialist agenda. “Free will and the rule of law are being overruled by the barrel of a gun,” she stated. Every democratic country in the world should be concerned “because an unlawful invasion of one of us is truly an unlawful invasion of all of us”. Calling the unprovoked invasion a “tyranny”, she warned that if the United Nations cannot take action, it risks its very relevance like the long-ago League of Nations. “Our population is small — but our voice can be very loud,” she affirmed, calling for the international community to speak out against flagrant wrongs “because if we fail to do so now, who will speak up for us or our neighbours in any future threats?” Expressing concern over the adequacy of multilateral response towards Ukraine, she stressed “a veto will not stop global consensus”, counselling that country to remain strong., NOA FURMAN (Israel) said that her country — having experienced many wars — knows first-hand that war is not the way to resolve conflict. The Russian attack on Ukraine is a serious violation of the international order. As such, she condemned the same and called on the Russian Federation to “heed the calls of the international community”, stop its attack and respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Given Israel’s deep ties with both countries, it stands ready to contribute to diplomatic efforts if so requested. Expressing concern over the growing humanitarian crisis, she said that her country will be providing humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine in the form of medical supplies, water purification systems, emergency-water-supply kits and winter gear. She went on to recall the words of the prophet Isaiah: “Nation shall not lift up sword against nation; neither shall they learn war anymore”., ELISENDA VIVES BALMAÑA (Andorra), aligning herself with the European Union, said that respect for international law must be at the heart of all States, big or small, in line with the founding Charter. Defending these and other principles, Andorra had co-sponsored the draft resolution to end violence in Ukraine, which was vetoed on 25 February in the Security Council. Indeed, the Council has failed its duty, so the General Assembly must now uphold its responsibility to ensure peace and security. As such, she urged all States to vote in favour of the Assembly’s draft resolution, which Andorra co-sponsored. There is no alternative to diplomacy, she stated, expressing serious concern over the current situation and calling on all parties to refrain from actions that violate the Charter. Parties must use every available tool to resolve the conflict, she said, adding that: “It is our responsibility to reduce tensions and address the suffering of the population.” Commending efforts to help the population, she said Andorra will contribute to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)., KACOU HOUADJA LÉON ADOM (Côte d’Ivoire) said his delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution, given that, amid the pandemic, this unacceptable crisis has been imposed on Ukraine. In doing so, Côte d’Ivoire will indicate its commitment to the independence of States and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Indeed, might does not make right, he said. Many efforts — including within the United Nations — have not helped to spare the world from another high-intensity conflict, he said, expressing serious concern about the ongoing conflict. Calling on parties to observe a ceasefire and give dialogue a chance, he said everything must be done to bring an end to this war. Calling on parties to respect humanitarian law, he appealed to the international community to mobilize needed resources to serve the needs of populations in distress. Raising concerns about reports that Côte d’Ivoire’s citizens are facing racist-tinged treatment and bullying, he asked that, if this is accurate, those countries involved show tolerance and respect., GHEORGHE LEUCĂ (Republic of Moldova), associating himself with the European Union, expressed his condemnation of the act of war launched by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. In six days, it has triggered a major humanitarian crisis in the region that has also affected neighbouring countries, including his own. Since the start of hostilities, about 95,000 refugees fleeing from Ukraine have entered the Republic of Moldova, he said, noting that the majority are women, children and the elderly. “To put this figure into perspective, given the difference in the size of the populations, such a flow would equal to about 2 million refuges entering a country with the population size of Germany in just five days,” he said. More than half of those decided to remain, he said, noting that his country is doing its best to cope with this situation but needs the support of its partners. In the coming days, the Republic of Moldova will be visited by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who will discuss ways to effectively respond to the humanitarian crisis. “Moldova will continue keeping our borders open for those who seek refuge,” he said., AMRIT BAHADUR RAI (Nepal) called on all parties in Ukraine to exercise maximum restraint and de-escalate tension immediately. Voicing concern about the safety of Nepali nationals currently in the country and requesting all those concerned to facilitate their safe passage, he warned that violence only breeds more violence. “Make no mistake, there is no alternative to the path of peace,” he stressed, urging the parties to walk the path of diplomacy and dialogue and to find a political solution as soon as possible. Spotlighting the Charter principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, he voiced Nepal’s opposition to any threat or use of force against a State “under any pretext and circumstances”., KEISHA ANIYA MCGUIRE (Grenada), associating herself with the Caribbean Community’s statement on 24 February and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States’ statement on 26 February, condemned the Russian Federation’s assault on the people of Ukraine, as well as its assault on the principles of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States, and on the provisions of international peace and stability, as enshrined in the Charter. The rule of law is not merely a priority, but also existential for many small States who are without a military, such as Grenada, serving as the sole shield to outside interference and/or attack. She called for an immediate end to the hostilities, reiterating the Caribbean Community’s call for “intensified diplomatic dialogue to immediately de-escalate hostilities and work towards sustainable peace”. Commending the neighbouring countries who are providing refuge to the victims of those hostilities, she called for strict adherence to international humanitarian law, including the unfettered passage for all those fleeing conflicts. Expressing concern about reports of disparate treatment of African nationals on the border of Ukraine who are encountering impediments as they desperately seek safety, she called on all States to adhere to their international obligations., SVEN ALKALAJ (Bosnia and Herzegovina), associating himself with the European Union, recalled the aggression suffered by his country where genocide was committed three decades ago, noting that the developing situation in Ukraine “resonates awfully close to home”. He called on both sides of the conflict to respect international humanitarian law and to guarantee unhindered and sustained access for humanitarian actors to all people in need. Bosnia and Herzegovina remains committed to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, he said, underscoring that the permanent members of the Security Council have a particular responsibility to uphold the Charter. He called on all international organizations, especially the international courts and tribunals, to closely monitor the developments on the ground and to assess any violations of international law, including international humanitarian law. The Security Council, which has the obligation and the general powers to maintain international peace and security, has, unfortunately, in this case failed so far. Nonetheless, negotiating peace must continue to be the objective above any military solution to the crisis. He affirmed Bosnia and Herzegovina’s vote in favour of the resolution, inviting all other Member States to do so., CHO HYUN (Republic of Korea) said the Assembly had gathered “in one of the darkest times in recent history”. This war was a choice made by the Russian Federation, which would not have taken place if it had listened to the calls of the international community. He urged that country to stop its offensive against Ukraine, immediately withdraw its military forces and for it to immediately reverse its decision on the status of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Expressing grave concern over the humanitarian situation, he said his Government will further increase its assistance to Ukraine. He noted the Republic of Korea was the first country that the United Nations assisted in response to an act of aggression, under the “Uniting for Peace” resolution — which forms the basis of today’s emergency special session. “My country still exists today because the peoples of the United Nations at the time stood up immediately to the cries of the innocent lives,” he stated. “This is why my delegation does not see the situation in Ukraine as some distant tragedy.” In that vein, the Republic of Korea still tries to maintain hope in the Organization’s system and the commitment of its Member States to uphold the principles of the Charter, resolutely standing united against this act of aggression., DENNIS FRANCIS (Trinidad and Tobago) said United Nations membership is a solemn undertaking to promote, support and devote one’s efforts to maintain and strengthen the rules-based order, as the foundation of international peace and security. That undertaking cannot legitimately be flouted or discarded at will, as if it were a matter of convenience. He said: “It is an obligation that as Member States we all share a duty to respect and to honour unconditionally.” The violation of Ukraine’s territory is a real threat to international peace and security, and creates a dangerous precedent, inimical to the vital security interests of small States like Trinidad and Tobago, which will never accept as legitimate or excusable such egregious violations of the Charter and international law. It is upon such laws and principles that his country and other small States, bereft of military arsenals, rely to guarantee their very existence as sovereign independent nations, he said, adding that: “For us, our suit of armour resides in the principles enshrined in the Charter and in the universal and unconditional acceptance of the basic tenets of international law by all members of the international community.” Condemning the ongoing violence, he called on the Russian Federation to recall its troops and return genuinely to the path of dialogue and diplomacy. Ongoing talks offer hope for de-escalation and warrant attention and support. Deeply concerned about the International Criminal Court’s announcement to launch an investigation into the alleged commission of war crimes, he called on both parties to respect and uphold their obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian law., SAMUEL MONCADA (Venezuela) noted his delegation had voted in favour of resolution 2202 (2015). Sadly, the Minsk agreements were wasted after seven years of violations within Ukraine, which widened the international divide — also heightened by the growing outside pressure of a steadily expanding NATO, with destructive effects on security architecture, especially for the Russian Federation. What arose as a violent national divide has escalated into a regional military crisis and is heading dangerously to the third level: an escalation between four nuclear Powers, with an economic blockade on one, which could lead to an international crisis. Security must prevail for all parties involved, to correct the current path and “avoid the point of no return”. He affirmed the United Nations as the only institution in the world with the capacity, experience and instruments required to reach peaceful settlement of disputes at this level. Rejecting the implementation of unilateral and retaliatory measures which will heighten tensions and prolong the conflict, he condemned a deliberately generated crisis intended to destabilize a nuclear Power. “This is not the path to peace,” he stressed, as the security of one country cannot jeopardize another. As NATO cannot continue to expand and destabilize the planet, he called for direct talks on equal footing between the Russian Federation and that organization. He appealed for an end to war propaganda to “avoid a chain reaction which will lead us walking mindlessly into the abyss”., HOANG GIANG DANG (Viet Nam), recalling his nation’s history of enduring war, stressed that conflicts today stem from “obsolete doctrines of power politics, the ambition of domination and the use of force in settling international disputes”. Viet Nam understands first-hand that, once war breaks out, it only causes endless suffering. Against that backdrop, he underscored the importance of respect for international law and the Charter of the United Nations and stressed that all international disputes must be resolved by peaceful means. All States — large and small — must adhere to the fundamental principles of sovereign equality, respect for the political independence and territorial integrity of States, non-interference in the internal affairs of States and refrainment from the threat or use of force. Expressing concern over the ongoing armed conflict in Ukraine — a sovereign Member State — he called on all concerned parties to de-escalate tensions and resume dialogue through all channels to reach a solution that accounts for the concerns of all parties., MARÍA DEL CARMEN SQUEFF (Argentina), noting that today’s meeting is to defend the founding principles of the United Nations, underscored that “the situation in Ukraine cannot be cast aside”. She condemned the invasion of Ukraine and called on the Russian Federation to immediately cease its illegitimate use of force and military operations in Ukrainian territory. Recalling the Secretary-General’s message of concern relating to the Russian Federation’s decision to put its nuclear forces on alert, she spotlighted the clear principles governing weapons of mass destruction. While Argentina defends the peaceful use of nuclear energy, the international community must work towards “complete destruction of a weapon that threatens the planet with total annihilation”. She went on to stress that no acquisition of land can be recognized as legal when done through the threat or use of force — this is a logical consequence of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. Adding that international law contains general principles recognized by the international community, she said that States “do not have the luxury of choosing when they are applicable or not”., ANTJE LEENDERTSE, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, recalling the birth of a girl named Mia days ago amid rocket attacks and fear, said the Russian Federation’s actions are the reason for the current situation. The vote for the Assembly’s draft resolution is about Mia. Noting that she herself grew up amid peace and security in Europe, she recalled that it was Nazi Germany that launched the brutal Second World War, leading to the founding of the United Nations, whose goal was that she and future generations could live in peace. The Russian Federation has brutally attacked this order. The war is about Ukraine and “it is about all of us” that marks the dawn of a new era. Today, there is a new reality that President Putin has forced upon the world. This war of aggression is based on lies, repeated today by the Russian Federation’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the Human Rights Council, she said, responding to his claims of self-defence by stating that: “The whole world is watching as you are bombing the homes of Russian-speaking Ukrainians […] and your tanks are not carrying water, but death and destruction; you are using your power as a permanent member of the Security Council; you can deceive yourself, but you will not deceive us or your own people.”, She said the Russian Federation’s war marks a new reality, requiring all States to make firm decisions and take a side. Germany is stepping up support, providing food, aid and shelter for refugees. Pointing to rumours that those fleeing from Ukraine who are of African descent are being discriminated against at the European Union borders, she recalled a recent visit to Poland, where she had made it clear that every refugee must receive protection no matter their nationality, origin or skin colour. Germany has also decided to support Ukraine militarily to protect itself, in line with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. Germany is deeply aware of its historic responsibly and will always be committed to diplomacy and seeking out peaceful solutions. But, when peaceful approaches come under attack, “we must act responsibly and unite for peace”, she said, adding that: “Now, we all have to choose between peace and aggression, between justice and the will of the strongest, between taking action and turning a blind eye,” she said, encouraging all States to vote in favour of the draft resolution. When Member States cast their votes, she said each will have to go home and look their loved ones in the eye and tell them what choice they made., SURIYA CHINDAWONGSE (Thailand), condemning the ongoing conflict, said his delegation will do its utmost to help Ukrainian citizens. Thailand remains committed to the principles of international law, including refraining from the use of force against another State. Calling for a cessation of hostilities, he said continued violence will have widespread consequences across the world. Renewing a call for dialogue, he said a sustainable solution must be found through the United Nations and existing mechanisms. Welcoming peace talks, he said Thailand believes the path of peace, reconciliation and good neighbourliness will ultimately prevail., ABDOU ABARRY (Niger) said that when the United Nations was created in 1945 in San Francisco following the horrors of the Second World War, it was primary to save future generations from the scourge of war. The situation in Ukraine jeopardizes the San Francisco consensus and is a test of the viability of the system. The use of force by the Russian Federation is an act that Niger condemns, he said, noting that his country will vote in favour of the resolution. The Security Council has not been able to act because of the use of the veto by one of its members. Faced with this aggression against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, the international community should do everything it can to save peace at any cost. Peace in this region must go beyond the non-aggression pact — of which the limits can now be seen — and must become a genuine pact of all States. He welcomed the commencement of a dialogue between the parties, he said, stressing that they should do everything to spare civilians from undue suffering. The good offices of the Secretary-General would be an inestimable contribution to this process, he said., JAIME HERMIDA CASTILLO (Nicaragua) reiterated his commitment to sovereignty and territorial integrity for all countries. Member States must comply with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, he said, noting that this applies to all States equally. His Government believes that negotiations between the two parties are key, in order to ramp up diplomatic efforts and guarantee peace and security. NATO has insisted on disregarding the agreements adopted by the Russian Federation following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he said. He rejects the use of unilateral measures such as political or economic sanctions, including those being launched against the Russian Federation by the United States and NATO when they are sending weapons to Ukraine. All this escalation does is fuel war and leave in its wake death, causalities and migration of families. It is not through policies of double standards that a world of peace will be built, but through diplomatic efforts and solutions., ION JINGA (Romania), associating himself with the European Union, said the entire world is being threatened by the Russian Federation’s actions in Ukraine, as well as its decision to put its nuclear arsenal on high alert. Romania stands with the Ukrainian people, including by hosting those who are fleeing across borders, and strongly condemns Moscow’s irresponsible behaviour in violating its commitments under the Charter. Moscow must cease its use of force and withdraw immediately and unconditionally all its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. Romania also supports the ambitious package of extended sanctions imposed by many States on Moscow, including the closure of European Union airspace to Russian Federation aircrafts and contributions of assistance aimed to bolster Ukraine’s military capacity, he said., DRAGANA ŠĆEPANOVIĆ (Montenegro), associating herself with the European Union, said the Assembly is meeting in response to the Russian Federation’s flagrant violation of the Charter, of international law, and of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. That unjustified and unprovoked military aggression puts millions of lives at risk and represents a clear and present threat to peace and security, both in Europe and beyond. Condemning those acts and calling for their immediate end, she also demanded an end to dangerous rhetoric, which can only lead to further escalation and increases the risk of catastrophic miscalculation. Regrettably, the Security Council failed its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security due to the veto cast last week by one permanent member. Reiterating that the only solution to the crisis is through diplomatic means, she went on to call on all international actors to pay special attention to preserving stability and security in the Western Balkans, a region which cherishes European and Euro-Atlantic values and principles., DAMIANO BELEFFI (San Marino), associating himself with the European Union, called upon the parties to immediately stop the war in Ukraine, which is jeopardizing international peace and security on a global scale. Reiterating his country’s support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and independence of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, he also called for a return to dialogue leading to a negotiated solution. Noting that San Marino historically only adopts and implements sanctions endorsed by the Security Council, he said that on 28 February the Government initiated a legislative procedure to allow the adoption of additional sanctions, given the gravity of the situation in Ukraine. He also spotlighted the urgent need for humanitarian assistance, deploring and condemning acts of aggression against civilian infrastructure and demanding that the parties strictly uphold international humanitarian and human rights law. Against that backdrop, San Marino has co-sponsored and will vote in favour of the draft resolution before the Assembly, in solidarity with the Ukrainian people., ANDREAS HADJICHRYSANTHOU (Cyprus), associating himself with the European Union, condemned the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine, stating the use of force is “the repudiation of the principles that every country in this Hall has committed to uphold”. As a small State, which relies on the global rules-based order for its security, Cyprus is concerned about the effectiveness of that collective system. He deplored the human suffering, loss of life, and massive displacement caused by the hostilities — “a consequence of war that Cyprus is only too familiar with for nearly 50 years now”. Calling for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian military forces, he further expressed deep concern over the current level of nuclear threat: “There are no victors with nuclear weapons — only victims.” Noting Cyprus itself is a victim of foreign invasion and ongoing occupation, and the situation in Ukraine constitutes a flagrant violation of international law, he continued: “There is only one way out: diplomacy, not war.”, FRANCISCO DUARTE LOPES (Portugal), associating himself with the European Union, strongly condemned the unprovoked aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine, which must immediately withdraw its military forces. He expressed regret over the loss of lives and mounting human suffering, with more and more internally displaced persons and refugees in need of assistance. Hailing the generosity and solidarity shown by Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and the Republic of Moldova in hosting and assisting those fleeing from the scourge of war, he reiterated Portugal’s readiness to welcome Ukrainians who wish to continue their lives in his country. The draft resolution is a timely and necessary step, he said, justified by the increasingly dire situation faced by Ukraine, encouraging Member States to vote in favour. Urging the Russian Federation to abandon its military offensive and participate constructively in negotiations with Ukraine, he quoted the Secretary-General: “It is never too late to engage in good-faith negotiations and to address all issues peacefully”., KIM SONG (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) said that the root cause of the Ukraine crisis lies in the hegemonic policy of the United States and the West, which “indulge themselves in high-handedness and arbitrariness towards other countries”. Those States have systematically undermined the European security environment by defying the Russian Federation’s reasonable demand for legal security guarantees and pursuing NATO’s eastward expansion. Recalling the violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya by the United States and the West under the pretext of international peace and security, he said that it is “absurd” for such countries to mention respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity in the context of the Ukrainian situation. It is characteristic of the current international order that “seeds of discord are sown” in every region where the United States intervenes, and he added that reality proves clearly, once again, that peace will never settle in the world so long as the United States continues its “unilateral and double-dealing policy”., NGOSA SIMBYAKULA (Zambia), expressing concern over the deteriorating situation in Ukraine, called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and for the two parties concerned to seek a peaceful solution to the current conflict. “The military aggression by the Russian Federation in Ukraine is regrettable and should be discontinued,” he added. Welcoming the recent meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations as a “step in the right direction”, he underscored that all international actors are obliged to respect international law and uphold the Charter of the United Nations. He went on to call on the Russian Federation and Ukraine to agree to an immediate ceasefire in line with the same, while stressing the need for both parties to prevent any further displacement or loss of human life or property within Ukraine. For its part, Zambia will support the draft resolution, he noted., MD MONWAR HOSSAIN (Bangladesh), echoing expressions of support for the Charter principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, also called for restraint on the part of all actors. Voicing full support and confidence in the Secretary-General’s good offices, he called on him to urgently engage the parties in dialogue, while underlining the need to facilitate safe and unimpeded humanitarian access and to allow safe passage for all those seeking to leave Ukraine., DUSHKO UZUNOVSKI (North Macedonia), associating himself with the European Union and reaffirming his country’s support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, noted that his nation co-sponsored the draft resolution currently before the Assembly. “We fully support the text and every word in it,” he said, calling upon all peace-loving nations to vote in favour. Describing the unprovoked aggression against Ukraine as a blatant violation of international law and the principles enshrined in the Charter, he strongly condemned Moscow’s decision to “opt for the path of war”, which is causing loss of life and devastating infrastructure damage. Voicing grave concern about the Russian Federation’s announcement that it is ready to raise the nuclear alert level and about attacks on such facilities as kindergartens, schools and hospitals, he urged States to vote in favour of the Assembly’s draft resolution, declaring: “Today, the free world is renouncing the acts of aggression and we should stand united against this wrongdoing.”, ODO TEVI (Vanuatu), associating himself with the Pacific Island Forum, said the Security Council’s failure to adopt the Ukraine-Russian Federation resolution reveals that organ’s shortcomings. With its universal membership — which includes small States such as Vanuatu — the Assembly can provide perspective on the situation and express countries’ solidarity with the people and Government of Ukraine. “As a small State, Vanuatu does not have a military might nor nuclear weapons,” he said, but the country believes in the international rule of law and the right to self-determination. Calling for safe humanitarian access to all affected areas, he added that the rights to food, water, shelter and medicine must also be guaranteed and the rights of minorities — including people of African descent — must be protected., ANTONIO RODRIGUE (Haiti) said that one of the primary purposes of the United Nations is the maintenance of international peace and security. This noble goal is of particular importance not just today, but for future generations. The painful situation unfolding in Ukraine is extremely worrisome and is a very serious threat to global peace, security and stability. The global community must work together, particularly after the decision by Moscow to set its nuclear weapons on high alert. In a statement on 23 February 2022, the Government of Haiti urged the parties concerned to exercise constraint. He appealed for further diplomatic efforts towards a peaceful solution and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The war has already cost lives and caused considerable damage in Ukraine, he said, noting that Haiti will vote in favour of the resolution., VILIAMI VA'INGA TŌNĒ (Tonga), associating himself with the Pacific Islands Forum and voicing solidarity with Ukraine, expressed support for the draft resolution before the Assembly. As a small island country attempting to recover from a recent natural disaster — namely, the unprecedented volcanic eruption and tsunami that occurred on 15 January — Tonga knows what it is like to face circumstances beyond national control, as is also the case in Ukraine today. He called on that country’s partners to continue to support its people and on Member States to uphold the principles of the United Nations Charter. For those reasons, Tonga has co-sponsored the draft resolution currently before the Assembly and will vote in favour of that text, in support of Ukraine and against the Russian Federation’s aggression., VICTORIA LIETA LIOLOCHA (Democratic Republic of the Congo) said respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all countries by all Member States is a fundamental element for peace and international security. “This is a golden rule — an intangible rule that all members of the United Nations must respect at all times and in all places,” she said. Due to its own experience, her country can in no way sanction the violation of the territorial sovereignty and integrity of any Member State and of Ukraine in particular. Commending all efforts aimed at encouraging dialogue and opening a path to diplomatic negotiations, she said the path of de-escalation and choice of diplomacy remains an important option that should be explored. As the repercussions of the situation could destabilize the fragile balance in eastern Europe and beyond, the international community must look at the humanitarian and economic consequences that could follow. She welcomed the international solidarity that has allowed Ukraine’s neighbouring countries to open their borders, welcome displaced persons and provide necessary assistance. “We want this expression of empathy to displaced persons without discrimination,” she said. Her country joins the voices of the international community represented in the room in calling for peace and asking the two parties to return to the negotiating table., NNAMDI OKECHUKWU NZE (Nigeria) said the violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, or of any other nation, including any illegal occupation and annexation, is unacceptable. Noting the implications of the invasion on the people of Ukraine, he stressed the importance of direct talks between the parties involved, as well as the responsibility of all parties to protect the civilian population. He urged the Russian Federation to halt all military action and “revert to status quo”. Moreover, he appealed for negotiations to be held in good faith, with the United Nations playing a prominent role. Countries with influence on the parties should redouble their diplomatic and related efforts to bring the conflict to a mutually satisfying end for both parties. All actions that threaten sovereignty and territorial integrity, as recognized in international law, must be stopped., JOYKER NAYECK, (Mauritius) noted that his small island State is among the very few countries in the world which does not possess an army, and therefore expressed deep concern over the unfolding situation in Ukraine. Deploring the loss of lives, damage to civilian infrastructure and the increasing number of internally displaced persons impacting the region, he affirmed that the threat or use of force against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or independence of any State is inconsistent with the Charter and principles of the United Nations — which came into being with the sacrosanct mission of maintaining international peace and security and must collectively strive to keep this century free from the cycle of violence. “No matter what part of the world we are from, we are all basically the same human being,” trying to seek peace and avoid suffering, he said. Describing “a defining moment for our Organization”, he called for de-escalation, dialogue and negotiations. “Let us stand united in our resolve for lasting peace,” he said., TAREK LADEB (Tunisia) expressed regret over the implications of the current situation for Europe and the world. Voicing hope that the international community will find a solution to the crisis, he called on all parties to reach a ceasefire and stop the escalation. More efforts must be deployed towards dialogue and constructively working towards long-lasting settlement. Noting the Minsk agreements, adopted under Security Council resolution 2202 (2015), remain one option to overcome the problem, he called for them to be activated. Recalling that the United Nations was established in 1945 to save future generations from the scourge of war, he reaffirmed support for the principles of Charter, which are essential to maintaining peace and security in the world., ALYA AHMED SAIF AL-THANI (Qatar), noting that the draft resolution on which this meeting is based refers to the twin objectives of maintaining international peace and security and developing friendly relations among States, underscored that all efforts must be deployed to realize the same. She urged all parties to exercise restraint and pursue peaceful, diplomatic means to resolve the conflict. Qatari foreign policy is based on the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations; namely, refraining from the threat or use of force against the political independence and territorial integrity of States. As such, she emphasized the territorial integrity and unity of Ukraine within its recognized borders. The present crisis must be settled by pursuing negotiation within the ambit of international law and the Charter to satisfy the concerns of all parties. She went on to call on all parties to fulfil their obligations under international humanitarian law and secure the safe, unhindered deployment of humanitarian assistance., For information media.

Protection of civilians in Ukraine conflict,News and Press Release,Oxfam,Protection and Human Rights,1 Mar 2022,"As a humanitarian organization, Oxfam is horrified by the loss of life being witnessed, and gravely concerned by the impacts of the conflict in Ukraine.  We call for an immediate end to hostilities. The protection of life is of paramount importance. It is vital that civilians everywhere are safeguarded and we stand in solidarity with all those affected by violence, wherever they may be. , The protection of civilians must be assured: respect for international law and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations are vital to preserve peace. All Members of the United Nations must redouble their commitment to “settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered” as the UN Charter requires.   , In any conflict it is always the most vulnerable people who are the worst affected. As conflict and its consequences ravage economies, it is people living in poverty, on both sides, who will lose their jobs and their access to services, and who will struggle most to cope with daily life. As ordinary men and women are pulled into a conflict they do not want, children and the elderly will be left without support.  , As of today, the UN estimates that 386,000 people have already fled Ukraine into Poland, Hungary, Romania, Moldova and other surrounding countries. Without peace, these numbers will sharply increase as people are displaced both internally and outside of Ukraine’s borders.  , All people have the right to flee from conflict, and to seek asylum in safe countries. As countries bordering Ukraine receive tens of thousands of asylum seekers, Oxfam appeals to all governments to ensure that they find safe refuge. This must apply equally to all people fleeing conflict, whether from Ukraine, or to those in Yemen and Afghanistan and beyond.

Joint IMF-World Bank Group Statement on the War in Ukraine [EN/AR/RU/UK/ZH],News and Press Release,IMF,"Education
Health",1 Mar 2022,"WASHINGTON, Mar. 1, 2022 – International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank Group President David Malpass today issued the following statement on the war in Ukraine., “We are deeply shocked and saddened by the devastating human and economic toll brought by the war in Ukraine. People are being killed, injured, and forced to flee, and massive damage is caused to the country’s physical infrastructure. We stand with the Ukrainian people through these horrifying developments. The war is also creating significant spillovers to other countries. Commodity prices are being driven higher and risk further fueling inflation, which hits the poor the hardest. Disruptions in financial markets will continue to worsen should the conflict persist. The sanctions announced over the last few days will also have a significant economic impact. We are assessing the situation and discussing appropriate policy responses with our international partners., “Our institutions are working together to support Ukraine on the financing and policy fronts and are urgently increasing that support. We have been in daily contact with the authorities on crisis measures. At the IMF, we are responding to Ukraine’s request for emergency financing through the Rapid Financing Instrument, which our Board could consider as early as next week. In addition, we continue to work on Ukraine’s Stand-By Arrangement program, under which an additional $2.2 billion is available between now and the end of June. At the World Bank Group, we are preparing a $3 billion package of support in the coming months, starting with a fast-disbursing budget support operation for at least $350 million that will be submitted to the Board for approval this week, followed by $200 million in fast-disbursing support for health and education. This package will include the mobilization of financing from several development partners, and we welcome the already-announced support from many bilateral partners., “The World Bank and the IMF are also working together to assess the economic and financial impact of the conflict and refugees on other countries in the region and the world. We stand ready to provide enhanced policy, technical, and financial support to neighboring countries as needed. Coordinated international action will be crucial to mitigate risks and navigate the treacherous period ahead. This crisis affects the lives and livelihoods of people around the world, and we offer them our full support.”, Contacts, Washington, D.C.

People are being killed, injured, and forced to flee, and massive damage is caused to the country’s physical infrastructure. We stand with the Ukrainian people through these horrifying developments. The war is also creating significant spillovers to other countries. Commodity prices are being driven higher and risk further fueling inflation, which hits the poor the hardest. Disruptions in financial markets will continue to worsen should the conflict persist. The sanctions announced over the last few days will also have a significant economic impact. We are assessing the situation and discussing appropriate policy responses with our international partners., “Our institutions are working together to support Ukraine on the financing and policy fronts and are urgently increasing that support. We have been in daily contact with the authorities on crisis measures. At the IMF, we are responding to Ukraine’s request for emergency financing through the Rapid Financing Instrument, which our Board could consider as early as next week. In addition, we continue to work on Ukraine’s Stand-By Arrangement program, under which an additional $2.2 billion is available between now and the end of June. At the World Bank Group, we are preparing a $3 billion package of support in the coming months, starting with a fast-disbursing budget support operation for at least $350 million that will be submitted to the Board for approval this week, followed by $200 million in fast-disbursing support for health and education. This package will include the mobilization of financing from several development partners, and we welcome the already-announced support from many bilateral partners., “The World Bank and the IMF are also working together to assess the economic and financial impact of the conflict and refugees on other countries in the region and the world. We stand ready to provide enhanced policy, technical, and financial support to neighboring countries as needed. Coordinated international action will be crucial to mitigate risks and navigate the treacherous period ahead. This crisis affects the lives and livelihoods of people around the world, and we offer them our full support.”, Contacts, Washington, D.C.

This aid was acquired from Rohlik.cz, Tesco, Bidfood and Alza.cz either completely free or at a great discount., The PIN team has arrived in Lviv, where the humanitarian situation is expected to start deteriorating rapidly. Tens of thousands of internally displaced people are flocking to this western Ukrainian city while sirens signal the threat of Russian attack. Our employees stationed in Lviv are safe and ready to provide aid., Another team from PIN arrived on the Slovak border on Saturday, working with other organizations to provide support to those waiting for safe crossing. Aid, transportation, and shelter—such as insulated tents for displaced children—are key resources along the border. PIN staff has also organized assistance at the Romanian border near Moldova, where multi-kilometer queues are forming as people wait to cross. In this region, the displaced people of Ukraine lack basic needs such as food, water, and hygiene products., Together with a consortium of NGOs working with migrants, we launched a portal for matching offers and requests for assistance to Ukraine. At the PIN helpline, SOS Ukraine accepts calls from over a thousand people a day as they either offer or request aid., Help for Lviv, The first convoy carries material aid worth over 10 million CZK, but preparations are already underway for the handling of other convoys. ""We help and will help as much as possible. That is why we are glad that we were able to connect with PIN and donate the necessary food and hygiene items that will go to Ukraine, ""says Olin Novák, director of Rohlík.cz, Three trucks left Prague, the other two loaded goods in warehouses in Slovakia. We planned to cross the Ukrainian border together on Monday morning., ""The needs of Ukraine are huge. We are sending the first convoy of humanitarian aid to Lviv, which requested it, and we will continue deliveries in trucks and by rail.

Targeted assistance will also be supplied to other areas of Ukraine., Border assistance, The team from the Czech Republic arrived on the Slovak border on Saturday, where they managed to secure access to the Ukrainian side. Queues stretching kilometers are forming at border crossings and basic needs are missing on the Ukrainian side: food, water, and hygiene. ""Together with our partner People in Need Slovakia, we are supplying mobile toilets, building insulated tents for children, and preparing food distribution for people who are forced to wait in long queues. We have also contacted the mayor of Velykiy Berezniy and are coordinating assistance to people who are gathering at the border. We expect that the number of refugees will increase in the coming days,"" Marek Štys, head of humanitarian aid at PIN, tells us from the ground in Ukraine., Another team has begun working in the Romanian city of Iași, where a large number of Ukrainian refugees are flowing through. PIN is working with local associations to organize assistance, supporting them financially and helping them build capacity, as many organizations in the region have no experience supplying humanitarian aid. ""We also want to help people with special needs, such as children and the elderly,” says PIN coordinator Elena Terzi, “Sometimes it happens that someone brings only children to the border. The father must be in the military and the mother is in a critical state. They choose to stay in Ukraine and try to send their children to safety."", An additional PIN team is in Moldova, heading for the Ukrainian border., Over a thousand people call every day, Since the beginning of the invasion, more than a thousand people have been calling the SOS Ukraine helpline every day. ""In the evening and at night, people call while under fire in Ukraine— from shelters and cellars— who want to help with the evacuation or cry on the phone,” says helpline coordinator Veronika Gabrielová, “In the morning, people call from the border crossings, Ukrainians who worked in the Czech Republic call, family members who have relatives in Ukraine call. During the day, people call for help, people who want to help but don’t know how to. Companies, cities, institutions, benefit organizers, and the like also offer their help,” adds Gabrielová., People in Need does not organize volunteers or public material collections itself and instead coordinates to help other NGOs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/first-three-trucks-carrying-humanitarian-aid-en-route-ukraine-two-more-will-join

The humanitarian situation in Ukraine is getting worse by the hour. “People in Need”, CARE Austria’s partner organization, is providing assistance as quickly as possible. The first trucks with relief supplies are already on their way to Ukraine. They are transporting durable food, hygiene items, diapers, sleeping bags and mats., In recent days, more than 500,000 people fled Ukraine for neighboring countries. This number is expected to rise to more than one million in the next 48 hours. “We hope that people here will be willing to donate, because the need for help for the people in Ukraine and those who have fled to neighboring countries is enormous,” said Andrea Barschdorf-Hager, executive director of CARE Austria., An emergency relief team from “People in Need” is in Lviv. Tens of thousands of refugees are pouring into the western Ukrainian city as sirens are blaring and are warning about the threat of a Russian attack. “We expect the number of refugees to increase in the coming days,” Marek Štys, head of humanitarian aid at “People in Need”, reports from Ukraine., Other emergency workers from the organization are working on the Slovak border. They are working with other humanitarian organizations to support people waiting to cross the border safely. Relief supplies, transportation, and shelter – such as isolated tents for the many children among the refugees – are available at the border., Help is also needed at the Romanian border near Moldova. Here, people wait in lines that stretch for miles. There is a lack of water, food and hygiene items. At all border crossings from Ukraine to neighboring countries, relief supplies are urgently needed, as well as sanitary facilities such as mobile toilets., Recently, children have been sent across the border alone. “The parents decide to stay in Ukraine but want to bring the children to safety,” says an emergency worker from “People in Need”., For More Information:, Dorissa White

The war in Ukraine and the renaissance of temporary protection - why this might be the only way to go,News and Press Release,ICMPD,Protection and Human Rights,2 Mar 2022,"This Thursday, 3 March 2022, an Extraordinary Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council meeting is expected to vote on a proposal by the European Commission to activate the EU’s Temporary Protection Directive for the first time for people fleeing the war in Ukraine. There are good reasons to do so., With the war in Ukraine ongoing at a larger scale than anyone expected, many Ukrainians are forced to seek protection in neighbouring countries. The severity with which the Russian military is hitting all parts of Ukraine raises concerns of forced displacement on a scale unprecedented in Europe’s recent history. In less than a week, 874,000 people have already left Ukraine (as of 2 March) The neighbouring EU countries, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania, have already shown a remarkably quick and unbureaucratic response, opening their borders and allowing people to enter. While immediate protection from physical harm is undoubtedly the most important aim, the decision on people’s legal status within the EU is and will be important, as it also determines their rights., While it is true that Ukrainians can enter the EU visa-free, this does not come with any rights. The visa-free regime is designed for short-term stays (up to 90 days) in the EU, mainly for touristic reasons or short visits. This certainly gives Ukrainians an important right to enter and stay in EU countries – a right that most other refugees who arrived in the EU in the past, like Afghans, Syrians, or Eritreans, cannot lean on. However, it does not allow access to any services, and particularly important amidst the ongoing pandemic, does not include any insurance for medical needs. Additionally, the visa-free regime only applies to Ukrainian nationals and not to citizens of other countries who resided in Ukraine, such as foreign students, stateless people, or people who were granted refugee status in Ukraine, who also needed to flee amid the outbreak of war., What protection is available?, The EU has been building its Common European Asylum System (CEAS) since 1999 to harmonise and standardise it across all 27 EU Member States. Essentially, these standards determine who shall receive protection and what rights come with this protection. The CEAS has three different statuses available for people in need of protection, which vary in their suitability for receiving refugees from Ukraine:, The most-known instrument is refugee protection, which is the strongest form of protection, as it comes with far-reaching rights similar to those of citizens. It guarantees a right to stay for at least 3 years, access to services, family reunification, the right to work, and education. However, refugee protection in the EU essentially follows a persecution-centred logic. In accordance with the 1951 Refugee Convention, the CEAS applies this protection to a person who has a well-founded fear of persecution for at least one of five reasons (race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group) and is outside the country of origin. Situations of indiscriminate violence like the war in Ukraine, which targets the general population at random, do not (necessarily) satisfy this persecution-centred logic., In 2004, the EU decided to close this protection gap by introducing a subsidiary protection status. Among other reasons, subsidiary protection addresses situations of serious and individual threats to persons facing indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict. The ongoing war in Ukraine certainly satisfies such a definition. Subsidiary protection also comes with broad rights, although they are less than those offered to people with refugee status. Its duration is usually shorter (at least 1 year, renewable) and it comes with access to work and other services and more limited rights for family reunification., Both refugee and subsidiary protection are established by EU Member States in tedious and often long-lasting, individualised procedures to assess whether or not a person fulfils the criteria. The procedure would last even longer if high numbers of applicants enter the system within a short time. When the war in former Yugoslavia in the 1990s forced thousands of Bosnians to flee, countries like Austria or Germany soon saw their asylum systems collapsing. Lacking any appropriate instrument that could provide ad hoc protection to so many people, countries like Austria granted “temporary stay” to Bosnians, which ultimately served as a blueprint for the first EU asylum directive, the Temporary Protection Directive, in 2001., Temporary protection – the EU instrument for a “mass influx”, While EU Member States have granted refugee or subsidiary protection status to thousands of people in need over the last two decades, no one was ever granted temporary protection according to the Temporary Protection Directive. This is because this instrument has never been triggered. For the Directive to be triggered, the Council must agree on a proposal by the Commission with a majority vote (at least 15 Member States that represent at least 65% of the EU population). There were some attempts in the past to draw on this instrument – in 2011, when many people crossed the Mediterranean from North African countries in the wake of the Arab Spring, and more prominently in the context of high numbers of refugee and migrant arrivals in 2015-2016 and the recent flight of Afghans following the Taliban takeover in August 2021. Still, the calls did not find enough support to trigger the instrument, and the Directive has been broadly labelled dead law. Now, with hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians arriving in eastern EU countries, this instrument may experience an unexpected renaissance., The complex process of triggering this instrument, however, was not the only reason that temporary protection remained unused. The lack of a common understanding of how to define “mass influx” and the fear of creating a pull effect that would result in even more arrivals were two other key factors in the decision. The latter argument, which as yet lacks evidence, might have had its merits in other contexts. Fast-tracked protection for Afghans in 2021 or Syrians in 2015-2016, for instance, could have attracted more refugees to make their way to the EU. In the current context, however, Ukrainians pushed to flee Russian aggression have no other choice than turning to neighbouring EU countries (and Moldova)., Interestingly, the Temporary Protection Directive also includes a solidarity clause, which equally found little support from Member States in the past. Under this clause, EU countries should notify the Council and the Commission of their reception capacities and relocate people from countries where capacities are exceeded. This time, however, those countries that opposed relocation most strongly in the past (like Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia) are the main destination countries at the moment – not only due to their geographic location but also their sizable Ukrainian diasporas. Still, it can be expected that relocation will be a topic of discussion even with the current broad support for people fleeing Ukraine – not least because it will concern a significant number of people and, according to the Directive, relocation will also require the consent of persons concerned., But there is more to clarify than just relocation. Under which circumstances can people under temporary protection access regular asylum procedures (which the Directive suggests remain open)? How will reception support be organised if the Reception Conditions Directive does not apply under temporary protection? What concrete next steps will Member States need to take following the activation of the Temporary Protection Directive? These are just a few of the questions that need answers and guidance once (if) the Directive is triggered., The Temporary Protection Directive, above all, avoids lengthy procedures for determining whether someone is individually persecuted or faces indiscriminate violence. All those who arrive in large numbers (a “mass influx”) from a specific country or geographic region described by the Commission and adopted by the Council immediately enjoy temporary protection for at least one year. Temporary protection allows for access to employment and self-employment activities, education, housing, health care, and family unity. It basically contains most of the rights that come with refugee or subsidiary protection status – without the bureaucratic headache., Finally, while the title of the protection status suggests temporality, it can in fact last for a long time. Turkey, for example, introduced temporary protection for Syrians in 2014, and 8 years later, this status is still valid. All depends on the developments in Ukraine, particularly when the war is over and the situation allows people to return. Before then, temporary status will not be lifted. In the former Yugoslavian context, after temporary protection was lifted, many returned or had to return but a significant number of Bosnians remained in Austria and Germany, transitioning to a regular residence permit and eventually naturalising., What next?, What is currently most important is to swiftly grant access to health care, housing, and other basic needs for a large number of people, who right now are largely women, children, and elderly men. This is what temporary protection can offer better than the conventional statuses. And in fact countries like Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland have already adopted or plan to adopt national emergency regulations that in essence provide temporary protection. But national approaches could lead to unwanted differences in protection across the EU., But first, the ball is in the Commission’s court. During the Extraordinary Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council on 27 February 2022, the Commission proposed the activation of the Directive, and ministers appeared to broadly support it. With a qualified majority vote, a Council Decision could introduce temporary protection within the EU as soon as tomorrow’s Council meeting (3 March)., Ahead of this Council meeting, the Commission today released its proposal to the Council. The Commission proposes to apply temporary protection to Ukrainian nationals as well as third country nationals and stateless persons residing legally in Ukraine (given that they are unable to return to their country or region of origin or they resided long-term in Ukraine) and their family members. It will take immediate effect with the publication of the Council Decision and will last initially for one year (which can be prolonged). Member States shall exchange information on its implementation via the Migration Preparedness and Crisis Management Network, coordinated by the Commission. Solidarity or relocation are not described in more detail. In addition, the proposal comes with a Communication providing operational guidelines for external border management to facilitate border crossings at the EU-Ukraine borders. Overall, the Commission estimates the expected displacement between 2.5 and 6.5 million people. Around half of these people are expected to find support from the large Ukrainian diaspora in the EU, while the other half might seek international protection in the coming years., Temporary protection, which has already been declared dead many times, could therefore see a historic revival as soon as tomorrow – probably not because it is the best instrument, but because it is the only one available right now. Still, it could become a key symbol of the much-needed unbureaucratic and unified EU response for Ukrainians suffering the darkest hour in our recent history., Suggested further reading:, Authors, Martin Wagner, 14 Publications - See all Publications, Downloads, The war in Ukraine and the renaissance of temporary protection - why this might be the only way to go, 02 March 2022, (EN) DOWNLOAD",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/war-ukraine-and-renaissance-temporary-protection-why-might-be-only-way-go
La réaction officielle et médiatique européenne face à la crise ukrainienne révèle une politique raciste profondément enracinée contre les non-Européens,News and Press Release,Euro-Med Monitor,Protection and Human Rights,2 Mar 2022,"Genève - Les positions officielles et médiatiques de l'Europe face à la crise ukrainienne, qui a débouché sur une crise des réfugiés, ont révélé une politique européenne raciste profondément enracinée qui exclut et discrimine les ethnies non-européennes, a déclaré mercredi l'Observatoire Euro-Méditerranéen des Droits de l'Homme dans un communiqué., Les autorités de sécurité en Ukraine et en Pologne, ainsi que d'autres politiciens et journalistes européens, ont montré ces derniers jours plusieurs formes de racisme et de discrimination basées sur la race, la couleur et la religion, à l'encontre des réfugiés fuyant la guerre que la Russie a lancée sur l'Ukraine le 24 février., L'équipe d'Euro-Med Monitor a suivi des témoignages et des vidéos montrant que les gardes-frontières polonais suivent une politique discriminatoire envers les non-Européens, en empêchant le passage des Africains tout en permettant aux Ukrainiens de traverser et en leur fournissant de la nourriture et des premiers soins., Michela Pugliese, chercheuse en migration et asile à Euro-Med Monitor, a déclaré : ""Alors que les pays européens accueillent les réfugiés ukrainiens et leur fournissent des itinéraires de transit officiels et sûrs, sept demandeurs d'asile d'ethnie non européenne sont morts hier, après le naufrage de leur bateau en Méditerranée, au large des côtes grecques."", ""Des itinéraires sûrs devraient être fournis à tous les migrants et demandeurs d'asile, quelle que soit leur race, leur religion ou leur nationalité"", a-t-elle ajouté., Des étudiants et des résidents de nationalités arabe et africaine en Ukraine ont déclaré à Euro-Med Monitor qu'ils ont été contraints de rester assis pendant de longues heures à la frontière polonaise sans aucune aide, et certains d'entre eux - en particulier ceux à la peau noire - ont été empêchés de traverser sans raison et sont restés bloqués aux frontières. Dans le même temps, de grandes facilités étaient accordées aux Ukrainiens blancs, qui étaient autorisés à traverser sans visa et à voyager en train sans billet., Les Indiens résidant en Ukraine ont également déclaré avoir été confrontés à de grandes difficultés lorsqu'ils ont fui le pays, car ils n'ont pas été autorisés à monter dans les trains et leur traversée a été retardée, alors que les Ukrainiens ont été autorisés à traverser en premier., La discrimination s'est également étendue aux niveaux politiques officiels, comme l'a déclaré le Premier ministre bulgare Kiril Petkov : ""Ces gens sont intelligents, ce sont des gens éduqués..... Ce n'est pas la vague de réfugiés à laquelle nous étions habitués, des gens dont nous n'étions pas sûrs de l'identité, des gens au passé peu clair, qui auraient même pu être des terroristes."", Les principaux pays européens ont fait preuve de souplesse, ont accueilli les réfugiés ukrainiens et ont pris des décisions pour faciliter leur accueil et leur séjour, ce qui contraste fortement avec la politique d'expulsion et de refoulement qu'ils ont suivie lorsqu'ils ont eu affaire à des demandeurs d'asile du Moyen-Orient et d'Afrique du Nord, qui connaissent également de violents conflits - parfois plus graves que le conflit russo-ukrainien., Les journalistes et médias européens ont utilisé un discours raciste, mettant l'accent sur le fait que les réfugiés ukrainiens sont civilisés, contrairement aux réfugiés du Moyen-Orient et d'Afrique du Nord qui ont été stigmatisés comme terroristes et non civilisés., Par exemple, Charlie D'Agata, le correspondant étranger de CBS, a déclaré à la télévision : ""Ce n'est pas un endroit, avec tout mon respect, comme l'Irak ou l'Afghanistan, où le conflit fait rage depuis des décennies... C'est une ville relativement civilisée, relativement européenne - je dois aussi choisir ces mots avec soin - où l'on ne s'attend pas à cela ou à espérer que cela se produise."", Bien que, le correspondant se soit excusé après une vague de critiques généralisées sur les plateformes de médias sociaux, ses déclarations reflètent les opinions et les impressions d'une grande partie des journalistes qui ont parlé de la crise avec des expressions similaires., De même, Peter Dobbie, un présentateur d'Al Jazeera English, a fait une comparaison apparemment discriminatoire entre les réfugiés ukrainiens et les réfugiés du Moyen-Orient et d'Afrique du Nord, en disant : ""Ce qui est convaincant, c'est que juste en les regardant, la façon dont ils sont habillés. Ce sont des gens prospères, de la classe moyenne, ce ne sont pas manifestement des réfugiés qui essaient de fuir des régions du Moyen-Orient qui sont toujours en guerre. Ce ne sont pas des gens qui essaient de fuir des régions d'Afrique du Nord. Ils ressemblent à n'importe quelle famille européenne dont vous seriez le voisin."", Le journaliste Philip Korb sur BFM, l'une des chaînes les plus regardées de France, a déclaré à l'antenne : ""On ne parle pas ici de Syriens qui fuient les bombardements du régime syrien soutenu par Poutine, on parle d'Européens qui partent dans des voitures qui ressemblent aux nôtres pour sauver leur vie."", Parallèlement, sur la chaîne britannique ITV, un correspondant en Pologne a déclaré : ""Ce n'est pas une nation du tiers monde en développement. C'est l'Europe."", Les déclarations racistes sont également venues de personnes autres que des journalistes. La BBC a reçu l'ancien procureur adjoint ukrainien, David Sakvarelidze, qui a déclaré : ""C'est très émouvant pour moi parce que je vois des Européens aux yeux bleus et aux cheveux blonds se faire tuer, des enfants se faire tuer chaque jour par les missiles, les hélicoptères et les roquettes du président russe Poutine."", Alors qu'Euro-Med Monitor exprime sa pleine solidarité avec les victimes civiles de la guerre en Ukraine, en particulier avec les réfugiés qui tentent de fuir, l'odieuse duplicité dans la gestion sécuritaire, politique et médiatique européenne des crises humanitaires résultant de cette guerre est répréhensible., Toutes ces pratiques sont des formes de discrimination raciale selon l'article 1 de la Convention internationale sur l'élimination de toutes les formes de discrimination raciale qui la définit comme ""toute distinction, exclusion, restriction ou préférence fondée sur la race, la couleur, l'ascendance ou l'origine nationale ou ethnique, qui a pour but ou pour effet de détruire ou de compromettre la reconnaissance, la jouissance ou l'exercice, dans des conditions d'égalité, des droits de l'homme et des libertés fondamentales dans les domaines politique, économique, social et culturel ou dans tout autre domaine de la vie publique""., Le traitement humain des réfugiés par l'Union européenne et les pays européens devrait inclure les réfugiés de différentes races, religions et nationalités, loin des doubles standards dans le traitement des questions humanitaires qui indiquent une profonde régression des valeurs, une pensée discriminatoire dangereuse et une ignorance des principes fondamentaux des droits de l'homme., Le Rapporteur spécial sur les formes contemporaines de racisme et de discrimination raciale devrait enquêter sur les rapports et les témoignages concernant les pratiques de discrimination raciale dans le traitement des personnes fuyant la guerre en Ukraine., Toutes les parties en conflit devraient respecter les règles du droit humanitaire international et les Conventions de Genève pendant la guerre, afin d'éviter de mettre en danger les civils et de les éloigner de toutes les hostilités.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/la-r-action-officielle-et-m-diatique-europ-enne-face-la-crise-ukrainienne-r-v-le-une
Nuclear power plant vulnerability during military conflict – Ukraine technical briefing,Analysis,Greenpeace,Climate Change and Environment,2 Mar 2022,"New analysis on severe nuclear hazards at Zaporizhzhia plant in Ukraine – only solution is immediate end to war, Amsterdam – Vladimir Putin’s military invasion of Ukraine poses an unprecedented nuclear threat, with the country’s 15 commercial nuclear reactors, including the largest nuclear plant in Europe, at risk of potentially catastrophic damage that could render vast areas of the European continent, including Russia, uninhabitable for decades, new analysis shows.[1], At the Zaporizhzhia plant, which produced 19% of Ukraine’s electricity in 2020 and where Russian troops and military hardware are within kilometres,[2] there are six large reactors and six cooling pools with hundreds of tons of highly radioactive nuclear fuel. Three reactors are currently operating and three have been shut down since the start of the war., The assembled research by specialists for Greenpeace International concludes that the safety of Zaporizhzhia is severely compromised by the war. In a worst-case scenario, where explosions destroy the reactor containment and cooling systems, the potential release of radioactivity from both the reactor core and the spent fuel pool into the atmosphere could create a disaster far worse even than the Fukushima Daiichi catastrophe of 2011, with areas of land hundreds of kilometres from the reactor site potentially becoming inhospitable for decades. Even without direct damage to the plant, the reactor’s rely heavily on the electric grid for operating cooling systems, on the availability of nuclear technicians and personnel and access to heavy equipment and logistics., Jan Vande Putte, co-author of the risk analysis,[3] said:, “To add to the horrific events of the last week there is a unique nuclear threat. For the first time in history a major war is being waged in a country with multiple nuclear reactors and thousands of tons of highly radioactive spent fuel. The war in southern Ukraine around Zaporizhzhia puts them all at heightened risk of a severe accident. So long as this war continues the military threat to Ukraines nuclear plants will remain. This is one further reason, amongst so many, why Putin needs to immediately cease his war on Ukraine.”, Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Greenpeace International has been closely monitoring the implications for the nuclear installations throughout the country. Today, Greenpeace International has published a technical analysis on some of the major risks at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine., In the case of an accidental bombing and certainly in case of a deliberate attack, the consequences could be catastrophic, well beyond the impact of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. Because of the vulnerability of the nuclear power plants, its dependency on a complex set of support systems, and the long period of time it takes to bring the power plant into a more passive safety level, the only way to substantially reduce the risks is to halt the war., Greenpeace wishes to express its deep respect and appreciation to all the workers at the nuclear power plant sites in the Ukraine, including Chornobyl, who are working under extreme conditions to maintain the stability of nuclear power plants.[4] They are not only protecting the safety of their own country but also of a large part of Europe., The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors held an emergency session Wednesday 2 March to discuss the Ukraine nuclear crisis.[5], END, Notes:, [1]. “The vulnerability of nuclear plants during military conflict Lessons from Fukushima Daiichi Focus on Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine”, Jan Vande Putte (radiation protection advisor & nuclear campaigner, Greenpeace East Asia & Greenpeace Belgium) and Shaun Burnie (senior nuclear specialist, Greenpeace East Asia) https://www.greenpeace.org/international/nuclear-power-plant-vulnerability-during-military-conflict-ukraine-technical-briefing/ – key findings listed below., [2] Local reports on 2 March suggested that thousands of civilians in Enerhodar, the host town of the Zaporizhzhia reactors, were attempting to block the advance of Russian troops to the nuclear plant.

Follow @greenpeacepress on Twitter for our latest international press releases, Key findings of the Greenpeace analysis are:, The Zaporizhzhia plant, like all reactors, with hot highly radioactive fuel, requires constant electrical power for cooling even when shut down. When the electricity grid fails and the reactor is in a station black out, there are backup diesel generators and batteries, but their reliability over a longer period of time cannot be guaranteed. There are unresolved on-going issues with the Zaporizhzhia emergency diesel generators, which have an estimated fuel stock on site for only seven days., Official data from 2017 reported that at Zaporizhzhia there were 2,204 tons of high level spent fuel – 855 tons of which were in highly vulnerable spent fuel pools. Without active cooling, they risk overheating and evaporating to a point where the fuel metal cladding could ignite and release most of the radioactive inventory.
Zaporizhzhia, like all operating nuclear power plants, requires a complex support system, including the permanent presence of qualified personnel, power, access to cooling water, spare parts and equipment. Such support systems are severely compromised during a war., The nuclear reactor buildings of Zaporizhzhia have a concrete containment protecting both the reactor core, its cooling system and the spent fuel pool. However, such containment cannot withstand the impact of heavy munitions. The plant could be hit accidently. It seems unlikely that the plant would be targeted deliberately, given that the nuclear release could severely contaminate neighbouring countries including Russia. Still, this cannot be entirely ruled out.
In the worst-case scenario, the reactor containment would be destroyed by explosions and the cooling system would fail, the radioactivity of both the reactor and the fuel pool could then freely escape into the atmosphere. This risks making the entire plant inaccessible because of the high radiation levels, which could then lead to a further cascade of the other reactors and fuel pools, each spreading large quantities of radioactivity into different wind directions over several weeks. It could make a large part of Europe, including Russia, uninhabitable for at least many decades and over a distance of hundreds of kilometres, a nightmare scenario and potentially far worse than the Fukushima Daiichi disaster in 2011., It takes a long time to bring a power plant in operation into a stage of passive safety which does not require further human intervention. When a reactor is shut down, the residual heat from the radioactivity decreases exponentially, still it remains very hot and requires cooling over a period of 5 years before it can be loaded into concrete dry storage containers which remove their heat through natural circulation of the air outside the container. Shutting down a reactor might progressively decrease the risks over time, but it does not solve the problem.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/nuclear-power-plant-vulnerability-during-military-conflict-ukraine-technical-briefing

The next report will be produced on 2 March., HIGHLIGHTS, • The Secretary-General today launched two plans to help people across Ukraine and beyond. Within Ukraine, the humanitarian plan requires $1.1 billion to meet the escalating humanitarian needs of more than 6 million people affected and displaced by military operations over the next three months. Outside the country, the UN and partners are requesting $551 million to help Ukrainians who have fled across borders, principally to Poland, Hungary, Romania and the Republic of Moldova., • Heavy fighting and shelling continue across several towns and cities in Ukraine, with increasing human cost and humanitarian consequence. At least 550 civilian casualties, including 142 deaths, have been recorded by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) between 24 to 28 February. Most of these casualties were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and Multiple Launch Rocket Systems as well as air strikes, according to the same source., • Reports of civilians trapped in towns and cities under shelling continue, including in Volnovakha and Mariupol in Donetska oblast as well as in other locations within and beyond eastern Ukraine. Hostilities or shelling have also continued in and around major cities, such as Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Kyiv. Clashes have also been reported near the “contact line” in eastern Ukraine, with communities on both sides severely impacted., • Damage and destruction to water, electricity and sanitation facilities, as well as road and residential infrastructure continue to be reported across several areas, shattering people’s lives and disrupting access to these vital services for hundreds of thousands., • Population movement remains fluid and according to latest figures by UNHCR, at least 677,000 people have now fled Ukraine to neighboring countries, while over 100,000 have so far been internally displaced. Real figures are considerably higher as corroboration is ongoing, albeit with delays and security challenges., • Despite challenges and the volatile situation, humanitarian partners, especially local and civil society organizations on the ground, continue to respond to people’s needs, facilitate evacuation and provide shelter. UN and international organizations are also making efforts to complement local response wherever they can., SITUATION OVERVIEW, The United Nations and humanitarian partners launched today coordinated emergency appeals to urgently deliver humanitarian assistance and protection services to people in Ukraine and refugees in neighbouring countries. During the launch event, the UN Secretary-General appealed to the donors and member states to continue and scale-up their funding contributions to both appeals, which seek a combined US$1.7 billion in funding. Around $1.1 billion of this is part of the Flash Appeal, which aims to assist 6 million people, including 2.1 million internally displaced people in Ukraine for an initial three months. An inter-agency Regional Refugee Response Plan for the Ukraine situation asks for a preliminary $550.6 million to help refugees in the region. The Secretary-General also pleaded for respect for international humanitarian law and protection of civilians, stressing that the safety and freedom of movement of aid workers must also be guaranteed., Meanwhile, the human cost of the ongoing violence in country is alarming. As shelling, attacks and clashes continue across towns and cities, men, children and women are caught in crossfire. Between 24 and 28 February, airstrikes, shelling, shooting and overall violence have already killed 142 civilians, including 13 boys and girls. Another 408 civilians have been injured, including 26 children, across the country. With 256 civilians killed or injured, both sides of the “contact line” in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts in eastern Ukraine account for the highest number of casualties in terms of geography. The remaining casualties have been recorded across other parts of the country, including in Cherkasy, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Sumy and Zaporizhzhia, according to the same source. These figures, however, may be an underestimate, given the existing challenges with corroborating data due to security situation., Hostilities have continued in and around towns and cities across southern, northern and eastern parts of the country. Densely populated areas, including in Chernihiv, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kherson and Sumy are continuously under fire, with periodic clashes, explosions as well as aerial strikes and the use of Multiple Launch Rocket Systems reported between this and previous reporting period. In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, which were already affected by an eight-year-old conflict, active fighting is reportedly ongoing on both sides of the contact line, including in Donetsk, Horlivka, Mariupol, Volnovakha, Sievierodonetsk and other towns and settlements. In certain areas, including in Kharkiv and Mariupol, the population reportedly cannot leave the areas of active fighting, encircled by armed forces as well as due to contamination of roads by unexploded ordnance and damage or destruction., The impact of these hostilities on civilian infrastructure is worsening people’s already fragile situation. For example, damage to infrastructure has reportedly left 400,000 people without electricity in Donetsk and Horlivka on both sides of the “contact line”. In another instance, more than 40,000 people around Horlivka remain without access to water. A school in Donetsk and a children’s centre in Sievierodonetsk also reportedly came under fire. Access to shops, markets, healthcare and basic facilities in areas of active fighting also remains severely curtailed., The number of people fleeing from their homes continues to grow by the hour. An average of 100,000 people per day have crossed international borders since 24 February, and as of 1 March, a total of 677,000 people have crossed towards Poland, Hungary, Romania, Moldova, Slovakia and others countries, according to UNHCR. In country, more than 100,000 people have been internally displaced so far, according to the same source. However, the actual numbers are higher, as reports continue of people moving out of the major cities, including in thousands, for the sixth consecutive day., Preliminary data collected through the Protection Monitoring Tool for Emergencies led by the Protection Cluster indicates the majority of internally displaced people (IDPs) come originally from eastern, northern and southern oblasts. At least 30 per cent of the new IDP arrivals indicated the intention to continue moving further on to other locations. The monitoring shows that children, women and girls, persons with disabilities and elderly are the most vulnerable. Access to social and administrative services were largely available in their host locations and IDPs were primarily sheltering in private accommodations and/or with families. The IDPs expressed they urgently need transportation, medicine and emergency healthcare., HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE, Despite response challenges, UN agencies and humanitarian partners, especially local non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations, continue to deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance, including in hard-to-reach areas., • In border areas in the west, the Government and humanitarian partners are quickly scaling up their activities to address people’s immediate needs, including through provision of food and non-food items (NFIs). More than 25 centres have been set up by local organizations and volunteers to provide food, clothing and shelter to people fleeing., • UNICEF are also supporting mobile teams on the ground to reach out to children evacuated, those in shelters and families on the move to offer psychological support and other child protection services. A truck of NFIs by UNHCR arrived from Kyiv to Krivy Rih in central Ukraine; IOM has also set up a hotline number to provide people with up-to-date information on locations and services available as they move., • The Red Cross and its volunteers are supporting with treating wounded and with evacuations. The Red Cross also reached around 8,000 people in shelters in subway stations with food and NFIs. ICRC is also providing support, including through delivery of water to affected settlements, NFIs and the provision of first aid care. ICRC and IFRC have together launched today an appeal for US$272 million to scale-up response to the crisis in Ukraine., • Efforts to strengthen GBV and SRH sub-sector coordination at national and sub-national levels are also ongoing with the respective authorities and UN agencies., • UNDP is providing medical products to test and deliver donated blood. The agency also provided expertise to expand the functionality of the state e-service Diia mobile application and the e-Pidtrymka (e- Support) national programme to collect citizens’ donations for the crisis response in coordination.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-impact-situation-report-500-pm-eet-1-march-2022

In Kharkiv, where several attacks from MLRS hit residential areas, at least 46 civilian casualties, 9 killed (6 adults and 3 children), and 37 injured (34 adults and 3 children), were recorded., In total, from 4am on 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s military action against Ukraine started, until 12 midnight on 28 February 2022, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 550 civilian casualties in Ukraine: 142 killed (22 men, 19 women, 4 boys, 3 girls, as well as 6 children and 88 adults whose sex is yet unknown) and 408 injured (36 men, 25 women, 6 girls, 2 boys, as well as 18 children and 321 adults whose sex is yet unknown). 256 casualties (58 killed and 198 injured) were recorded in Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 190 (40 killed and 150 injured) in Government-controlled territory, and 66 (18 killed and 48 injured) in territory controlled by the self-proclaimed ‘republics’. 294 casualties (84 killed and 210 injured) were recorded in other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Sumy and Zaporizhzhia regions) in places, which were under Government control when casualties occurred., Most of these casualties were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area2, including shelling from heavy artillery and MLRS, and air strikes., OHCHR believes that real figures are considerably higher, especially in Government-controlled territory and especially in recent days, as the receipt of information from some locations where intensive hostilities have been going on was delayed and many reports were still pending corroboration., In this context, OHCHR notes that the Ministry of Health of Ukraine reported 352 persons (338 adults and 14 children) killed, and 1,684 persons (1,568 adults and 116 children) injured as of 27 February.

What the UN General Assembly can do for Ukraine,Analysis,ICG,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",28 Feb 2022,"The UN General Assembly begins an Emergency Special Session on the war in Ukraine. UN members, and especially those from Africa, Asia and Latin America, should use this opportunity to condemn Russia's aggression and take steps to contain and de-escalate the conflict., The United Nations General Assembly will hold an Emergency Special Session on the war in Ukraine this week, beginning today. This is potentially a key moment for all members of the UN to condemn Russia’s aggression, call for an immediate cessation of hostilities and reaffirm Ukraine’s territorial integrity. The General Assembly must send a clear message in support of Ukraine, and African, Asian and Latin American members in particular should make their voices heard., This week’s General Assembly session follows Russia’s predictable decision to block a Security Council resolution deploring its actions last Friday. On Sunday 27 February, the Council passed a procedural resolution – with eleven votes in favour, three abstentions and Russia’s no-vote (Russia could not veto the text under UN rules) – requesting the General Assembly to meet in line with the long-established but rarely used “Uniting for Peace” formula. Created in 1950 during the Korean War, this allows the Assembly to make “appropriate recommendations” on collective responses to security crises in cases where the Security Council cannot act “because of a lack of unanimity of the permanent members”. Though still not legally binding, these recommendations carry more symbolic weight than normal General Assembly resolutions., The U.S. and its European allies have been prominent in calling for a General Assembly meeting. Yet non-Western countries predominate in the Assembly, and it is their votes that will spell the difference between diplomatic success and failure. There is some reason for hope. During last week’s Security Council debates, it was representatives from the Global South who offered the most compelling interventions. Non-Western states would do well to refer to the permanent representative of Kenya’s statement to the Security Council on Monday 21 February, which drew parallels between Ukraine’s plight and the “domination and oppression” faced by African states from colonial powers. The permanent representative of Mexico, another elected Council member, also compared the situation to its own history of invasions by foreign powers., As Kenya and Mexico made clear – and the other Council members, including Gabon, Ghana and Brazil, have affirmed in speeches over the last week – the war in Ukraine is not solely a European security affair. Russia’s actions ride roughshod over two principles at the core of the UN Charter: the sovereign equality of its member states and the prohibition on the threat or use of force in international relations. As they have done elsewhere, Russian military operations also appear to have transgressed international humanitarian law, including its requirements for the protection of civilians, and the U.S. has sent the Human Rights Council what Washington says is evidence of Russian plans to imprison or kill Ukrainian leaders., In a number of crises, many of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) at the UN, which comprises some 120 non-Western states, have accused the United States and its allies of using international humanitarian and human rights law to trump the basic norms of sovereignty and non-use of force. In this case, there is no such dichotomy. Russia is in clear breach of its obligations in all these areas, in addition to recklessly raising the spectre of nuclear weapons use in its rhetoric. Members of the NAM, and all members of the UN, should condemn Moscow’s actions against the rules and principles that underpin the organisation. The failure to do so can only weaken those rules and principles, embolden others who might follow in Russia’s footsteps elsewhere, and make the UN’s efforts to contain such behaviour that much more difficult., Although the General Assembly lacks the Security Council’s power to impose binding sanctions or other coercive measures under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, it nevertheless can and should help to galvanise global pressure to reverse Russian aggression and aid its victims by:, Encouraging UN Secretary-General António Guterres to offer any forms of diplomatic or technical expertise (potentially including the appointment of a special representative) necessary to advance ceasefire talks and humanitarian access to conflict-affected areas., Recommending that UN member states apply temporary and exceptional sanctions against Russia. Many members of the NAM are wary of sanctions, but the Assembly can mitigate some of these concerns if the resolution also: (i) proposes the creation of a register for states to record their sanctions against Russia, to boost transparency; and (ii) urges states to commit to ending such sanctions promptly if Russia ceases hostilities and verifiably withdraws its forces from Ukraine., Mandating a Commission of Inquiry to collate evidence of war crimes and other atrocities during the fighting, as a deterrent against battlefield atrocities and to counter misinformation and disinformation about the war. The Assembly would be wise, however, to steer clear of any reference to international criminal proceedings against Russian military or civilian leaders, an idea that could lead them to believe their personal stake in the conflict is existential, and make de-escalation more challenging., Requesting the president of the General Assembly to appoint a senior envoy – such as a former head of state – to act as the body’s representative on humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees, in support of the work UN agencies are already undertaking., Calling for the safe, secure and orderly evacuation from Ukraine of foreign nationals, including African and Asian workers and students, seeking to leave. There have been reports of Ukrainian officials discriminating against African residents trying to get on buses and trains to flee., Calling on Russia to lower its nuclear alert level, and reminding all the P5 members of their January 2022 declaration to the UN that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought”., Reaffirming the basic principles of sovereignty and non-use of force in the UN Charter., None of these actions will end the war in its own right. Neither the General Assembly nor the UN system as a whole has the leverage to impose peace on Russia. But the Assembly can, through both its words and resolutions, make it clear that the majority of UN members reject what Moscow has done, will support peacemaking efforts and stand ready to help the victims of this tragic, needless and perilous war.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/what-un-general-assembly-can-do-ukraine
Update 5 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (1 March 2022) [EN/RU],News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,1 Mar 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) today that all of the country’s nuclear power plants remained under the control of the national operator and there were no new reports of potential threats to the sites, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said, reiterating his continued grave concern about the conflict and its potential consequences., In its latest regular update to the IAEA, the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine (SNRIU) said it was communicating regularly with the plants and they were continuing to operate safely and securely. Their physical protection systems were in regular mode and the radiation levels at the sites were also normal, it added., Earlier this week, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry informed the IAEA that Russian military forces were advancing close to the largest of the sites – the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in eastern Ukraine. As the Agency reported on 28 February, additional information received on that day from the operator confirmed that the Russian forces were near the site but had not entered it., Director General Grossi has repeatedly stressed that any military or other action that could threaten the safety or security of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants – 15 reactors at four sites – must be avoided., “I remain gravely concerned about the situation in Ukraine, especially regarding the safety and security of its nuclear power plants,” he said. “I renew my strong appeal to avoid any potential danger or threat to these facilities as any accident could have very severe consequences.”, “I also want to express my deep admiration and sincere gratitude for the tireless work, vigilance and bravery of the personnel operating the nuclear power plants, other nuclear facilities, and the staff of the regulator. We can all be very thankful for their determined and courageous efforts to ensure continued nuclear safety and security,” he added., SNRIU said that all radioactive waste disposal facilities of the State Specialized Enterprise Radon were operating as usual, and the radiation monitoring systems did not indicate any deviations from normal values. On 27 February, the SNRIU informed the IAEA that missiles had hit the site of such a facility in the capital Kyiv, but there was no damage to the building and no reports of a radioactive release., Ukraine last week informed the IAEA that Russian forces had taken control of the facilities of the State Specialized Enterprise Chornobyl NPP, located within the Exclusion Zone set up after the 1986 accident. The regulator said today that radiation levels around the facility were being monitored and did not exceed usual levels. Available plant personnel have not changed since last week and they are operating in shifts, it added., The IAEA continues to closely monitor developments in Ukraine, with a special focus on the safety and security of its nuclear power reactors. The IAEA remains in constant contact with its counterpart and will continue to provide regular updates on the situation in Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-5-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-1-march-2022-enru

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Mar 2022,"Kyiv 1 March, 2022 - Children injured in conflict zones are at even greater risk than adults due to their specific vulnerabilities and treatment needs for blast wounds, said Save the Children calling for an immediate end to violence in Ukraine as Russia’s military operation intensifies in major cities., At least 14 children have already been killed, according to the UN, with fears that many more lives are at risk as a satellite picture reveals a Russian military convoy about 40 miles long is closing in on Kyiv., Children are in grave danger, especially from the threat of explosive weapons. Younger children injured in blasts are particularly at risk of death compared to adults and need to be treated differently. Children have weaker necks and torsos than adults, so less force is needed to cause a brain injury. In warzones, head injuries are common in young children, with patients under seven years old twice as likely to present a head injury than those over seven years., Across Kyiv, the city’s three million residents are taking refuge in basements, metro stations and bomb shelters, unable to leave their homes due to the active fighting in the capital. Patients in maternity wards and children’s hospitals are also hiding for their lives underground with little light and limited access to medicine, clean water and food., On Monday, heavy shelling in Kharkiv killed three children according to the city’s mayor, and a six-year-old girl died in an attack at the port of Mariupol on Sunday, who medics could not save., In conflict zones, even trained medical staff such as surgeons, nurses and therapists can lack the emergency medical training and expertise they need to treat children. Health facilities and medical teams operating in conflict zones are often overwhelmed and under-resourced., Save the Children, in partnership with Imperial College London and medical experts, developed a comprehensive manual - the first of its kind - to support children injured in conflict. The manual helps medical teams in conflict zones, who are often forced to operate on and treat children in difficult circumstances with limited specialist training and resources in how to do so., James Denselow, Head of Conflict and Humanitarian at Save the Children UK, said:, *“Over the past six days, **children in *Ukraine have watched their homes and schools be destroyed, been forced to flee or hide in basements and bomb shelters, and have been torn apart from their families and friends., *“We are seeing videos of children singing from shelters to keep their spirits up. No child should ever be put in this situation. These children should be in school or playing outside, but instead, they are fearing for their lives. These children need urgent protection and for the Russian military operation to stop immediately. *, “The situation is spiraling out of control. If the conflict escalates further, we fear the death toll for children will continue to rise substantially in the coming days and even hours.”, Save the Children has been operating in Ukraine since 2014, delivering essential humanitarian aid to children and their families. This includes supporting their access to education, providing psychosocial support, distributing winter kits and hygiene kits, and providing cash grants to families so they can meet basic needs such as food, rent and medicines, or so they can invest in new businesses., The Children Emergency Fund allows Save the Children to respond wherever the need is greatest to reach children quickly with the essentials they need to survive., For further enquiries please contact:, Samantha Halyk Samantha.halyk@savethechildren.org /+44(0) 74235 19077, Our media out of hours (BST) contact is media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-children-grave-danger-blast-injuries-russian-convoy-closes
EU: Keep Borders Open for People Fleeing Ukraine [EN/PT],News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,1 Mar 2022,"Ensure Safety, Protection for Ukrainians and Others, (Brussels) – The European Union and its member states should do everything they can to ensure safe passage and fair treatment for all civilians fleeing Ukraine, Human Rights Watch said today. Justice and home affairs ministers meeting on March 3-4, 2022, should endorse a holistic plan of action that includes measures to ensure access to territory, protection, and support for everyone escaping the war., “We’ve seen a swift and encouraging show of solidarity with Ukrainians, and we applaud the EU’s readiness to streamline access to sanctuary through the EU’s Temporary Protection Directive,” said Judith Sunderland, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “It’s vitally important for all EU states and institutions to work to help everyone, including non-Ukrainians, reach safety, and get the care, protection, and assistance they need.”, Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes in Ukraine since the full-scale Russian invasion began on February 24. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as of February 28, over 500,000 people had fled to neighboring countries and 100,000 had been displaced within Ukraine. UNHCR has called on all receiving countries to welcome everyone fleeing conflict and insecurity in Ukraine “irrespective of nationality and race.”, Human Rights Watch and others have documented serious violations of the laws of war by Russian forces, including the use of cluster munitions that hit a hospital and a preschool. According to the United Nations, civilian casualties from the first four days of the conflict are at 406, including 102 deaths., EU countries neighboring Ukraine – Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania – should not be expected to assume all responsibility for refugees from Ukraine. Arrangements should be made to ensure an equitable sharing of responsibility by all member states, including via an efficient and fair relocation plan that takes into account family ties and, insofar as possible, individual preferences., It is vitally important for all countries neighboring Ukraine to allow everyone to enter with a minimum of bureaucratic procedures. Those with friends or family with whom they can stay should be allowed to proceed to those destinations, and individuals and families in need of accommodation should have access to dignified and adequate housing. Crucial services such as health care, including mental health care, and support services for children should be made available, and they should be able to resume their education as soon as possible.
These conditions should apply equally to Ukrainians and non-Ukrainians fleeing the conflict, Human Rights Watch said. EU member states and institutions should clarify to Ukrainian authorities that they will accept all civilians leaving Ukraine, without distinction, and actively work with Ukrainian authorities to ensure that people can exercise their right to leave without unnecessary delay and to facilitate transit and access to EU territory., Human Rights Watch has spoken with foreign nationals who said Ukrainian authorities prevented them from boarding evacuation trains or stopped them from reaching the border to make way for Ukrainian women and children. The African Union issued a statement on February 28 urging “all countries to respect international law and show the same empathy and support to all people fleeing war notwithstanding their racial identity.” There are reports also of some foreign nationals facing problems at EU borders. On March 1, while commending neighboring countries for keeping their borders open, UNHCR said it was “aware of challenges faced by some third country nationals seeking to enter Poland.”, The likely move to invoke the Temporary Protection Directive is positive, Human Rights Watch said. This would be the first time the EU has triggered the directive, adopted in 2001 in the aftermath of the refugee movements caused by the war in the former Yugoslavia. The directive would allow for streamlined, blanket protection for up to three years to people displaced by the war in Ukraine and unable to return to their country of origin. EU member states and institutions should ensure that non-Ukrainians in a similar situation are afforded the same protection and rights, and that all non-Ukrainians leaving Ukraine are given access to EU territory and that their rights and dignity are respected. Nationals of other countries fleeing Ukraine who wish to return to their countries of origin should receive appropriate assistance to do so., EU countries should also secure the status of Ukrainians already on their territory. This includes migrant workers on temporary work visas as well as Ukrainians slated for return to Ukraine. Any Ukrainian national in detention pending deportation should be released. All EU member states that have designated Ukraine a “safe country” on a list of safe countries for the purpose of returns should amend the list to reflect the dramatic change in circumstance., “This is a landmark moment for Europe, and an opportunity for the European Union to remedy the wrongs of the past and rise to the occasion with genuine compassion and solidarity,” Sunderland said. “That requires a truly collective commitment to keeping the door and our hearts open to everyone fleeing Ukraine.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/eu-keep-borders-open-people-fleeing-ukraine-enpt
"Statement of ICC Prosecutor, Karim A.A. Khan QC, on the Situation in Ukraine: “I have decided to proceed with opening an investigation.” [EN/RU/UK]",News and Press Release,ICC,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,28 Feb 2022,"Last Friday, I expressed my increasing concern, echoing those of world leaders and citizens of the world alike, over the events unfolding in Ukraine., Today, I wish to announce that I have decided to proceed with opening an investigation into the Situation in Ukraine, as rapidly as possible., Ukraine is not a State Party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (""ICC"" or the ""Court""), so cannot itself refer the situation to my Office. But it has twice exercised its prerogatives to legally accept the Court's jurisdiction over alleged crimes under the Rome Statute occurring on its territory, should the Court choose to exercise it. The first declaration lodged by the Government of Ukraine accepted ICC jurisdiction with respect to alleged crimes committed on Ukrainian territory from 21 November 2013 to 22 February 2014. The second declaration extended this time period on an open-ended basis to encompass ongoing alleged crimes committed throughout the territory of Ukraine from 20 February 2014 onwards., I have reviewed the Office's conclusions arising from the preliminary examination of the Situation in Ukraine, and have confirmed that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with opening an investigation. In particular, I am satisfied that there is a reasonable basis to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Ukraine in relation to the events already assessed during the preliminary examination by the Office. Given the expansion of the conflict in recent days, it is my intention that this investigation will also encompass any new alleged crimes falling within the jurisdiction of my Office that are committed by any party to the conflict on any part of the territory of Ukraine., I have already tasked my team to explore all evidence preservation opportunities. The next step is to proceed with the process of seeking and obtaining authorisation from the Pre-Trial Chamber of the Court to open an investigation. An alternative route set out in the Statute that could further expedite matters would be for an ICC State Party to refer the situation to my Office, which would allow us to actively and immediately proceed with the Office's independent and objective investigations., I will also be asking for the support of all States Parties and the international community as a whole as my Office sets about its investigations. I will be calling for additional budgetary support, for voluntary contributions to support all our situations, and for the loan of gratis personnel. The importance and urgency of our mission is too serious to be held hostage to lack of means., I will continue to closely follow developments on the ground in Ukraine, and again call for restraint and strict adherence to the applicable rules of international humanitarian law., If anyone has information relevant to the Situation, this can be submitted to my Office via: otp.informationdesk@icc-cpi.int., For further details on ""preliminary examinations"" and ""situations and cases"" before the Court, click here, and here., Source: Office of the Prosecutor | Contact: OTPNewsDesk@icc-cpi.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/statement-icc-prosecutor-karim-aa-khan-qc-situation-ukraine-i-have-decided-proceed

1 MARCH 2022, Following is UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to launch the flash appeal for Ukraine, in New York and online today:, In the past week, a country has been thrown into chaos, a region has been upended and the reverberations are being felt around the world. Hundreds of civilians have been killed and injured in Ukraine. Innocent people are once again paying the highest price of war. More than half a million people have fled across borders. Hundreds of thousands of women, children and men are spending days and nights underground, in basements, car parks and subway stations., Rockets are raining down on cities, including Kyiv. Electricity and water supplies have been disrupted. Roads have been damaged or destroyed by bombs. Local supply chains are broken. Food and medicine are in short supply in some areas. Strikes on an oil depot and a gas pipeline risk severe environmental damage. I thank the Member States who have welcomed people fleeing Ukraine. It is important that this solidarity is extended without any discrimination based on race, religion or ethnicity., For many people remaining in the country, life is becoming increasingly difficult and dangerous. Most places have little or no infrastructure to shelter and protect large numbers of people who arrive with virtually nothing. I commend the national and local organizations providing aid, and the Ukrainian humanitarian and health workers caring for those injured in the fighting. The international community must give them our unequivocal support. We must help Ukrainians help each other through this terrible time., United Nations agencies are staying and delivering in Ukraine. Even before the recent military offensive, humanitarian agencies were reaching 3 million people in the east. We will now expand and scale up those programmes, and establish new operations wherever they are needed, across the country. We and our partners are committed to supporting all those affected, in accordance with the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, independence and humanity., Today, we are launching two plans to help people across Ukraine and beyond. Within Ukraine, the plan requires $1.1 billion to meet the escalating humanitarian needs of more than 6 million people affected and displaced by military operations over the next three months. Outside the country, we are requesting $551 million to help Ukrainians who have fled across borders, principally to Poland, Hungary, Romania and the Republic of Moldova., Both plans include funds to boost critical medicine and health supplies, safe drinking water, shelter and protection. They are coordinated, complementary and designed for immediate implementation. I urge you to respond to these life-saving appeals. United Nations agencies and our partners are now working 24/7 to assess humanitarian needs and scale up aid, particularly to women, children, older people and those with disabilities., On Sunday, UNHCR [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] delivered its first truckload of household materials to central Ukraine, for families in evacuation shelters and others in need. UNICEF [United Nations Children’s Fund] partners are mobilizing to treat the mental and emotional damage caused by this conflict. Children may suffer life‑long trauma after witnessing war., The first shipments by the World Food Programme (WFP) are on their way from Turkey to Ukraine. WFP is building up an emergency operation to reach 3 million people with food distributions, cash and vouchers. We are now coordinating partnerships between organizations and groups inside and outside Ukraine, and surging personnel into the country. As we ramp up our efforts, it is essential that all humanitarian workers are safe and protected, and have guaranteed freedom of movement. Unimpeded access to all affected people and communities must also be guaranteed. I call on all sides to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law., In our interconnected global era, the crisis in Ukraine could have a serious impact on vulnerable people around the world. Not only because it will stretch humanitarian funding even further, but because Ukraine is a vital source of grains. The World Food Programme buys more than half its wheat from Ukraine. Disruption to the harvest could drive up prices and add to global hunger. This speaks to the urgent need for global solidarity — not only to fund humanitarian aid programmes, but to invest in peace., The most effective humanitarian relief is to silence the guns. Now, more than ever, we must intensify our efforts for peace, everywhere. I thank all countries that have taken initiatives to facilitate negotiations on Ukraine. The United Nations stands ready to support. Soldiers must return to their barracks. Leaders must turn to diplomacy. I urge all those with influence to use it to end this senseless conflict., For information media.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Mar 2022,"On February 24th, Russian military forces conducted an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The people of Ukraine have been caught in the middle of conflict for nearly 8 years, and there are currently 2.9 million in need of urgent humanitarian assistance., Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes, according to the UN Refugee Agency, and this figure — as well as humanitarian needs — is expected to rise. Prior to this latest round of attacks, most of the humanitarian needs had been centered in Ukraine’s easternmost regions, particularly in Donetsk and Luhansk, where fighting along active frontlines since 2014 resulted in civilian deaths and injuries and damage to civilian infrastructure, including critical water supplies., Here are four ways USAID is responding to the crisis in Ukraine to help the Ukrainian people during their time of need., 1. Deploying a USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team, The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has deployed an elite Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to lead the U.S. Government’s humanitarian response to the growing crisis in Ukraine, working in close coordination with European allies and partners who will be on the front lines of the response. The team, which comprises 17 disaster experts from USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, will identify critical needs, conduct humanitarian assessments, and work with partners to scale up humanitarian aid to communities affected by the conflict., 2. Providing Critical Relief Supplies, In this initial phase of response efforts, USAID is working with partners to deliver relief supplies and commodities to meet the immediate humanitarian needs. Ongoing fighting continues to damage water pumping facilities and water pipes, threatening access to safe drinking water and worsening hygiene and sanitation conditions. USAID will be delivering hygiene supplies — including soap, laundry detergent, and hygiene cloths — to help keep more than 52,000 people healthy., In addition, we already airlifted high thermal blankets from our warehouse in Dubai to Lviv, Ukraine, to help more than 23,000 displaced people vulnerable to harsh winter weather, including those displaced from their homes, people with disabilities, and older people. More commodities are on the way., 3. Providing Additional Humanitarian Assistance and Ramping Up Programs, The United States is providing nearly $54 million in additional humanitarian assistance to meet increased needs following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This aid will enable our partners on the frontlines to ramp up efforts to provide critically needed healthcare and supplies, food, safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene items, winter supplies, as well as protection for vulnerable children., Since 2014, USAID has been working with partners on the ground in eastern Ukraine to provide food, safe drinking water, hygiene materials, shelter, emergency health care, improved sanitation, and critical relief supplies to communities in need. This support helped the international humanitarian community reach more than 1.5 million people in 2021. USAID will continue working with our partners to enable them to ramp up, expand, and adapt their programs to help as many people as possible despite constantly changing conditions on the ground., 4. Coordinating Efforts with the Government of Ukraine & the International Community, To support the Government of Ukraine’s response efforts, USAID will provide technical support to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine. We are also working closely with European allies and partners who will be on the front lines of this response, as well as the United Nations and NGOs, to coordinate among various responders, identify additional needs and tailor the response to the situation on the ground., ***, The United States is committed to supporting the Ukrainian people and is one of the largest donors of humanitarian assistance in Ukraine. Since the conflict began nearly eight years ago, the U.S. has provided nearly $405 million to vulnerable communities across Ukraine, including nearly $169 million from USAID.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Mar 2022,"As delivered, Over recent days we have witnessed scenes of violence unfolding across Ukraine. All of us have seen this with mounting horror., Although attacks continue, and there remains much confusion on the ground in Ukraine, one thing is clear: millions more people now need humanitarian assistance and protection as a result of this military offensive., We therefore come together today to launch a humanitarian appeal to meet the immediate humanitarian and protection needs of children, women and men affected by this tragic conflict, including those forced into displacement and movement indeed outside their country, as we will be hearing from Filippo Grandi., The conflict is already, in these early days, having a devastating humanitarian cost., As of yesterday, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has reported at least 536 civilian casualties, and these numbers change by the hour, including at least 136 dead. People who six days before had no idea that their lives would be so engulfed., Aerial and ground attacks on towns and cities have damaged critical civilian infrastructure, including hundreds of homes, schools and health facilities., Hundreds of thousands of people have been left with no electricity or water., Bridges and roads have been damaged under military operations, cutting people off from crucial markets and critical supplies., Food shortages are already being reported in eastern Ukraine and soon in other parts of the country., As this conflict has intensified in Kyiv and other towns and cities, we know that more than 100,000 people have been internally displaced, moved and stayed within the borders of Ukraine. Although likely these figures underestimate hugely the amount of displacement., As we will be hearing from Filippo, the number of those leaving Ukraine goes up by the hour. While the scale and scope of displacement is not yet clear, UNHCR estimate that up to 4 million people might, could, leave the country. We will hear more on that in a second., The use of explosive weapons in urban areas carries a high risk of indiscriminate impact., In this increasingly dangerous operating environment, over 100 UN agencies, non-governmental organizations and partners, national partners, in Ukraine have committed to stay and deliver, as the Secretary-General said, to meet rising needs., National NGOs, civil-society organizations and religious groups are on the front lines now, today, providing hot meals, emergency kits and first aid, and trying to protect people from harm in communities that they know so well where the needs may lie., National NGOs are also working with local authorities to carry out search-and-rescue and evacuation operations., The International Committee of the Red Cross and its partners, the Ukrainian Red Cross, are delivering drinking water and essential items to people in need inside Ukraine, as well as to fleeing families., The Secretary-General has already referred to UNHCR’s deliveries in these early days in Ukraine., UNICEF, as he mentioned, is supporting mobile teams to provide care for traumatized children., So, the work goes on, the work never stops, and the people working for humanitarian agencies did not leave., Indeed, the UN and NGOs have surged, have increased their staff, and they are working around the clock to bring more in, working in Ukraine under Amin’s leadership, as we will hear in a minute., While deteriorating security has forced some of us to temporarily suspend operations, those will be scaled up as soon as access and security limitations permit. The security has been very much a high priority agenda for all of us, including for our Secretary-General., We must not forget that the latest violence comes on the back of eight years of a conflict in eastern Ukraine, which had already left 3,000 people dead and nearly 3 million people needing humanitarian assistance and protection in that region., The Secretary-General has released US$20 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund to support and inject funding into response efforts., UN agencies and humanitarian partners have also launched appeals to meet growing needs in conflict-stricken areas. Yesterday, ICRC launched its appeal for Ukraine as well, and of course we call on donors to generously fund ICRC’s life-saving work. Their support in Ukraine, as in so many other places around the world, is irreplaceable, and this is a fact that the people sitting here, and the Secretary-General, know first-hand., Neighbouring Governments, donors, the private sector and individuals are also stepping up their assistance., In an extraordinary outpouring of support, the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund, that we host as OCHA, has received more than 10,000 online donations from individuals across 90 countries, totalling over $1 million. And for OCHA, this is a signal event. This funding goes directly to local and national relief organizations. Thank you for those who made those calls., Today, we are launching a humanitarian appeal of $1.7 billion for the Ukraine crisis. As the Secretary-General said, this appeal has two components: one humanitarian appeal for needs inside the country, that I had the privilege to coordinate, and a Regional Refugee Response Plan for support in the surrounding countries, led by High Commissioner Filippo Grandi., The humanitarian appeal we are launching today for needs inside Ukraine, which will be led by Amin, calls for $1.1 billion for more than 6 million people in need with life-saving aid and protection over the next three months., We estimate that of those 6 million people, over 1 million will be probably displaced, uncertain at the moment, but that emphasizes that people who do not move also will be in need of assistance as their lives change so radically under the bombing, the fighting that goes through their cities and villages., The most pressing humanitarian needs are for emergency medical services and supplies, clean water, and shelter and protection for the displaced., To put this appeal into practice, we will need safe and unimpeded access by all humanitarian actors to all areas affected by the conflict., And you will not be surprised that we are actively negotiating with all the parties to this conflict to ensure we can reach people in need, and to ensure that this is in line with the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, operational independence and impartiality, and enshrined in international humanitarian law., And we have been reminding the Security Council of the United Nations yesterday, Filippo and I, of the need for all parties to respect international humanitarian law and take constant care to spare civilians and civilian objects from harm., In conclusion, Mr. Secretary-General, this conflict has shaken us all to the core. It is unprecedented in its scale, in its possible consequences and the urgency of its needs., By supporting this Flash Appeal with these two elements, we can demonstrate our solidarity to the people of Ukraine in their darkest hour of need., Thank you also to those many generous Governments and individuals who have already expressed their support, and I call on others to join them., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-coordinator-0
"On the Second Day of the Human Rights Council’s High-level Segment, Russia’s attack on Ukraine Continues to Dominate the Discussion",News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",1 Mar 2022,"The Human Rights Council this morning began the second day of its high-level segment, hearing from the President of Costa Rica and well as 20 dignitaries from Nigeria, Timor-Leste, Czech Republic, Guatemala, Sri Lanka, Angola, Syria, Mozambique, Namibia, Bahrain, Cyprus, Russian Federation, Denmark, Austria, Romania, European Union, Bulgaria, Republic of Korea, Portugal and the United Kingdom. Russia's attack on Ukraine continued to dominate the discussion., Some speakers unequivocally condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Russia was urged to immediately end hostilities and return to the path of diplomacy. The invasion of Ukraine by the armed forces of the Russian Federation was not only an attack on another sovereign nation, but an attack against the aspirations of the Ukrainian people to freedom and democracy. Russia should withdraw its forces immediately. Some said that Russia was becoming a global pariah. This was the consequence of Putin's war of choice., Sergey Lavrov, Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation, said that in a context of gross violations against Russian speakers and citizens in Ukraine, and the persistent refusal of the West to call the Ukrainian authorities to order, Russia could not remain indifferent to the situation of these people. In response to an appeal, Russia had decided to launch a special military operation to protect their rights, save them, and fulfil their obligations, demilitarising and de-nazifying Ukraine, so that such a thing would never happen again., Carlos Alvarado Quesada, President of Costa Rica, said the brave and humanist path was peace, and the bravest action a leader could take was to withdraw soldiers and return them to their families, and not to kill. After only a few days, there were thousands of refugees from Ukraine, and the economic impact of the conflict was being felt around the world. The economy of gas and oil was raising temperatures around the world, and now leading to people killing each other., Among other issues raised, speakers said human rights, peace, security and development were deeply intertwined and mutually reinforcing. The promotion and protection of human rights were key elements in the march to sustainable peace and security, as well as the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. International cooperation and solidarity were essential to defeat the pandemic and thus counteract the risk of losing decades of progress in human development as well as to ensure that no one was left behind. The right to life and human dignity were twin rights of global significance, and their promotion and protection guided the global progress. Climate change, environmental degradation and pollution remained among the most pressing challenges the world faced today, and were a threat for future generations, impacting all without exception. Multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core, remained the only way to achieve global peace, security and prosperity., Some speakers said that in its work, the Council had to be guided by the principles of objectivity, impartiality and non-selectivity, allowing it to facilitate genuine dialogue. Strengthening rules-based multilateralism was the only way to effectively address global issues. Peace had become one of the most important solidarity rights to build a world of tolerance, equality and hope for a better life and environment. In recent years there had been pressures, threats and conflict, making the work of promoting peace, stability and development ever more difficult., Speaking this morning were Carlos Alvarado Quesada, President of Costa Rica; Geoffrey Onyeama, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nigeria; Adaljiza Albertina Xavier Reis Magno, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste; Jan Lipavský, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic; Mario Adolfo Búcaro Flores, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Guatemala; G.L. Peiris, Minister for Foreign Relations of Sri Lanka; Esmeralda Mendonça, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of Angola; Faisal Mekdad, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates in the Syrian Arab Republic; Helena Mateus Kida, Minister of Justice, Constitutional and Religious Affairs of Mozambique, Yvonne Dausab, Minister of Justice of Namibia; Abdullatif bin Rashid Alzayani, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bahrain; Ioannis Kasoulides, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cyprus; Sergey Lavrov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation; Jeppe Kofod, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark; Alexander Schallenberg, Federal Minister for European and International Affairs of Austria; Cornel Feruță, Secretary of State for global affairs and diplomatic strategies, Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Romania; Josep Borrell Fontelles, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission; Velislava Petrova, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria; Choi Jongmoon, Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea; Francisco André, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Portugal; and Elizabeth Truss MP, Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs of the United Kingdom., The webcast of the Human Rights Council meetings can be found here. All meeting summaries can be found here. Documents and reports related to the Human Rights Council's forty-ninth regular session can be found here., The next meeting of the Human Rights Council will be at 3 p.m. this afternoon, when the high-level segment will continue., Statements, CARLOS ALVARADO QUESADA, President of Costa Rica, said the brave and humanist path was peace, and the bravest action a leader could take was to withdraw soldiers and return them to their families, and not to kill. After only a few days, there were thousands of refugees from Ukraine, and the economic impact of the conflict was being felt around the world. The economy of gas and oil was raising temperatures around the world, and was now leading to people killing each other. The safety of the world was being threatened by human action and a lack of sense. The Council and the entire international community should deploy their efforts to ensure a sustainable cease fire and dialogue so that an escalation of the conflict did not occur. The Council was a forum for dialogue., Environmental protection and the safety of those who fought to conserve natural resources needed to be ensured. In the context of the debate to fight racial discrimination, the Forum for Persons of African Descent was ever more important. Costa Rica had the door open, with no monitoring or conditions, for any human rights defender. Costa Rica was running for election to the Human Rights Council for the upcoming period, reflecting its commitment to the international community and it was at the very heart of its efforts to build peace., GEOFFREY ONYEAMA, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nigeria, said that tackling insecurity was one of the cardinal priorities of the Nigerian Government, as peace and security were essential guarantees for the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It was important to combat illicit financial flows and ensure the recovery and return of illicitly acquired assets. Referring to the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action to vigorously combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Mr. Onyeama said that it had sadly not been achieved. Nigeria strongly condemned all forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and reaffirmed its unequivocal commitment to the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration., Mr. Onyeama reiterated Nigeria's commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The promotion and protection of human rights were key elements in the march to sustainable peace and security, as well as the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. It was important to avoid the politicisation of human rights issues and double speak that were found often in the international human rights system and advocacy. They were not synonymous with the ethos of multilateralism and they were largely counter-productive to the time-honoured principles of human rights. Nigeria would continue to deepen its commitment to multilateralism and remained seized with the promotion and protection of human rights across the globe, particularly in its engagement with the Human Rights Council., ADALJIZA ALBERTINA XAVIER REIS MAGNO, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Timor-Leste, expressed deep concern and sadness for the current situation in Ukraine. All parties were encouraged to establish diplomatic dialogue so that an immediate ceasefire could be implemented. Timor-Leste called for the respect of human rights and international humanitarian law. During the struggle for independence, the Timorese people had experienced serious violations of human rights, for which the support of the international community had been irrefutable. Timor-Leste had become an example of a country that had successfully tackled the obstacles to transition to peace and justice, while preserving unwavering respect for human rights., Human rights, peace, security and development were deeply intertwined and mutually reinforcing; Timor-Leste was focused on contributing to the promotion of sustainable peace and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The Government's efforts to promote gender equality were highlighted, including the existence of the Secretariat of State for Equality and Inclusion and the adoption of several policies, such as: the National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security and the National Action Plan on Gender-Based Violence. When it came to climate change, human rights were integrated into environmental laws and policies. The COVID-19 had shown how fragile the basic rights were, including the right to life and freedom of movement. Timor-Leste had adopted the economic recovery plan, integrating the human rights approach. Timor-Leste was putting forward its candidacy to become a member of the Council for the period 2024-2026., JAN LIPAVSKÝ, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, said the priorities of the Czech Government lay on the side of the promotion and protection of human rights, both at home and worldwide. The Czech Republic supported the independence and comprehensive human rights mandate of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and her Office. Great importance was also attached to timely dealing with human rights violations and abuses wherever they occurred. It was the core business of the Council. All country situations should be treated without discrimination., The human rights situation in Ukraine was of great concern, as there was a grave violation of humanitarian law. Ukrainians should not be alone - the Czech Republic was stepping up its aid to Ukraine. Russia and Belarus were systematically fighting people who had made a choice for democracy, in their own countries as well as in their neighbourhoods. The loss of human life was deplored, and the acts on Ukrainian soil by the Russian military were condemned. The methods of combat used by the Russian military were condemned by international law, including using children as humanitarian shields and ambulances as stealth vehicles. The leaders of Russia and Belarus must be held accountable. They would lose this war. Russia must end the unjustified attack, withdraw its forces, and start respecting international law and human rights law. An independent international commission of inquiry should be established to investigate all violations of human rights., The situation of human rights was of concern around the world, including in China, where many freedoms were restricted, including the rights of minorities, both ethnic and religious. Actions of the Cuban Government to repress all forms of dissent were unacceptable. There was also concern for the situation in Afghanistan, Myanmar and Venezuela., MARIO ADOLFO BÚCARO FLORES, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Guatemala, said that the political constitution of Guatemala was categorical in establishing that the State guaranteed and protected human life. Migration was a right and Guatemala was a country of origin, transit, destination and also of return. Guatemala's principles had always been focused on full respect for human rights and especially those of migrants, regardless of the immigration status they had. Guatemala called on all States to commit to the full implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples, welcomed the creation of the Permanent Forum on Afro-descendants, and reiterated support for the need to draft a Universal Declaration that promoted full respect for human rights., On the COVID 19 pandemic, Mr. Búcaro Flores said that international cooperation and solidarity were essential to defeat the pandemic and thus counteract the risk of losing decades of progress in human development as well as to ensure that no one was left behind. Gratitude was expressed to all the countries that had provided unconditional assistance to vaccinate and care for the Guatemalan population. The Government of Guatemala strongly condemned Russia's unilateral recognition of the ""so-called separatist Republics of Ukraine"". It was important to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis, which must be resolved with respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, human rights and security of all countries. For Guatemala, prevention was essential to avoid the violation of human rights., G.L. PEIRIS, Minister for Foreign Relations of Sri Lanka, stressed that fundamental freedoms were incorporated in the constitution, and were enforced by the judicial system. Despite the threat of terrorism, Sri Lanka had restored peace, security and the rule of law throughout the country. Free and fair elections had been organised. For post-conflict healing, domestic institutions had been put in place for reconciliation and social justice. Three Universal Periodic Reviews had been carried out and mandate holders of Special Procedures had been welcomed. Sri Lanka had benefited from the expertise provided by the United Nations, chiefly provided through technical assistance and capacity building., Despite the economic setbacks caused by the COVID-19, Sri Lanka had progressed economically, according to the latest Sustainable Development Goals report. Efforts of civil society were fully taken into account and appreciated. Sri Lanka was ready to embark on new challenges, including those caused by the pandemic and ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The Council was currently under the review process. In its work the Council had to be guided by the principles of objectivity, impartiality and non-selectivity, allowing it to facilitate genuine dialogue. Sri Lanka welcomed the productive and beneficial work of the Council. However, Sri Lanka rejected those segments of the Council's work that were not helpful and punitive, such as some resolutions addressing Sri Lanka. Counter terrorism legislation had to protect the rights of persons subject to trial and investigation, so recently a bill was presented in Parliament with this aim in mind., ESMERALDA MENDONÇA, Secretary of State for Foreign Relations of Angola, said the recognition, promotion and protection of human rights throughout the world was important, and the Angolan Government worked to fulfil these principles, including a partial constitutional revision with amendments which would strengthen democracy and the rule of law, as well as the inter-dependence of the functions of the different branches of power, and ensure respect for fundamental freedoms, including secret, fair and universal elections. This would also greatly strengthen the judicial system and include a better response to the need for social justice, building a democracy in which all citizens could participate., In April 2020, Angola had launched the National Human Rights Strategy and a National Human Rights Action Plan for the period 2020-2024, in which human rights were raised to an issue of national security. In view of the success of the former, the Government had been working with civil society, leading to an increase in the number of non-governmental organizations working on human rights issues. In under two years, over 80 per cent of the planned actions for this period had been achieved. The aim of the National Human Rights Action Plan was highlighting efforts to promote and protect human rights by individuals or legal entities, raising the awareness of human rights. This was a Plan that was led by the President of Angola and included a public apology to the nation for the tragic events which bereaved thousands of Angolans in the past. Action had also been takin in the area of gender equality and the protection of vulnerable groups, and to provide health services at the municipal level. Strengthening economic, social and cultural rights was one of the Government's priorities, and it had taken a number of steps in this direction., FAISAL MEKDAD, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates in the Syrian Arab Republic, stressed the importance for the Human Rights Council to play the role agreed upon by the Member States of the United Nations when it was established. Syria regretted that Western countries were still insisting on exploiting the Council and its mechanisms to impose their double standards, and to accuse and stigmatise States of violating human rights, using these accusations as a pretext to interfere in their internal affairs. The Minister further denounced the politicised decisions targeting Syria, referring to the United Kingdom initiatives and their four billion dollars spent on disinformation campaigns targeting Syria. Syria hoped that the Council would reconsider these practices and end the work of the politicised mechanisms that it had established without the consent of the concerned State., Since 2011, Syria had been facing a systematic war meant to undermine its stability, unity and territorial integrity. ""These challenges have posed, and still have, grave repercussions on human rights in Syria, which are further exacerbated by the imposition of unilateral coercive measures on the Syrian people by the United States and the European Union, and the theft of natural and economic resources to deprive the Syrian people of their national wealth"", he said. Syria had recently completed the discussion of its third national report within the framework of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism and was currently considering the recommendations addressed to it. The national report highlighted the efforts of the Syrian State, within the available capabilities, in the field of rehabilitating areas liberated from terrorism, protecting the rights of its citizens and meeting their basic needs, addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and securing an environment that enabled displaced Syrians to return voluntarily to their homeland., HELENA MATEUS KIDA, Minister of Justice, Constitutional and Religious Affairs of Mozambique, said that in 2021 Mozambique had been evaluated for the third time within the scope of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism. As a result of recommendations adopted, the Government had sought to commit towards effective implementation to guarantee and protect citizens rights. In this context, Mozambique intended to carry out the following actions. At the Government level, an Inter-ministerial Group on Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law would be created. Within the scope of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, the National Working Group would be created and it would consist of government institutions, the private sector and civil society. Mozambique was also drawing up the National Action Plan for the implementation of the recommendations of the third cycle of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism., Mozambique intended to make available to the United Nations its modest and humble experience in the prevention, mediation and resolution of conflicts using dialogue. Mozambique reaffirmed its strong and unquestionable commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights which constituted the mission of this important organ of the United Nations system. Mozambique was aware that despite the efforts carried out, there were still challenges to create a favourable environment for the full exercise of human rights and citizenship., YVONNE DAUSAB, Minister of Justice of Namibia, said States around the world continued to grapple with the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccination rates remained very low in the developing world, and it was a positive step that the Council would discuss finding equitable access to vaccines for all countries. It was commendable that, notwithstanding the challenges presented by the pandemic, the Council continued to respond to global needs. Namibia was a core group member of the sponsors on the right to adequate housing. The Universal Periodic Review was a priority for Namibia, as it was a unique platform for constructive dialogue between States. Namibia was committed to improving the human rights of all persons within its territory and intended to accelerate improvement. The right to life and human dignity were twin rights of global significance, and their promotion and protection guided global progress. States should reconsider the imposition of the death penalty., The Special Procedures of the Council played important roles in the protection of human rights mandates. Namibia was considering extending an open invitation to all Special Procedures and mandate holders. All States had the duty to promote and protect the human rights of all people: nobody should be left out. It was appalling and unacceptable that people continued to suffer racial discrimination throughout the world in a context of global human rights. Attempts to undermine the legitimacy of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action must be combatted. As a country that played a pivotal role in shaping the women and peace agenda at the United Nations, Namibia had adopted a national action plan, recognising that this agenda was essentially about redefining the role of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict situations. The representation of women within the high-level structures of the United Nations would influence States to ensuring full participation of women and gender equality, which was impacted by gender-based violence. Namibia was committed to support all efforts aiming to eliminate all forms of gender-based violence., Climate change, environmental degradation and pollution remained among the most pressing challenges the world faced today, and were a threat for future generations, impacting all without exception. There was no justification to maintain illegal sanctions, including on Cuba and Zimbabwe., ABDULLATIF BIN RASHID ALZAYANI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bahrain, said wars and conflicts had been going on in the Middle East for more than a decade, leaving millions dead, injured, refugees and displaced, and depriving millions of young people of education, health care, shelter, peace and security. Peace had become one of the most important solidarity rights to build a world of tolerance, equality and hope for a better life and environment., The COVID-19 pandemic had put the countries of the world to a test; Bahrain had been keen to address it in a thoughtful and effective manner, taking into account all health, economic, social and educational aspects, placing at the forefront of its priorities the protection of human rights such as the right to health and safety, inclusive of all citizens and residents alike. Shelters, means for examination, treatment, and free vaccinations were provided without discrimination. Bahrain supported the advancement of women's rights and had established the Supreme Council for Women, which in turn developed national policies and qualitative plans, most notably the National Plan for the Advancement of Bahraini Women. Bahrain was currently working on finalising its fourth national report to the Universal Periodic Review, which would be reviewed in November 2022. He concluded by announcing Bahrain's candidacy for membership in the Human Rights Council for the period 2023-2025., IOANNIS KASOULIDES, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cyprus, said Cyprus unequivocally condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Cyprus called on the Russian Federation to immediately end hostilities and return to the path of diplomacy. Strengthening rules-based multilateralism was the only way to effectively address global issues. Cyprus had been living as a victim of foreign aggression and occupation for almost 50 years. The consequences and human rights violations by Turkey since 1974 were still much felt today: the fate of half of Cyprus's missing persons had yet to be determined and those forcefully displaced by the Turkish army had not been allowed to return to their homes and properties. Cyprus was seeking to become a member of this Council for the first time, between 2025 and 2027., Cyprus lay just 60 miles off the coast of Syria, which for over a decade of conflict had been beleaguered by human rights abuses. As regarded Libya, it was imperative that a new date for the postponed elections was announced, as the growing uncertainty could spiral into violence. The creation of a Special Rapporteur on climate change was crucial as it was imperative to have a human rights-based approach to mitigating the effects of climate change. Migration would remain a challenge in the years to come. Cyprus was extremely concerned about the exploitation and abuse of migratory flows by human traffickers as well as the political instrumentalization of migration by certain States. During this session, Cyprus, together with a cross-regional core group, would be presenting the triennial initiative on cultural rights and the protection of cultural heritage., SERGEY LAVROV, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, said the outrageous measures by the European Union that violated the respect of one of the fundamental rights, the freedom of movement, and the imposition sanctions were appalling. The situation of the world was deteriorating - the United States and its allies were imposing the so-called ""rules order"" on the rest of the world, with a negative impact on human rights, as illustrated on the situation in Ukraine. The regime was waging war against its own people, and those who did not agree with the neo-Nazi policies of the Government. The ultra-nationalists and neo-Nazis who had seized power in Kiev had gone unpunished, even when peaceful protestors had been burnt alive in Odessa. The West had ignored these fundamental violations of the right to life. The Russian language had been banished from schools, universities and the public sphere in Ukraine, and people who had lived in the region for centuries were seeing their rights withdrawn and were being told to go back to Russia. This was not repulsed by the enlightened West. The process of cleansing the Ukrainian Government of undesirable officials was ongoing. Legislative acts were produced allowing the Government's security agencies to crack down on dissent and ban the opposition. There were violations of the freedom of speech. The conduct of Zelenskiy was the height of blasphemy. The Government had even insinuated itself into the spiritual world, committing religious discrimination., Ukraine's consistent dissemination of neo-Nazism had been carried out with the support of Canada, the United States and the European Union, who ignored the outrageous lawlessness of Ukraine. The regime had got away with its lawless actions. The overwhelming majority of Crimean inhabitants had expressed themselves in favour of incorporation with Russia, which allowed them to express their language, religion and culture. The inhabitants of Donbass had hoped that justice would prevail and that Kiev would implement its obligations under the Minsk agreement, but Kiev had directly ignored this and continued armed provocations. In a context of gross violations against Russian speakers and citizens in Ukraine, the persistent refusal of the West to call the Ukrainian authorities to order, Russia could not remain indifferent to the situation of these people. In response to an appeal, Russia had decided to launch a special military operation to protect their rights, save them, and fulfil their obligations, demilitarizing and de-nazifying Ukraine, so that such a thing would never happen again. This was particularly important as that country was being dragged into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and had made threats against Russia., The neo-Nazi Government was clearly not a Government for the people of Ukraine. The life of every Russian or Ukrainian was no less valuable than the life of a European or American. Russia did not intend to infringe upon the rights of the citizens of Ukraine. Washington had intended to create an anti-Russia in Ukraine. Human rights were a universal constant, and could not depend on the selfish ambitions of a few who sought a selective interpretation of the United Nations Charter. The role of the Human Rights Council was to ensure that human rights issues were not used to interfere in internal affairs., JEPPE KOFOD, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark, deplored that the Council had to meet in such a tragic time in history. He condemned the Russian attack on a sovereign nation, an indiscriminate attack on civilians in an unlawful and immoral war. A generation would be impacted by the decisions that countries were making at the moment, they would ask if all did enough to support Ukraine when it mattered the most. Denmark welcomed the decision of the Human Rights Council to hold an ad hoc meeting on the situation of human rights in Ukraine in relation with the Russian aggression. The human rights of Ukrainians and of everyone worldwide, online and offline, must be protected, including during the disinformation campaign of Russia., Mr. Kofod expressed his concerns at seeing the increasing violence facing freedom of expression, of association and of beliefs; these human rights must be protected by a full engagement of the international community. Denmark urged the authorities in Russia to protect the right to peaceful assembly and to release all peaceful protestors immediately. Denmark called on the authorities in Belarus to hold accountable those responsible for violations of human rights. He further expressed concerns about the violation of human rights in other places, such as China, where he called for access for the Office of the High Commission for Human Rights, as well as in Hong Kong, and in Myanmar where he called for the end of all violence and the restoration of a civilian government. In Afghanistan, the increase of systemic violations of human rights of women, girls and minorities was concerning. Mr. Kofod took note of the positive steps implemented by the Ethiopian Government but stated his concerns for the violation of human rights in the northern part of the country., ALEXANDER SCHALLENBERG, Federal Minister for European and International Affairs of Austria, said that the invasion of Ukraine by the armed forces of the Russian Federation was not only an attack on another sovereign nation, but an attack against the aspirations of the Ukrainian people to freedom and democracy. President Putin was called on to immediately stop this senseless war. The historical revisionism, disinformation and the use of military force instead of diplomacy brought back the demons of the past. The humanitarian situation in many places, such as Belarus, Syria, Yemen, Ethiopia, Myanmar, Nicaragua and many others, was alarming and required full attention. However, the world had to ensure that the Council addressed country situations in a holistic manner. Singling out or focusing on one country through a special agenda item whereas neglecting human rights abuses in others negatively impacted the Council as a whole and should be a matter of the past., During the current session, Austria would present a resolution focusing on minorities in conflict situations. The international community must also protect those who denounced violations -- journalists, civil society and human rights defenders. The number of reporters jailed for their work had hit a new global record: in the past 12 months alone, 46 journalists had been killed. Austria continued to place women's rights and gender equality at the centre of its foreign policy. In Afghanistan, hard-won gains and achievements for women's rights were under threat. States had to ensure a human-rights based approach to new technologies -- guaranteeing that existing international legal norms were fully implemented and effective in all spheres of life., CORNEL FERUȚĂ, Secretary of State for Global Affairs and Diplomatic Strategies, Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Romania, said the promotion and protection of human rights had become more important than ever today. Romania supported a global comprehensive system of human rights - a rules-based human rights system that existed globally. Human rights were one of the three pillars underpinning the work of the United Nations. Romania strongly supported the independence of the High Commissioner and the work of her Office. Romania had reiterated its commitment to upholding human rights, fundamental freedoms and non-discrimination. It was increasingly evident that all must remain true to these fundamental truths and principles, and protect life and international security., Russia's violation of Ukraine's integrity and sovereignty had caused deep concern for the human costs of this aggression, as well as for its unpredictable implications for the human rights and humanitarian situation in Ukraine. It was the crucial duty of the Council to monitor violations of human rights. There was great concern for reports of attacks on civilian structures in Ukraine. Russia should immediately halt indiscriminate attacks. Romania was in full solidarity with the people and Government of Ukraine, and the Russian armed forces should withdraw immediately. Regarding reports of hundreds and thousands of people being arrested by the Russian authorities whilst they demonstrated against events in Ukraine, this was a violation of the right to freedom of speech. Romania was seeking election to the Human Rights Council, which was the meeting point of promises on the protection of human rights and the rule of law, and would continue to work on this, taking into account its long-standing principled position to combat racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia. Freedom of expression was today under pervasive attack globally., JOSEP BORELL FONTELLES, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission, condemned in the strongest terms Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine and stated support to the democratically elected Government of Ukraine and its efforts to defend its territory and its people. ""We stand by the women and men of Ukraine whose courage and determination are an inspiration to us all"", the High Representative said, echoing the United Nations Secretary-General's appeal to Russia to stop its aggression and the High Commissioner's words of grave concern over civilian casualties and the human rights implications of Russia's actions., Mr. Borell Fontelles also mentioned other situations where basic human rights were violated, such as in Belarus, Afghanistan, Myanmar, and northern Ethiopia. ""The European Union will not accept any efforts to undermine fundamental freedoms or existing international human rights obligations. All members of this Human Rights Council - and the United Nations Security Council - must respect the responsibility and obligations that come with their membership"" he further detailed. The Minister expressed the European Union's full support to High Commissioner Bachelet and to the independence of her office, as her office was the custodian of human rights norms. The Special Procedures were the eyes and ears of this Council and they must be allowed to do their work. Mr. Borell Fontelles further stated that multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core, remained the only way to achieve global peace, security and prosperity. He appealed to all United Nations members, big and small, to act to defend the principles and values of the United Nations and the Human Rights Council., VELISLAVA PETROVA, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria, said that the Council was a pillar of human rights protection on a global scale. Throughout the years, Bulgaria had demonstrated its commitment to human rights protection, building on the principles of international human rights law. As they were speaking, the worst crisis was unfolding in Europe. As they had witnessed, armed conflict posed a great threat to the enjoyment of human rights, and the ongoing aggression to Ukraine was no exception. The aggression was strongly condemned and support to Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty affirmed. Russia was urged to immediately cease the attacks and adhere to international law. The Council should remain seized of the matter until it was relieved., Bulgaria remained committed to fight against COVID-19 and socio-economic recovery from the pandemic. International solidarity was of crucial importance, and Bulgaria had assisted with vaccine distribution to other countries. Combat against racism and hate speech was high on Bulgaria's agenda. Acts of anti-Semitism remained rare in Bulgaria. Digital technologies were growing ever more rapidly, posing new challenges for human rights. Climate change required more discussion and action by the Council. During its membership in the Council, Bulgaria had been very active on subjects such as the rights of the child, the empowerment of women, and the rights of persons with disabilities. Bulgaria had put forward its candidature for the membership of the Council for the term 2024 to 2026., CHOI JONGMOON, Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea, said last year conflicts had broken out in many parts of the world, leading to attacks on civilians and human rights defenders. The socio-economic crisis generated by the pandemic had led to increased discrimination and poverty. The Republic of Korea strongly condemned the situation in Ukraine, and supported the urgent debate that would be held. The reports of civilian casualties were grounds for grave concern, and these could not be justified under any circumstances. There was an urgent need to protect civilians in Ukraine. The situation in Myanmar was also one for concern, and there was a need for an independent mechanism to investigate the situation. With regard to Afghanistan, the fundamental rights and freedoms of all Afghans, including women and girls, should be respected., COVID-19 had affected all areas of the globe, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was no exception. The Republic of Korea had observed the situation there with great interest, and the international community should engage the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in order to improve the situation of the people there, in particular in the north. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea should also participate in solving the situation of divided families. Over the years the Republic of Korea had brought the attention of the Council to various situations linked to developments in technology. The importance of the women, peace and security agenda was very important, and the agenda should be advanced, in particular by addressing conflict-based sexual violence around the globe., FRANCISCO ANDRE, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Portugal, lamented a ""very sad moment, the darkest since the Second World War"" and one that would have a serious impact on future generations. Portugal stood in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and would welcome Ukrainians who needed a place to continue living. Mr. Andre called on the Russian Federation to stop the invasion and return to the negotiating table. The Secretary of State also commended the United Nations for its ongoing commitment to human rights during the COVID-19 pandemic. Portugal was helping small island developing States and least developed countries through the delivery of equipment and its participation in the World Health Organization COVAX mechanism. He further stressed the importance of respecting all human rights as the only guarantee for achieving the right to development. The Secretary of State concluded by stating that his country's priorities were the elimination of the death penalty and the protection of women's rights., ELIZABETH TRUSS MP, Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs of the United Kingdom, said the United Kingdom was proud to promote human rights across the world. They had a moral duty, especially when it came to members of this Council. This implied Tibet and Xinjiang and other parts of the world, including Afghanistan. Today, the world had to face up to the urgent situation in Ukraine. As they were speaking, the unjustified aggression on Ukraine continued with Russian troops laying siege to Ukrainian cities, and missiles hitting schools and hospitals. Over 500,000 people had fled. Blood was on Putin's hands. He was breaking international law, including the United Nations Charter. He was violating human rights on an industrial scale. There were no shades of grey in this war. President Putin was waging a war against a sovereign nation. Russia was becoming a global pariah. This was the consequence of Putin's war of choice. This was a struggle for freedom of all, which was why the United Kingdom stood by proudly by Ukraine., The United Kingdom had been the first to send defence weapons and they had sent 220 million pounds, including providing Ukraine with vital medical supplies. Russia was called on to provide safe passage for civilians and unhindered access to humanitarian aid. Now was the time to come together and join forces to take decisive actions. Together they were cutting out the vast majority of Russia from the global financial system. This would be reflected on ordinary Russians and in rising interest rates. The United Kingdom and others were working to squeeze Putin's regime higher and higher, targeting him personally and his high echelons. Nothing and no one was off the table. Ms. Truss continued to outline how the Kremlin continued to clamp down on civil society, including political prisoners. Thousands of people had been arrested across the country for anti-war protests., Produced by the United Nations Information Service in Geneva for use of the information media; not an official record.

UN humanitarians call on combatants to spare Ukraine civilians as aid ramps up,News and Press Release,UN News,Protection and Human Rights,1 Mar 2022,"Well over 600,000 people have fled Ukraine in under a week, since Russia’s military offensive began, UN humanitarians said on Tuesday, as they issued an appeal to protect civilians from further bloodshed., “We know that children have been killed, we know that thousands and thousands are at risk, and we know that more children, gutwrenchingly, are going to die or be injured in this unless fighting ends,” said UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) spokesperson James Elder., Families torn apart, Speaking over his mobile phone from western Ukraine, where an exodus of families, students and migrants have been making their way westwards towards Poland, among other neighbouring countries, Mr. Elder said that the military escalation that has been reported across several Ukrainian cities would result in more children being separated from their families. “We’re going to see more fathers handing children across to border guards in Poland,” he added., Needs remain high within Ukraine, in areas most affected by the violence, Mr. Elder insisted, as widely relayed images showed what appeared to be a Russian military convoy approaching Kiev, stretching back some 60 kilometres., “The essential aim is to expand that support across Ukraine, we need that support now because the conflict (has) got out of the east, we need that to be across the other major cities,” said Mr. Elder., WFP: 3 month emergency operation, The World Food Programme (WFP) said on Tuesday it was launching a three-month emergency operation in Ukraine to provide food assistance for people fleeing the conflict., The agency is scaling up to reach up to 3.1 million civilians through the use of cash-based transfers as well as in-kind food distributions if required., WFP staff in the capital Kyiv say that food supplies are running low, with grocery store shelves almost empty. The agency plans to provide assistance through in-kind food distributions, multi-purpose cash, and food vouchers that can be used in selected shops., The first shipments of 400 tons of immediate response rations are on their way from Turkey to the Romanian and Polish border crossings with Ukraine., Some 200 tons are being sent to each location and are expected to arrive by end of week. This usually takes the form of ready-to-eat meals that do not require lots of preparation, including tinned foods and buckwheat., Support at the borders, “Right now, our support focuses on those people going to the border, getting support to Poland and Romania. We have trucks as we speak getting to the border in Poland and Romania with emergency healthcare, sanitation, education support and psychological support.”, The development came as the UN agency’s Executive Director, Catherine Russell, said that children had been killed and injured, citing reports that “hospitals, schools, water and sanitation facilities and orphanages had come under fire”, with explosive weapons being used in residential areas., According to the UN migration agency (IOM) and UN refugee agency (UNHCR), well over 600,000 have already fled the deadly and deteriorating situation inside Ukraine., “As you know the numbers are exponentially increasing, we have now over 660,000 refugees who have fled Ukraine in last six days alone,” said UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo., Largest refugee crisis this century, “At this rate, the situation looks set to become Europe’s largest refugee crisis this century and UNHCR is mobilising resources to respond as quickly and as effectively as possible.”, Echoing that message, IOM spokesperson Safa Msehli, noted that there were also an estimated “470,000 third-country nationals in Ukraine”, including a large number of overseas students and migrants working in the country., Many remain stranded inside Ukraine, although at least 6,000 third-country nationals have arrived in Moldova and Slovakia alone, Ms. Msehli said., She noted that several States had requested the UN agency’s assistance to help with the return of their citizens to Africa, the Middle East and Asia., “More than 50 Tunisian nationals who crossed into Moldova are being assisted by IOM to relocate to Romania before they return home through a charter flight, in coordination with relevant authorities,” Ms. Msehli added., Spare civilian life: WHO, Highlighting concerns that hospitals, health workers and sick people have been targeted in the Russian “offensive”, the World Health Organization (WHO) insisted on the sanctity of civilians and civilian infrastructure., ""We are concerned about reports on attacks on health. We have received several unconfirmed reports of attacks on hospitals and health infrastructure, but only the attack on 24 February has been verified,” said Christian Lindmeier, WHO spokesperson., Since the start of the hostilities on 24 February and midnight on 1 March, the UN rights office, OHCHR, has confirmed 536 civilian casualties across Ukraine, including 136 civilians killed, of whom 13 were children., More than 500 civilians killed, Since the start of the hostilities on 24 February, the UN rights office, OHCHR, has confirmed 536 civilian casualties across Ukraine, including 136 civilians killed, including 13 children., “Most of these casualties were caused by the use of explosive weapons with a wide impact area”, said OHCHR spokesperson Liz Throssell. “This includes shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems and airstrikes.”, Away from the violence and bloodshed, solidarity from “everyday Ukrainians” with most of the newly displaced has been “extraordinary”, UNICEF’s Mr. Elder reported., Solidarity, “I’ve seen grandmothers cooking food in the road, I see people offering a bed to those at the train station, I’ve seen teenage girls making cookies and knocking on car doors offering them to people who’ve come and spent three days covering the 500 kilometres from Kiev.”, Nonetheless, UN officials have condemned reports that many foreign students from Africa and migrants living and working in Ukraine have been mistreated and abused by officials while trying to join the exodus., “Discrimination and racism are absolute wrongs and the High Commissioner (of Human Rights) and our Office have been very vocal in calling this out,” said Liz Throssell, spokesperson for the human rights office, OHCHR., “With regard to the situation that may be happening on the borders, that is clearly something to be monitored,” she said. “But I think the call would be that everyone should be allowed to enter (a foreign country) without discrimination based on race or ethnicity.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/un-humanitarians-call-combatants-spare-ukraine-civilians-aid-ramps

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Mar 2022,"El siguiente contenido corresponde a las declaraciones formuladas hoy por un portavoz de ACNUR en una rueda de prensa en el Palacio de las Naciones, en Ginebra., Unos 660.000 refugiados han huido de Ucrania a los países vecinos en los últimos seis días, según los últimos datos gubernamentales recopilados por ACNUR, la Agencia de la ONU para los Refugiados., De seguir a este ritmo, esta situación podría convertirse en la mayor crisis de refugiados de Europa en lo que va de siglo, y ACNUR está movilizando recursos para responder de la forma más rápida y eficaz posible., Hasta la fecha, todos los países vecinos han mantenido abiertas sus fronteras para aquellos refugiados que huyen de Ucrania, lo cual es de agradecer. La mayoría ha huido hacia Polonia, Hungría, Moldavia, Rumanía y Eslovaquia, mientras que otras personas refugiadas se han desplazado hacia otros países europeos. También sabemos que un número considerable se ha trasladado a la Federación Rusa. Las autoridades nacionales están asumiendo la responsabilidad del registro, la recepción, el alojamiento y la protección de estos refugiados., ACNUR insta a los gobiernos a seguir manteniendo el acceso al territorio para todos los que huyen: tanto ucranianos como nacionales de terceros países que viven en Ucrania y que ahora se ven obligados a escapar de la violencia. Es importante enfatizar que no debe haber discriminación contra ninguna persona o colectivos., La Agencia de la ONU para los Refugiados tiene presencia en la región desde hace mucho tiempo, con oficinas en Polonia, Hungría, Moldavia, Eslovaquia y Rumania ACNUR está coordinando la respuesta sobre refugiados con otras entidades de la ONU y ONG socias, para apoyar a las autoridades nacionales. Estamos reforzando nuestras operaciones con más recursos, personal y artículos de primera necesidad que se despliegan en la región, al tiempo que nos preparamos para poder proporcionar asistencia en efectivo mediante tarjetas, según sea necesario. Los equipos de ACNUR especializados en protección y bienestar de la infancia también están listos para apoyar a las autoridades nacionales., En Polonia:, Los equipos en terreno de ACNUR informan de colas kilométricas en la frontera del lado ucraniano. Las personas que van cruzando la frontera informan de hasta 60 horas de espera para poder alcanzar el punto fronterizo. La mayoría de los que llegan son mujeres, niñas y niños procedentes de todas las partes de Ucrania. Las temperaturas son gélidas y muchos de estos refugiados han explicado que han pasado días en la carretera a la espera de cruzar. ACNUR está en contacto con las autoridades, que han puesto asistencia a su disposición. También está trabajando con socios dentro de Ucrania para movilizar equipos que distribuyan asistencia humanitaria. Cuando los refugiados llegan a la frontera, las autoridades proceden a su registro de datos. El ACNUR es consciente de las dificultades a las que se enfrentan algunos nacionales de terceros países que intentan entrar en Polonia y está en contacto con las autoridades para garantizar que todas aquellas personas que necesitan protección internacional tengan acceso a los procedimientos. Los refugiados que cuentan con recursos económicos han podido encontrar alojamiento por su cuenta, mientras que otras personas están siendo acogidas por comunidades locales que han abierto sus casas, o siendo alojadas en centros de recepción habilitados., ACNUR está presente en la frontera de Polonia con Ucrania desde el 24 de febrero para monitorear las tendencias de las llegadas y está trasladando los materiales de ayuda humanitaria de sus reservas a nivel internacional hasta almacenes que tiene alquilados en la frontera (en Rzeszow). La oficina de ACNUR en Polonia se ha visto desbordada de solicitudes de información y apoyo por parte de personas refugiadas que van llegando y se está proporcionando a los recién llegados información y servicio legal a través de una agencia socia polaca, especializada en temas legales., En Hungría:, ACNUR está presente en la frontera, evaluando el número de llegadas de refugiados, y está preparado para aumentar su apoyo operativo al Gobierno. Las llegadas son constantes y los tiempos de espera varían. A su llegada, y tras el proceso de control y registro, los ciudadanos ucranianos y de otras nacionalidades son derivados a puntos de encuentro donde pueden solicitar asilo y donde se les proporciona documentación temporal. Los actores humanitarios municipales y los miembros de las comunidades de acogida están prestando este apoyo., En Rumanía:, Se están registrando colas de hasta 20 horas para entrar a Rumanía. Las autoridades nacionales están gestionando el transporte y el alojamiento, trasladando a los recién llegados desde la frontera hasta los centros de acogida o a otros lugares. Las comunidades locales también están ayudando generosamente con el transporte y el alojamiento, mientas que empresas privadas están sufragando el alojamiento en hoteles. Los voluntarios están prestando servicios de interpretación y otras formas de apoyo práctico. ACNUR y sus socios han establecido una presencia en los principales puntos fronterizos: actualmente estamos desplegados en Siret e Isaccea. ACNUR forma parte del grupo de trabajo dirigido por el gobierno que coordina las necesidades y el apoyo. Proporcionamos a los recién llegados información sobre los procedimientos de asilo y, a través de nuestros socios, ofrecemos asesoramiento jurídico y apoyo psicológico. ACNUR también ha establecido una línea telefónica de emergencia 24/7 y páginas online en ucraniano sobre la ayuda para los refugiados., En Moldavia:, Se sigue tardando 24 horas en recorrer los aproximadamente 60 kilómetros que separan Odesa de la frontera con Moldavia. Los recién llegados están siendo alojados en centros de acogida temporales, al tiempo que se están identificando otros espacios. Algunos refugiados han podido encontrar su propio alojamiento o están siendo acogidos por las comunidades locales. ACNUR está prestando apoyo para mejorar la capacidad de recepción y está distribuyendo materiales humanitarios de primera necesidad, como mantas, sacos de dormir y artículos de higiene. Está previsto que mañana llegue un puente aéreo desde Dubai con más suministros de ayuda humanitaria. Los socios de ACNUR también están presentes en varios pasos fronterizos de Moldavia, proporcionando asesoramiento a los refugiados recién llegados., En Eslovaquia:, Desde el 24 de febrero, ACNUR está realizando visitas regulares a cuatro de los cinco principales puestos fronterizos. Si bien las llegadas a Eslovaquia son menos numerosas, el gobierno mantiene una política abierta y acogedora hacia los refugiados y ha modificado rápidamente las leyes de asilo para ayudar a acelerar los procedimientos de asilo. Las comunidades locales también están prestando apoyo económico y material a los refugiados con alimentos y artículos de higiene, y ofrecimientos de transporte y alojamiento gratuitos. Los municipios y pueblos locales también están estableciendo refugios temporales para las personas refugiadas., En Ucrania:, ACNUR también está intensificando su respuesta en Ucrania para ayudar a las personas desplazadas y afectadas por el conflicto. Sin embargo, la inestabilidad de la situación, los problemas de seguridad, la falta de acceso seguro para los trabajadores humanitarios y las restricciones de movimiento están planteando grandes desafíos para los trabajadores humanitarios, incluido el personal de ACNUR. La Agencia de la ONU para los Refugiados sigue prestando ayuda cuando se dan las condiciones mínimas de seguridad, proporcionando cierta asistencia y llevando a cabo actividades de protección, como el trabajo con los líderes de las comunidades de desplazados internos para evaluar las necesidades humanitarias e identificar los lugares seguros donde se puede recibir a los desplazados internos. ACNUR también se está preparando para prestar asistencia a los desplazados internos en el oeste de Ucrania, donde el acceso humanitario es más fácil, y también está reforzando las líneas telefónicas de emergencia en todo el país para proporcionar información crítica sobre protección a los civiles desplazados., Material audiovisual: https://media.unhcr.org/Share/m6w7850exbh0x45q2m65su40b8f2335g Para obtener más información con respecto a este tema, por favor contacte con:, En la frontera de Polonia, Chris Melzer, melzer@unhcr.org; +49 (30) 202 202 10

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Mar 2022,"Ceci est un résumé des déclarations du porte-parole du HCR Shabia Mantoo – à qui toute citation peut être attribuée – lors de la conférence de presse du 01 mars 2022 au Palais des Nations à Genève., Environ 660 000 réfugiés ont fui l’Ukraine vers les pays voisins au cours des six derniers jours, selon les dernières données gouvernementales compilées par le HCR, l’Agence des Nations Unies pour les réfugiés., À ce rythme, la situation pourrait devenir la plus grande crise de réfugiés du siècle en Europe. Le HCR mobilise des ressources pour répondre aussi rapidement et efficacement que possible., Tous les pays voisins ont jusqu’à présent gardé leurs frontières ouvertes pour les réfugiés fuyant l’Ukraine, ce qui est louable. La plupart ont fui vers la Pologne, la Hongrie, la Moldavie, la Roumanie et la Slovaquie, tandis que d’autres se sont dirigés vers divers autres pays européens. Nous savons également qu’un nombre non négligeable de personnes se sont déplacées vers la Fédération de Russie. Les autorités nationales assument la responsabilité de l’enregistrement, de l’accueil, de l’hébergement et de la protection de ces réfugiés., Le HCR exhorte les gouvernements à continuer à permettre l’accès au territoire pour tous ceux qui fuient : Ukrainiens, et ressortissants de pays tiers vivant en Ukraine et forcés de fuir pour échapper à la violence. Nous insistons sur le fait qu’il ne doit y avoir aucune discrimination envers toute personne ou groupe., Le HCR est présent depuis longtemps dans la région, notamment en Pologne, en Hongrie, en Moldavie, en Slovaquie et en Roumanie, et coordonne les opérations de soutien aux réfugiés avec d’autres agences des Nations Unies et des ONG partenaires, en appui aux autorités nationales. Nous renforçons nos opérations en envoyant d’urgence davantage de ressources, de personnel et d’articles de secours à déployer dans la région, tout en nous préparant à fournir une assistance en espèces par le biais de cartes si nécessaire. Les spécialistes du HCR en matière de bien-être et de protection de l’enfance sont également prêts à soutenir les autorités nationales., En Pologne :, Le personnel du HCR sur le terrain fait état de kilomètres de files d’attente à la frontière du côté ukrainien. Ceux qui ont traversé la frontière ont déclaré avoir attendu jusqu’à 60 heures. La plupart des arrivants sont des femmes et des enfants provenant de toutes les régions d’Ukraine. Les températures sont glaciales et nombre d’entre eux déclarent avoir passé des jours sur la route en attendant de pouvoir traverser. Le HCR est en contact avec les autorités qui ont fourni une assistance. L’Agence travaille également avec des partenaires en Ukraine afin de mobiliser des équipes pour distribuer cette assistance. À leur arrivée, les réfugiés sont enregistrés par les autorités. Le HCR est conscient des difficultés rencontrées par certains ressortissants de pays tiers cherchant à entrer en Pologne. Un contact permanent est maintenu avec les autorités pour s’assurer que toutes les personnes ayant besoin d’une protection internationale aient accès aux procédures. Les réfugiés qui en ont les moyens trouvent leur propre logement. Certains sont accueillis par des communautés locales qui ont ouvert leurs maisons et d’autres sont hébergés dans des centres d’accueil., Le HCR est présent à la frontière entre la Pologne et l’Ukraine depuis le 24 février pour surveiller les tendances d’arrivée et il achemine des fournitures de secours depuis ses stocks mondiaux vers un entrepôt nouvellement loué à la frontière (à Rzeszow). Notre bureau en Pologne a été submergé de demandes d’information et de soutien de la part de réfugiés. Le HCR fournit aux nouveaux arrivants des informations et des services juridiques par le biais d’un partenaire juridique polonais., En Hongrie :, Le HCR est présent à la frontière, évaluant le nombre de réfugiés, et se tient prêt à intensifier son soutien opérationnel au gouvernement. Les arrivées sont régulières et les temps d’attente varient. À l’arrivée, après l’enregistrement, les Ukrainiens et les ressortissants d’autres pays sont guidés vers des points de rassemblement où ils peuvent demander l’asile et recevoir des documents temporaires. Le soutien est fourni par du personnel humanitaire des municipalités et des membres de la communauté., En Roumanie :, Des files d’attente allant jusqu’à 20 heures sont observées pour entrer en Roumanie. Les autorités nationales gèrent l’hébergement et le transport - les nouveaux arrivants sont transférés de la frontière vers des centres d’accueil ou d’autres lieux. Les communautés locales contribuent généreusement au transport et à l’hébergement, tandis que les entreprises privées paient des hébergements dans les hôtels. Des bénévoles fournissent des services d’interprétation et d’autres formes de soutien pratique. Le HCR et ses partenaires ont établi une présence à tous les principaux postes frontaliers - nous sommes actuellement déployés à Siret et à Isaccea. Nous faisons partie de l’équipe spéciale dirigée par le gouvernement qui recueille les besoins et coordonne le soutien. Nous fournissons aux nouveaux arrivants des informations sur les procédures d’asile et, par le biais de nos partenaires, nous offrons des conseils juridiques et un soutien psychologique. Nous avons également mis en place une ligne d’urgence 24h/24 et 7j/7 et des pages d’aide en ligne pour les réfugiés en ukrainien., En Moldavie :, Il faut toujours 24 heures pour parcourir les quelque 60 km qui séparent Odessa de la frontière avec la Moldavie. Les nouveaux arrivants sont hébergés dans des centres d’accueil temporaires et des sites supplémentaires sont en cours d’identification. Certains ont trouvé leur propre logement ou sont accueillis par des communautés locales. Le HCR apporte son soutien pour renforcer les capacités d’accueil et distribue des articles de secours essentiels, notamment des couvertures, des sacs de couchage et des articles d’hygiène. Un pont aérien en provenance de Dubaï devrait arriver le mercredi 2 mars avec davantage de fournitures. Les partenaires du HCR sont présents à divers postes-frontières moldaves et fournissent des conseils aux réfugiés nouvellement arrivés., En Slovaquie :, Depuis le 24 février, le HCR a régulièrement visité quatre des cinq principaux points de passage frontaliers. Les arrivées en Slovaquie sont moins nombreuses mais le gouvernement maintient une politique ouverte et accueillante envers les réfugiés, et a rapidement modifié sa législation sur l’asile afin d’accélérer les procédures d’asile. Une aide financière et matérielle est également apportée par les communautés locales, qui soutiennent les réfugiés en leur fournissant de la nourriture et des articles d’hygiène, en leur proposant des transports gratuits et un hébergement. Les municipalités et villages créent également des abris temporaires pour les réfugiés., En Ukraine, Le HCR intensifie également sa réponse en Ukraine pour aider les personnes déplacées et affectées par le conflit. Mais la situation instable, les problèmes de sécurité, l’absence d’accès sécurisé pour les travailleurs humanitaires et les restrictions de mouvement posent des défis majeurs aux travailleurs humanitaires, y compris au personnel du HCR. Le HCR continue d’intervenir lorsqu’il est possible de le faire en toute sécurité, en fournissant une assistance et en s’engageant dans des activités de protection, comme le travail avec les leaders communautaires pour évaluer les besoins humanitaires et identifier des sites sûrs où les déplacés internes peuvent être accueillis. Le HCR se prépare également à fournir une assistance aux personnes déplacées à l’intérieur du pays dans l’ouest de l’Ukraine, où l’accès humanitaire est plus facile, et renforce également les lignes d’assistance téléphonique à l’échelle nationale pour fournir des informations de protection essentielles aux civils déplacés., Séquences vidéo : https://media.unhcr.org/Share/m6w7850exbh0x45q2m65su40b8f2335g, Pour de plus amples informations à ce sujet, veuillez svp contacter :, A la frontière polonaise, Chris Melzer, melzer@unhcr.org ; +49 (30) 202 202 10

Protection and Human Rights",1 Mar 2022,"Introduction, The invasion of Ukraine on the 24th of February came as a shock to the country and the world. This Rapid Gender Analysis Brief seeks to draw the attention of those engaged with Ukraine in humanitarian operations to the most significant gender issues - both existing and emerging - and propose measures to address them., Like all military operations, this one will take its toll on many communities within Ukraine, with distinct effects on women, men, children and marginalised groups. The starkest example is the current contrast between the requirement that Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 years stay and join the fighting, and media images of mostly women, children and the elderly fleeing the country., Ukraine has made modest gains on women’s rights in recent years and has a developing state-level ‘gender machinery’. These gains were already under threat from deeply entrenched and persistent gender and discrimination-based inequalities, eight years of conflict in the east of the country, and the gendered social and economic stress wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. This current crisis, with mass displacement inside and outside Ukraine, will add to that complex situation and put pressure on any gains that have been made., Humanitarian actors need to build on the advances in gender equality and women’s empowerment by Ukrainian women’s rights, women-led and civil society organisations, and work with them to identify and respond to the different humanitarian needs of women, men, boys, girls and people of all genders. This Rapid Gender Analysis Brief for Ukraine and the Gender in Crisis Ukraine infographic are a first attempt to identify the gender, age, and diversity issues so that humanitarian responses can better meet people’s different needs as the crisis evolves.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/rapid-gender-analysis-ukraine

Pour faire face à cette hausse soudaine et massive des besoins, les deux organisations lancent un appel conjoint de 250 millions de francs suisses (272 millions de dollars US)., Le CICR cherche à lever 150 millions de francs suisses (163 millions de dollars US) pour financer les opérations qu'il entend mener en 2022 en Ukraine et dans les pays voisins., Le directeur général du CICR, Robert Mardini, a déclaré : « L'escalade du conflit en Ukraine a des conséquences dévastatrices. Le nombre de victimes ne cesse d'augmenter, et les structures de santé peinent à faire face à l'afflux de blessés. Nous constatons déjà des perturbations durables dans l'approvisionnement en eau et en électricité. Les gens qui appellent notre hotline en Ukraine ont désespérément besoin de nourriture et d'un toit.

"UN Special Representative Pramila Patten expresses concern about the impact of escalating violence in Ukraine, especially on women and girls",News and Press Release,OSRSG Sexual Violence in Conflict,Protection and Human Rights,28 Feb 2022,"New York, 28 February 2022: United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Pramila Patten, is gravely concerned about the rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine and urgently calls for the protection of civilians, especially women and girls, who are disproportionately affected by armed conflict and displacement. “This conflict is already severely impacting the safety and security of civilians, especially women and girls, who are at heightened risk of violence”, stated Special Representative Patten. “I call on all parties to uphold the human rights and dignity of all people, exercise restraint, and ensure full compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law, including the categorical prohibition of all forms of sexual violence”, she added., The fighting has compelled displacement on a massive scale, forcing many civilians to flee their homes, including to neighbouring countries. Unless the conflict ceases, thousands of additional families will be forcibly displaced, dramatically escalating the scale of the already dire humanitarian situation, and increasing the risk of sexual violence and exploitation., “I echo the appeal of the UN Secretary-General for an immediate cessation of hostilities and call for unhindered humanitarian access to those in need, especially women and girls. I further call on all parties to refrain from attacking essential healthcare and other civilian infrastructure, which is critical to ensuring sustained access to services, including sexual and reproductive health care and psychosocial support for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence”, Special Representative Patten said. “I call for the prioritization of life-saving support for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence within the humanitarian response”, she concluded., For media inquiries, please contact:, Ms. Géraldine Boezio, Office of the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Tel: +1 917 367 3306 Email: geraldine.boezio@un.org, Follow us on social media: @endrapeinwar",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/un-special-representative-pramila-patten-expresses-concern-about-impact-escalating

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Mar 2022,"This Flash Appeal has been revised – please see the current version here, Crisis overview, The security situation in Ukraine deteriorated rapidly following the launch of a Russian Federation military offensive on 24 February 2022. The armed violence escalated in at least eight oblasts (regions), including Kyivska oblast and the capital city of Kyiv, as well as in the eastern oblasts Donetska and Luhanska which were already affected by conflict., The intense military escalation has resulted in loss of life, injuries and mass movement of civilian population throughout the country and to neighbouring countries, as well as severe destruction and damage to civilian infrastructure and residential housing. Public service provision - water, electricity, heating and emergency health and social services - is under severe pressure, and people’s access to health care is limited by insecurity. Primary services such as banking, social transfers and transport have been affected, as have basic services, such as health, water, and electricity, and local administration. With the continuation of the military operation and mounting insecurity, supply chains are likely to be disrupted for a prolonged period of time. The ability of local authorities to sustain a minimum level of services has also been severely hampered, as employees have fled or can no longer access their workplace., The ongoing armed violence and rapidly deteriorating security environment throughout the country has put hundreds of thousands of people’s lives at risk. The expansion of the conflict is projected to deepen and expand humanitarian needs among millions of Ukrainians. It is also exacerbating human suffering in eastern Ukraine, an area which has already been exposed to eight years of armed conflict, isolation of communities, deteriorating infrastructure, multiple movement restrictions, high levels of landmine and unexploded ordnance-contamination, and the impact of COVID-19. In these conflict-affected oblasts, some 2.9 million people were already in need of humanitarian assistance prior to the latest escalation in violence., The humanitarian community has prepared for and is rapidly adapting to the unfolding situation, based on the Inter-Agency Contingency Plan updated in early 2022 ahead of the onset of the crisis. As anticipated in a worst-case scenario, the violence has prompted a steep escalation in needs and a significant expansion of the areas in which humanitarian assistance is required compared to the 2022 HRP. The type of needs and humanitarian activities required in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts have also shifted as a result of the new extent of hostilities., For a rapid scale-up of principled and effective humanitarian response in existing and new areas of Ukraine for a duration of the three months from March to May 2022, humanitarian partners require US$1.1 billion to help more than 6 million people in need. Immediate and urgent funding will be crucial for meeting existing and new humanitarian needs of millions of civilians caught in the middle of escalated hostilities. The funding currently available for humanitarian operations in Ukraine is extremely limited, with the 2022 HRP funded with less than $18 million (9.2 per cent of requirements as of 26 February 2022)., Most affected areas, The escalating insecurity affects the capital and a vast area of Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, as well as multiple new locations referred to as “newly impacted areas”, including but not limited to Kyivska, Kharkivska, Khersonska, Mykolaivska, Odessa, Sumy, and Zhytomyrska oblasts., Affected population, The intensity of the armed violence in Ukraine is having a severe humanitarian impact on the population. As a result of insecurity, people are fleeing from their homes in high-risk and the most-exposed areas in search of safety, many of whom were already displaced multiple times by previous fighting. As of 27 February 2022, at least 368,000 people have already crossed into neighboring countries, according to UNHCR. Many more continue moving towards Ukraine’s borders., Particularly vulnerable groups include older persons and persons with disabilities, who may be unable to flee or may stay in the impacted areas, resulting in risks to their lives, struggles to meet daily needs and challenges in accessing humanitarian assistance. Women and girls, already susceptible to various forms of gender based violence, particularly transactional sex, survival sex and sexual exploitation and abuse, will be even further at risk of gender based violence, including conflict related sexual violence. The remaining population, even those currently not directly affected by security incidents and fighting, are facing reduced or disrupted services, with water, heating, electricity supply as well as transportation and telecommunications badly affected. Health services – already massively weakened by the cumulative effects of years of conflict as well as the multiple waves of COVID-19 – have also deteriorated rapidly due to shortages of medical supplies and personnel relative to the current scale of needs. Access to emergency medical services, including reproductive health services, has become even more challenging amid insecurity. Local authorities’ capacities to provide social protection services are overstretched, partially due to the impact of the recent decentralization. The disruption of basic services, as well as significant infrastructure and economic losses, is not only exacerbating the pre-existing humanitarian situation, but also generating critical new humanitarian needs that must be addressed urgently., In Donetska and Luhanska oblasts, most of the vulnerable population are older persons who, according to the demographics of the area and associated vulnerabilities analyzed and documented in the 2022 HNO and HRP, constitute over 30 per cent of people in need (the highest proportion compared to other global emergencies), with others being persons with disabilities, women and children. Due to the ongoing military offensive, males aged between 18 and 60 years old are banned from leaving the country, even if they manage to reach the border. There are reports of families being separated., In summary, with the scale and direction of the ongoing military operation, 18 million people are projected to become affected, including up to 6.7 million people projected to be newly internally displaced. Of the affected population, 12 million people are expected to need humanitarian assistance, and 6 million with the most urgent humanitarian needs will be assisted with the resources required under this Flash Appeal, including 2.1 million IDPs covering the initial period of three months – during which time the 2022 HRP will be revised to incorporate new humanitarian needs arising from the escalation., Ongoing assessments, The Flash Appeal is based on the Inter-Agency Contingency Plan for Ukraine (last updated in January 2022). Building upon the 2022 HNO, the situation and needs analysis made use of pre-crisis and post-crisis secondary data, including ground observations and reports. The findings are summarized under the section “Main Humanitarian Needs” and detailed in the sectoral plans. Subject to the improvement of the security situation, inter-agency rapid assessments (IARAs) will be conducted and used to facilitate a shared understanding of the situation and prioritize immediate response according to emerging needs., Response efforts of the host government, The ultimate responsibility for the provision of relief to population impacted by a humanitarian crisis rests with the Government that controls the affected territory. The Ukraine Flash Appeal complements the Government’s response. This recognizes the capacity of the Government, regional and local authorities and services, as well as efforts made to alleviate needs and enhance the rights of affected population under Government leadership prior to this escalation., The Ministry for Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories (MRTOT) is responsible for facilitating the coordination of the national relief and response efforts together with line ministries and relevant departments, supported by humanitarian partners., Local authorities, particularly in western oblasts receiving people from affected areas, are monitoring movement of people and trying to accommodate and provide humanitarian response to the newly arrived, together with national and international humanitarian partners., Support already received and delivered, Government authorities, local partners, private sector, churches, local civil society, community-based organizations and individuals are playing a pivotal role in providing immediate assistance. In the areas with ongoing humanitarian operations prior to the escalation, humanitarian partners have scaled up the response to mitigate the conflict’s impact by the provision of food assistance, protection services, access to safe water, shelter and NFIs and health care., A Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) grant of $20 million and a Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) allocation of $18 million will support this Flash Appeal. On 24 February 2022, CERF already allocated $20 million for humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. The CERF allocation allows UN agencies and partners to further scale up humanitarian operations, particularly in new locations that have not previously been affected by hostilities before, and enhance supply chain capacity, in order to provide targeted humanitarian assistance to people affected by the recent surge in violence.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-flash-appeal-march-may-2022-enukru

Water Sanitation Hygiene",27 Feb 2022,"The United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Department of State, is providing nearly $54 million in additional humanitarian assistance to Ukraine following Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified further invasion of Ukraine, which is expected to trigger increased needs., This additional assistance will support our partners to provide critically needed health care, safe drinking water, sanitation, hygiene supplies, and protection for vulnerable children. This includes critical emergency health supplies to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of people, as well as emergency food assistance to meet the immediate needs of 125,000 people. It also includes a delivery of high thermal blankets this week to help more than 18,500 people, including people displaced from their homes, disabled people, and older people, stay warm during the harsh winter. This follows USAID’s announcement that it has deployed a 17-member Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to the region to lead the U.S. humanitarian response to the crisis., The United States is the single largest donor of humanitarian assistance in Ukraine. Since the conflict began in 2014, the United States has provided nearly $405 million to vulnerable communities across Ukraine, including nearly $169 million from USAID and nearly $236 million from the Department of State. This includes food, safe drinking water, shelter, emergency health care, and winterization services to communities affected by ongoing fighting. This assistance is in addition to USAID development programming, which has ramped up in the wake of the crisis to respond to cyber attacks, disinformation, threats to the energy sector, essential health needs, and to support the continued functioning of local and national government entities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/united-states-announces-additional-humanitarian-assistance-ukraine-enuk

Health",25 Feb 2022,"Direct Relief announced today that it will commit $500,000 to support health efforts in Ukraine and surrounding countries absorbing refugees fleeing violence and disruption. The organization is also in communication with regional organizations to coordinate medical support for refugee communities. Emergency Health Kits and medical backpacks for triage care are being offered up to health providers in the region, and the organization is making available its inventory of medical aid, and has humanitarian channels in Europe for further response., The organization has shipped $26 million in medical aid to Ukraine over the past six months, with the most recent cache of support arriving last week containing $5.4 million in medical aid for a Ukrainian NGO that serves hospitals, ambulance stations and medical centers. The most recent shipment included mental health and cardiovascular medications, IV fluids, and more., Direct Relief, which has staff in Europe, has been in communication with the U.N., multiple Ministries of Health, as well as local NGOs to support medical needs as they become known. Health concerns during this time include medical needs for thousands of people that have been internally displaced within Ukraine, particularly in the eastern portion of the country, and many others that have fled into refugee camps that have been established in the neighboring countries of Moldova, Poland, and others., "" Direct Relief was created out of the ashes of WWII by Europeans who fled,"" said Thomas Tighe, Direct Relief CEO and President.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Mar 2022,"This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva., Around 660,000 refugees have now fled Ukraine to neighboring countries in the past six days, according to the latest government data compiled by UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency., At this rate, the situation looks set to become Europe’s largest refugee crisis this century, and UNHCR is mobilizing resources to respond as quickly and effectively as possible., All neighboring countries have to date commendably kept their borders open for refugees fleeing Ukraine. Most have fled to Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia, while others have moved towards various other European countries. We are also aware that a sizeable number has moved to the Russian Federation. National authorities are assuming responsibility for the registration, reception, accommodation and protection of these refugees., UNHCR urges governments to continue to maintain access to territory for all those fleeing: Ukrainians, and third country nationals living in Ukraine, who are now forced to escape the violence. We stress that there must be no discrimination against any person or group., UNHCR has a long-standing presence in the region, including in Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia and Romania, and is coordinating the refugee response with other UN agencies and NGO partners, in support of national authorities. We are reinforcing our operations by urgently sending more resources, staff and relief items to deploy in the region while preparing to provide cash assistance via cards as needed. UNHCR child welfare and protection specialists are also ready to support national authorities., In Poland:, UNHCR field staff report miles of queues at the border on the Ukrainian side. Those who crossed the border said that they had been waiting up to 60 hours. Most arrivals are women and children from all parts of Ukraine. Temperatures are freezing and many have reported spending days on the road waiting to cross. UNHCR is liaising with the authorities who have made available assistance. It is also working with partners inside Ukraine to mobilize teams to distribute this assistance. When refugees arrive, they are registered by the authorities. UNHCR is aware of challenges faced by some third country nationals seeking to enter Poland and are in touch with the authorities to ensure that all those in need of international protection have access to procedures. Refugees who have the means are finding their own accommodation, whereas others are being hosted with local communities who have opened their homes, or sheltered in reception centers., UNHCR has been present at the Polish-Ukrainian border since 24 February to monitor arrival trends and is moving relief supplies from its global stocks to a newly rented warehouse at the border (in Rzeszow). Our office in Poland has been inundated with requests for information and support by refugees. UNHCR is providing new arrivals with information and legal services through a Polish legal partner., In Hungary:, UNHCR is present at the border, assessing the number of refugees, and is ready to scale up its operational support to the Government. Arrivals are steady and waiting times vary. On arrival, following screening and registration, Ukrainians and other nationalities are guided to assembly points where they can apply for asylum and are granted temporary documentation. Support is being provided by municipalities humanitarian actors, and members of the community., In Romania:, There are queues of up to 20 hours to enter Romania. National authorities are managing accommodation and transport – new arrivals are being moved from the border to reception centres or other locations. Local communities are generously helping with transport and accommodation, while private companies are paying for hotels. Volunteers are providing interpretation services and other forms of practical support. UNHCR and partners have established a presence at all main border points – we are currently deployed at Siret and Isaccea. We are part of the government-led task force that is coordinating needs and support. We are providing new arrivals with information on asylum procedures, and, through partners, are offering legal advice and psychological support. We have also established a 24/7 emergency hotline and online help pages for refugees in Ukrainian., In Moldova:, It is still taking 24 hours to cover the 60-odd kms between Odessa and the border with Moldova. New arrivals are being accommodated in temporary reception centres and additional sites are being identified. Some have found their own accommodation or are being hosted by local communities. UNHCR is providing support to enhance reception capacity and is distributing essential relief items, including blankets, sleeping bags and hygiene items. An airlift from Dubai is due to arrive tomorrow with more supplies. UNHCR’s partners are present at various Moldovan border crossings, providing counselling to newly arrived refugees., In Slovakia:, Since 24 February, UNHCR has regularly visited four out of five main border crossing points. Arrivals to Slovakia are lower but the government is maintaining an open and welcoming policy towards refugees, and has rapidly changed asylum laws to help fast-track asylum procedures. Financial and material support is also being provided by local communities, who are supporting refugees with food and hygiene items, offers of free transport, and accommodation. Local municipalities and villages are also creating temporary shelters for refugees., In Ukraine, UNHCR is also ramping up its response in Ukraine to help displaced and conflict affected people. But the volatile situation, security concerns, lack of safe access for humanitarian workers and movement restrictions are posing major challenges for aid workers, including UNHCR staff. UNHCR continues to deliver when safe to do so, providing some assistance and engaging in protection activities like working with internally displaced community leaders to assess humanitarian needs and identify safe sites where IDPs can be received. UNHCR is also preparing to deliver assistance to internally displaced people in western Ukraine where humanitarian access is easier and is also strengthening nationwide hotlines to provide critical protection information to displaced civilians., For more information on this topic, please contact:",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unhcr-mobilizing-aid-forcibly-displaced-ukraine-and-neighbouring-countries-enar
