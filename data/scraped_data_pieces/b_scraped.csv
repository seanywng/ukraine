"IAEA Inspectors Complete In-Field Verification Activities at Three Ukraine locations, No Indications of Undeclared Nuclear Activities and Materials",News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,3 Nov 2022,"Inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have completed their in-field verification activities at three locations in Ukraine at the request of the Government of Ukraine, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., Ukraine’s written requests for the IAEA to send teams of inspectors were issued after the Russian Federation made allegations about activities at the three locations – the Institute for Nuclear Research in Kyiv, Eastern Mining and Processing Plant in Zhovti Kody, and Production Association Pivdennyi Machine-Building Plant in Dnipro., Over the past few days, the inspectors were able to carry out all activities that the IAEA had planned to conduct and were given unfettered access to the locations. Based on the evaluation of the results available to date and the information provided by Ukraine, the Agency did not find any indications of undeclared nuclear activities and materials at the locations., The inspectors also collected environmental samples for analysis at the IAEA’s safeguards laboratories and its network of analytical laboratories. Environmental sampling is a commonly used safeguards measure with ultrasensitive analytical techniques that can provide information about past and current activities related to the handling of nuclear materials., “Upon the request of the Government of Ukraine, I immediately dispatched inspectors to the three locations to carry out their indispensable technical and independent role in verifying the facts on the ground. Within days, they went there and conducted their safeguards activities, in challenging circumstances during the current conflict in Ukraine,” Director General Grossi said., “Our technical and scientific evaluation of the results we have so far did not show any sign of undeclared nuclear activities and materials at these three locations. Additionally, we will report on the results of the environmental sampling as soon as possible,” he said., Director General Grossi stressed that the IAEA remained ready to conduct further such verification activities in Ukraine to verify the absence of undeclared activities and materials and thereby deter any misuse of such materials.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iaea-inspectors-complete-field-verification-activities-three-ukraine-locations-no-indications-undeclared-nuclear-activities-and-materials
"Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant lost off-site power again, diesel generators providing back-up electricity",News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,3 Nov 2022,"Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has again lost all access to external electricity following shelling overnight and it is now receiving back-up power from its emergency diesel generators, further underlining the extremely precarious nuclear safety and security situation at the facility and the urgent need to establish a protection zone around it, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., The plant’s diesel generators started operating automatically after the plant’s connection was cut both to its main 750 kilovolt (kV) power line and to its back-up off-site power supplies from a 330 kV line that provides electricity through the switchyard of the nearby thermal power station., The 750 kV line was disconnected following shelling at around 10pm local time yesterday, and the 330 kV line shortly after midnight, Director General Grossi said, citing information he had received from the team of IAEA experts at the site., Senior Ukrainian operating staff informed the IAEA experts that there were indications that the power lines had sustained physical damage at two different locations about 50-60 kilometres from the plant itself, in Ukrainian-controlled territory. Repair work at one of the locations, where the 330 kV line was damaged, is under way., The ZNPP, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has lost external power also previously during the current conflict in Ukraine, forcing it to rely on the diesel generators until off-site electricity became available again., The plant has fuel for around 15 days of diesel generator operations, according to Ukraine’s national nuclear operator Energoatom. Currently, nine of the plant’s 20 diesel generators are operating to provide the power the plant needs for reactor cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions., Following the loss of external power, the two reactors that were in hot shutdown mode to provide steam to the plant’s operations are being transferred to cold shutdown. The four other reactors were already in cold shutdown., “This is an extremely concerning development that again demonstrates the plant’s fragile and vulnerable situation,” Director General Grossi said. “Despite the best efforts of the plant’s courageous staff to stabilize the external power situation in recent weeks, the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant has again lost all access to off-site electricity. For now, it receives the power it needs from the on-site diesel generators. But this is clearly not a sustainable way to operate a major nuclear facility. Measures are needed to prevent a nuclear accident at the site. The establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone is urgently needed,” he said., To help achieve this vital objective, Director General Grossi has engaged in high-level talks with both Ukraine and Russia in recent weeks aimed at agreeing and implementing such a zone around the ZNPP as soon as possible.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraines-zaporizhzhya-nuclear-power-plant-lost-site-power-again-diesel-generators-providing-back-electricity

Results of a representative survey among Ukrainians [EN/UK],Assessment,USAID,Protection and Human Rights,3 Nov 2022,"Implemented by Info Sapiens research agency within USAID Economic Resilience Activity, Summary, 55% of Ukrainians have access to computer equipment and reliable Internet. In Kyiv, the figure is higher - 69%. The lowest level of access is among the residents of the east - only 43% of the respondents are provided with computer equipment and reliable Internet., Respondents are much more familiar with the concept of domestic violence (80%) than with the concept of gender-based violence (46%). Women are more concerned than men about the increased risks of domestic and gender-based violence during the war, both in society as a whole and in relation to themselves., 14% of respondents encountered cases of gender-based or domestic violence since February 24, 3% of them personally or among family members. Half of them (51%) appealed to the state authorities about this issue., The proportion of people for whom wages are the main income source decreased since the full-scale invasion (from 60% to 48%). At the same time, the proportions of families whose main source of income is social assistance from the state (from 24% to 31%) and their own savings (from 3% to 6%) have increased., One-fourth of Ukrainians (26%) had to look for a job in the last three months. The most frequent obstacles in this process were low salaries offered by employers (34%) and a lack of vacancies in the specialty (34%)., About 35% of the respondents would like to change their profession if given the opportunity. In rural areas, the most desired new job sector was agriculture (10%). In large cities with a population of 101,000 to 500,000 and more than 500,000, IT, trade and marketing are the most desirable. In cities with a population of 51,000 to 100,000, respondents more often chose the service sector and other industries., 46% of the Ukrainians would like to start their own business or are already working on it. Among women, the portion of such people is smaller (36%) than among men (57%). Among the obstacles to creating one's own business, the impossibility of planning in the conditions of war (24%) was most often mentioned, in addition, many respondents lack a material base (18%) and working capital (18%)., Most respondents agree that work is a source of stability for many (90%) and that company owners, management and employees must work together for their company's survival (87%). At the same time, 43% believe that company management does not care about employees and 48% agree that management took advantage of wartime to reduce or not pay salaries to employees. Older respondents over the age of 60 show a somewhat more negative attitude towards employers, less likely to agree that company management communicates the market situation to employees in clear language, develops strategies to support the sustainability of the company and keeps its word.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/results-representative-survey-among-ukrainians-enuk

"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (22-28 October 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,3 Nov 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, Russian forces continued to launch strikes against civilian infrastructure amid the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Along the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, ceasefire violations decreased compared to the week prior. In Kyrgyzstan, demonstrations over a planned border deal with Uzbekistan continued, triggering a crackdown from the Kyrgyz authorities. Meanwhile, the death of Mahsa Amini, rising living costs, climate grievances, and immigration continued to spark demonstrations across Europe., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. Ukrainian forces conducted ground attacks near Svatove and Kreminna in the Luhansk region, advancing their positions in the area (ISW, 25 October 2022). Russian forces continued offensive operations in the direction of Bakhmut and Avdiivka in the Donetsk region (RFE/RL, 26 October 2022)., Russian forces continued to target civilian infrastructure across Ukraine with shelling, missiles, and drone strikes, reportedly killing over a dozen civilians last week in the Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Additionally, on 24 October, Russian forces stopped and shot at a civilian car in the Kherson region, reportedly killing two people and wounding a child (Suspilne Media, 25 October 2022). Russian forces also continued to abduct civilians from the occupied regions last week. Russian forces reportedly forcibly relocated patients of a psychoneurological residential care facility in the Kherson region to an unknown location (Suspilne Media, 26 October 2022)., In Russia, the governor of Belgorod accused Ukrainian forces of shelling border villages on six different occasions, reportedly killing two residents (TV Rain, 22 October 2022; TV Rain, 25 October 2022). This violence contributed to the 173% increase in average weekly violent events in Russia in the past month relative to the weekly average for the preceding year. ACLED’s Conflict Change Map also warned of increased violence in the country during the preceding four weeks., Demonstrations in support of Ukraine and against the invasion took place in Finland, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Montenegro, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, Russian police broke up two anti-war demonstrations in Moscow., Ceasefire violations continued along the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact last week, though their number decreased compared to the week prior. Additionally, a landmine explosion in the Tartar region of Azerbaijan injured one civilian., In Kyrgyzstan, demonstrations against a planned border demarcation agreement with Uzbekistan continued last week. Demonstrators staged multiple demonstrations against the deal in the capital city of Bishkek and in the Ozgon district of the Osh region, expressing concern that the contested Kempir-Abad (Andijan) water reservoir will be transferred to the Uzbek side. Kyrgyz authorities have since arrested 20 opposition activists and politicians, including leaders of the Reforma and Turan parties, accusing them of planning riots (RFE/RL, 25 October 2022). The government also blocked online access to Radio Free Europe’s Kyrgyz language service website ‘Azattyk,’ which actively covered the demonstrations, claiming that website inaccurately presented the military escalation on the Kyrgyz-Tajik border in mid-September (24.kg, 26 October 2022). Simultaneously, pro-government supporters organized numerous demonstrations across the country in support of the Kyrgyz president and his cabinet., Meanwhile, the death of Mahsa Amini in Iran continued to spark solidarity gatherings across Europe last week for a sixth consecutive week. Rallies in support of ongoing protests and women’s rights in Iran were recorded in Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In Germany, about 80,000 demonstrators from across Europe took to the streets in Berlin on 22 October to defend the Iranian protest movement., Climate and environmental protests continued to take place across Europe last week. In Germany, the Netherlands, Serbia, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, activists blockaded buildings and roads, conducted hand-gluing stunts, and staged sit-ins, prompting police intervention and leading to multiple arrests. Further demonstrations with similar motives were observed in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Italy, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, and Sweden., Demonstration activity linked to rising living costs, inflation*, *and energy prices also continued across the region last week, with cross-sector protests held in Austria​​, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom., Meanwhile, far-right groups attended demonstrations against immigration in multiple countries in the region last week. In France, right and far-right groups and parties continued to protest the suspected murder of a 12-year-old French girl at the hands of an Algerian immigrant, denouncing immigration and holding the state responsible for the attack. In Italy, far-right activists organized a rally in support of the protests in France in Milan.

The programme supports the most vulnerable people in Ukraine., ""As the winter grows colder and the air strikes continue, people’s survival is at stake. The price of housing and food has increased rapidly, and heating is a concern, especially in areas where homes and energy plants have been destroyed,"" Marko Korhonen, Head of International Disaster Management of the Finnish Red Cross, describes the situation., The Red Cross will allocate cash aid to people who are accommodating refugees from other parts of Ukraine for free and to veterans who were severely injured before the current crisis and whose pension does not cover everyday necessities., ""These groups were selected based on their level of vulnerability and because they do not have sufficient access to other forms of help"", Korhonen says., ""As the conflict has been prolonged, the resources of the families housing refugees have been spread thin. As for the severely injured soldiers, they receive only small sums of social security, which makes it difficult to manage when prices rise. These people also depend on assistive devices or other people, which is why they and their families are especially vulnerable."", The international Red Cross will carry out the aid programme in cooperation with the Ukrainian Red Cross and local authorities. The programme will reach over 600,000 people. Aid will be provided to registered recipients for four months., The aid sum of 10 million euros will be distributed in full by July 2023., Cash aid meets individual needs, Aid provided in cash or on a payment card is a flexible form of support in cases where people’s situations and needs may vary. The aid recipient can decide for themselves how they will use the sum received., ""In our experience, cash aid is effective since people use it for basic needs: such as food, housing, heating, medications or bus fares. In the middle of a crisis, it is also important that everyone gets to make their own decisions about their life,"" Korhonen points out., The support of 10 million euros to the cash aid programme is one of the largest single sums ever provided by the Finnish Red Cross., ""The sum is a significant one because the need for aid is immense.

"Security Council Rejects Text to Investigate Complaint Concerning Non-Compliance of Biological Weapons Convention by Ukraine, United States",News and Press Release,UN SC,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,2 Nov 2022,"9180TH MEETING (PM), SC/15095, Abstaining Delegation Says Allegations by Russian Federation Lacked Evidence, The Security Council today failed to adopt a resolution put forth by the Russian Federation to set up a commission consisting of all members of the Council to investigate its complaint about the non-compliance by the United States and Ukraine with their obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention., The draft resolution only received support from one other Council Member — China — with France, the United States and the United Kingdom voting against it, and the 10 remaining Council members abstaining from voting., Through the draft resolution, the 15-member Council would have decided to set up a commission to investigate the complaint of the Russian Federation in the context of the activities of biological laboratories in the territory of Ukraine, as well as present to the 15-member organ a report on the issue containing recommendations by 30 November 2022 and inform the States parties to the Convention at its Ninth Review Conference to be held in Geneva on 28 November–16 December 2022 of the results of the investigation., The draft would also have the Council request the Secretary-General and the Biological Weapons Convention Implementation Support Unit provide, within their respective mandates, all necessary assistance to the commission., By other terms, the draft would have the Council recall that, under article VI of the Convention, its States parties cooperate in carrying out any investigation which the organ may initiate, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, on the basis of the complaint received by the Council., Speaking before the vote, the representative of the Russian Federation said the vote represented “a considerable milestone” for the Security Council.Since his country set out its position on the issue before the Council on 27 October, two rounds of expert consultation took place on the draft, which prompted some Council Members to reach “unilateral conclusions”, he said, adding that he expected that the vote will reflect respect for international law and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, and hoped for support from Council members who do not fear angering Washington, D.C., and its satellites., Following the vote, the representative of the Russian Federation voiced disappointment that the Council did not manage to activate the mechanism provided for under article VI of the Biological Weapons Convention. Regardless of the outcome of today’s vote, his delegation will continue to make all efforts to establish all facts related to the non-compliance by the United States and Ukraine with the Convention, in the context of the activities of the biological laboratories in Ukrainian territory., The delegate of the United States agreed with the representative of the Russian Federation that the meeting marked a milestone, stressing: “It is a milestone, for the Russian Federation’s deception and lies. ”Recalling that during a consultative meeting under article V of the Biological Weapons Convention in September in Geneva her country and Ukraine went through the Russian Federation’s allegations “point by point and debunked every single one”, she added: “When they failed in Geneva, they raised their false claims here, abusing its position and abusing us.”, Echoing such points, the representative of the United Kingdom said her country voted against the resolution to protect the integrity of the Convention and prevent it from being undermined by unfounded accusations. The Russian Federation’s allegations have no credible basis in fact and its long-standing disinformation efforts undermine peaceful biological cooperation under article X, she said, urging the Council to defend peaceful biological cooperation against unfounded malicious allegations., France’s delegate said his country also voted against the draft, having evaluated the so-called evidence in detail and concluding that the allegations are unfounded. “If words are stripped of their meaning, and if truth and lies are considered on an equal footing, diplomacy is no longer possible,” he stressed., The representative of Mexico stated that his country had abstained because the provisions of article VI of the Convention had not been fulfilled. Recalling that the party alleging such violations needs to provide evidence to activate the next step, he pointed out that the Russian Federation has not done so either in the debate or in the consultation process for the draft resolution., Meanwhile, the representative of China said that he voted in favour of the draft as questions put forth by the Russian Federation about biological activities taking place in Ukraine during a formal consultative meeting in September were not answered., Also speaking today were representatives of India, Ireland, Albania, Norway, Kenya, Brazil, United Arab Emirates and Ghana., The meeting began at 4:48 p.m. and ended at 5:30 p.m., Statements before Vote, DMITRY A. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation) said the imminent vote represents “a considerable milestone” for the Security Council. Recalling his country’s position on the issue, as set out on 27 October in the Council, he stated that subsequent to that meeting, two rounds of expert consultations had taken place on the draft. However, during that time, “old talking points” were aired about the Russian Federation, and the evidence it put forth was said to not merit further consideration. He stated that certain Council members reached unilateral conclusions, replacing a decision to be taken by the 15-member organ with their “biased national assessments”. He went on to state that he expected that the forthcoming vote will reflect respect for international law and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and hoped for support from Council members who do not fear angering Washington, D.C., and its satellites., Action, The Council then failed to adopt the text, as it did not obtain the required number of votes. It received 2 votes in favour (Russian Federation, China) to 3 against (United States, France, United Kingdom), and 10 abstentions., Mr. POLYANSKIY (Russian Federation) voiced disappointment that the Council did not manage to activate the mechanism provided for under article VI of the Biological Weapons Convention. Quoting its provisions, he said that, during work on the draft resolution, Western countries demonstrated in every way that the law does not apply to them. Regardless of the outcome of today’s vote, his delegation retains its questions to the United States and Ukraine, he said, adding that the evidence in his country’s complaint still require clarification. The Russian Federation will continue to act within the framework of the Biological Weapons Convention and make all efforts to establish all facts related to the non-compliance by the United States and Ukraine with the Convention, in the context of the activities of the biological laboratories in Ukrainian territory. Any violators will be held accountable by the international community. The Russian Federation will unfailingly work on further strengthening the Convention’s regime, including at the Ninth Review Conference to be held in Geneva from 28 November to 16 December., Statements, JUAN GÓMEZ ROBLEDO VERDUZCO (Mexico) stated that his country had abstained because the provisions of article VI of the Biological Weapons Convention have not been fulfilled. Recalling that the party alleging such violations needs to provide evidence to activate the next step, he pointed out that this has not happened either in the debate or in the consultation process for this draft resolution. He further noted that it is not realistic to believe that a commission can be set up as proposed and can present a report with recommendations to the Council in a period of 28 days. Nevertheless, he highlighted that the forthcoming review conference of the Convention is an ideal forum to consider the comments made by the Russian Federation., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said she voted against the draft, as “it is based on disinformation, dishonesty, bad faith and a total lack of respect to this body”. Underscoring the importance of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, she said her country takes its responsibilities as a State party seriously and fulfils its obligations accordingly, assisting partners in strengthening health security and reducing the impact of infectious disease, adding: “Such cooperation must not be stigmatized.” During the consultative meeting held on article V in Geneva, the Russian Federation failed to present evidence to support its false allegations, she said. Despite that country’s abuse of the process, her country and Ukraine went through the Russian Federation’s allegations “point by point and debunked every single one”. Therefore, she continued, this meeting is a milestone, as the Russian Federation’s delegate said, adding: “It is a milestone for the Russian Federation’s deception and lies.” She went on, stating: “When they failed in Geneva, they raised their false claims here, abusing its position and abusing us.” Instead of focusing on such claims, the Council should focus on the truth and the horrors inflicted by the Russian Federation on the Ukrainian people, she stressed., AMARNATH ASOKAN (India) said that any matter relating to the obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention should be addressed as per the Convention and through consultations and cooperation between the relevant parties. He underscored the need to negotiate a comprehensive legally binding protocol providing for an effective, universal and non-discriminatory verification mechanism. This is necessary to strengthen the Convention and its implementation by States parties, he said, voicing hope that the current situation will provide the impetus for early consideration, negotiation and finalization of such a protocol by the States parties. Factoring these various aspects, India decided to abstain from voting on the resolution, he said., CAÍT MORAN (Ireland) stressed that no substantive or credible evidence has been presented by the Russian Federation to support its allegations, either through the article V consultative meeting in Geneva in September or in the materials submitted to the Council. She added that her country had abstained because it does not see the proposed investigation by the Council as either justifiable or useful. Noting that Moscow is attempting to misuse the Convention and the Council as a platform for its disinformation to justify its unjustifiable and unlawful invasion of Ukraine, she asked to stop these deeply cynical and harmful actions that risk undermining key multilateral arms control agreements as well as international cooperation into vital health research., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said he abstained from voting on the draft as the claims put forth by the Russian Federation are unsubstantiated and uncorroborated; that country has failed to provide credible evidence to support the need for an article VI investigation. He called on the Russian Federation to end its aggression on Ukraine and bring its troops home, “instead of misusing the Council and polluting its work with disinformation and fantasies”., TRINE SKARBOEVIK HEIMERBACK (Norway) said her country abstained from voting as it does not wish to set a negative precedent in the use of article VI of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Norway has meticulously reviewed the documents annexed to the Russian complaint under article VI of the Convention, which consist predominantly of assertions, interpretations and conclusions by the Russian Federation itself. Recalling that the same accusations were dealt with in September during the formal article V consultations, she said the Russian Federation has failed to demonstrate probable cause for further investigative steps. Emphasizing that it is “deeply problematic that the State that has lodged the complaint with the Security Council itself has ‘taken the pen’ and submitted the resolution that addresses the complaint”, she called on the Russian Federation to end its “relentless campaign of disinformation and stop congesting the Council’s agenda with patently unfounded requests related to the situation in Ukraine”., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said her country voted against the resolution to protect the integrity of the Convention and prevent it from being undermined by unfounded accusations. Pointing to the Russian Federation’s false allegations of biological activities, she recalled that Ukraine and the United States provided a comprehensive response in September. The Russian Federation’s allegations have no credible basis in fact and its long-standing disinformation efforts undermine peaceful biological cooperation under article X, she stressed, urging the Council to defend peaceful biological cooperation against unfounded malicious allegations., MICHAEL KAPKIAI KIBOINO (Kenya) stressed that any actions which may undermine the Convention, especially in a world grappling with the effects of a pandemic, should be avoided, pointing to the importance of respecting existing conventions and norms that ensure international cooperation remains unimpeded. He noted that any credible allegations of the use of weapons of mass destruction should be treated with the seriousness they deserve., GENG SHUANG (China) said he voted in favour of the draft as threats to biosecurity know no borders. Recalling that the Russian Federation has been raising its allegations in the Council since March about the biological activities taking place in Ukraine, he said that any concerns about compliance with the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention deserve thorough and to-the-point clarifications by the parties concerned. Although a formal consultative meeting was held to resolve such issues in September, he said, regrettably, a set of questions put forth by the Russian Federation were not answered. Therefore, the Russian Federation submitted its allegations to the Council, which was reasonable, legitimate and should not be blocked. A fair and transparent investigation can address compliance concerns and help uphold the authority of the Convention., JOÃO GENÉSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil), noting his country’s consideration of documents made available by the Russian Federation and the discussions in Geneva, said that currently the necessary conditions for the initiation of an investigation under article VI of the Convention have not been met. Brazil is committed to the resumption of negotiations towards adoption of a binding verification protocol that strengthens implementation of the Biological Weapons Conventions regarding the exclusive peaceful use of knowledge and technologies in the field of life sciences. The situation in the Council today only reinforces the necessity of establishing such a mechanism, he pointed out, noting that the next review conference presents an opportunity for Council members to re-engage in such discussions without delay. While such a protocol is not adopted, States parties must strengthen the mechanisms of transparency and confidence-building available under the framework of the Convention by sharing the broadest range of information regarding research projects on topics related to the Convention., MOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates) stated that since article VI of the Convention has never been applied, the Council should be prudent and deliberate when establishing new precedents. He pointed out that there should be a broad agreement among Council members on the triggers and modalities to proceed with article VI.Given the lack of such an agreement on the draft resolution presented today, he noted that his country chose to abstain., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) said the results of the vote are “unassailable”, demonstrating that “nobody is duped by the Russian Federation’s lies”. France voted against the draft, he continued, adding: “If words are stripped of their meaning, and if truth and lies are considered on an equal footing, diplomacy is no longer possible.” France evaluated the so-called evidence in detail; the allegations are unfounded. These conclusions were already drawn during the consultations in this regard in Geneva, he said, adding that the Russian Federation itself said it had no new information. The Russian Federation will respond to the results of the vote by passing itself off as a victim and try to teach lessons on international law, he said, stating that this will be “risible if the facts weren’t cause for tears”. The Russian Federation is engaged in a war of aggression against its neighbour and is illegally annexing Ukraine’s territory. He called on the Russian Federation to cease its campaign of disinformation and expressed regret about that country’s instrumentalization of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana), Council President for the month, speaking in his national capacity, said he abstained from the vote, due to the nonconsensual outcome of the meeting held in Geneva, despite his country’s repeated proposition that a conclusive determination of Ukraine’s biological programmes could only be made after further assessment by relevant institutions. As a State party to the Biological Weapons Convention, Ghana believes in the right for States parties to engage in consultations and cooperate with each other to reach a solution in the event of any complaints of violations of the Convention, as agreed in article V, and is of the view that a necessary condition for the invocation of article VI, for a formal investigation into a complaint, should be a compelling prima facie case. He went on to reiterate that while he takes seriously issues related to the threat of use and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, he also acknowledges the right set out in article X of the Convention, which accords States parties the right to participate in the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for the use of bacteriological (biological) agents and toxins for peaceful purposes., For information media.

Update 122 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (31 Oct 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,31 Oct 2022,"A landmine explosion cut the main power supply connection to one of the reactors of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), in the latest incident underlining the fragile nuclear safety and security situation at the facility during the current military conflict, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today., The explosion occurred yesterday evening outside the ZNPP’s perimeter fence, disconnecting the 750 kilovolt (kV) external power line between plant’s switchyard and the main electrical transformer of reactor unit 4., Unit 4 is instead receiving the electricity it needs for cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions from a back-up line connecting the ZNPP to the switchyard of the nearby thermal power plant, Director General Grossi said, referring to information provided by the team of IAEA experts present at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant., In a further sign of the precarious situation in the area of the ZNPP, the IAEA team said there had been shelling in the vicinity of the plant in recent days, following a period of reduced military activity. Yesterday, shelling near the thermal power plant switchyard temporarily disconnected one of the ZNPP’s three back-up power lines through which the town of Enerhodar has been receiving electricity. This 150 kV power line was re-connected later the same day., “Operating staff at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant are working hard in very challenging circumstances to prevent the kind of repeated power outages we saw in early October,” Director General Grossi said. “While their determined efforts have had some positive results, the plant’s power situation remains extremely vulnerable.”, Director General Grossi has engaged in high-level talks with both Ukraine and Russia in recent weeks aimed at agreeing and implementing a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP as soon as possible., Of the ZNPP’s six reactors, Unit 5 is in hot shutdown to produce steam needed for the plant’s operations and Unit 6 is now also being heated up for the same purpose. The four other units remain in cold shutdown., Director General Grossi also today expressed his continued grave concern about the increasingly difficult and stressful working conditions for the plant’s Ukrainian operating personnel, who are being requested by Russia to sign new employment contracts with an entity it has set up, replacing their current contracts with the Ukrainian national operator, Energoatom. Russia has announced it has taken control of the ZNPP following the creation of a Russian state operating organization for the site., Director General Grossi, who has repeatedly stated that the plant is Ukrainian, warned that the situation could affect both the availability of key personnel and operational decision-making, with a potentially negative impact on nuclear safety and security, increasing the risk of a nuclear accident at the ZNPP., The IAEA team at the ZNPP has been informed about the recent release of one of two Ukrainian plant personnel who were detained some two weeks ago. He is reportedly in good health. Director General Grossi welcomed the news of the release and made an appeal for the other staff member to be released soon., Also today, Director General Grossi said IAEA inspectors had begun – and would soon complete – verification activities at two locations in Ukraine, following a written request from the Ukraine government to send teams of inspectors there., Ukraine’s request was issued after the Russian Federation made allegations about activities related to the possible production of “dirty bombs” at the two locations, which are under IAEA safeguards and have been visited regularly by IAEA inspectors. The purpose of the safeguards visits is to detect any possible undeclared nuclear activities and materials related to the development of “dirty bombs”. The IAEA inspected one of the two locations a month ago and no undeclared nuclear activities or materials were found there., Director General Grossi said he would later this week provide his initial conclusions about the latest verification activities at the two sites.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-122-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-31-oct-2022

Winter Aid Action Plan: Switzerland helps Ukraine through the winter,News and Press Release,Govt. Switzerland,"Contributions
Shelter and Non-Food Items",2 Nov 2022,"Bern, 02.11.2022 - At its meeting on 2 November 2022, the Federal Council adopted an action plan to mitigate the impact of the coming winter on the people of Ukraine. Switzerland is providing CHF 100 million in aid, in particular for projects financing the urgent rehabilitation of Ukraine's energy infrastructure. The humanitarian situation of those affected by the war in Ukraine has become even more precarious in recent weeks due to targeted attacks on energy infrastructure and basic supply systems., Around 18 million people in Ukraine – some 40 per cent of the population – are dependent on aid due to the war. With the onset of winter, this number may rise to 24 million. Over 30 per cent of Ukraine's energy infrastructure has been damaged. The targeted attacks have left many places without access to drinking water, as well as disrupting power and telecommunications. Ukraine requires additional aid from the international community to deal with this emergency., The impending winter will bring further problems for those affected by the war. President of the Confederation Ignazio Cassis and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy discussed ways to tackle this problem at their meeting on 20 October 2022. The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) of the FDFA and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) of the EAER were also represented at the talks in Kyiv., At its meeting on 2 November 2022, the Federal Council adopted the Winter Aid Action Plan to support the people of Ukraine. In addition to its existing humanitarian undertaking in Ukraine and the region, it is making CHF 100 million available for projects to support the urgent rehabilitation of energy infrastructure and alleviate the precarious humanitarian situation. For example, Switzerland is helping Ukrainian energy companies purchase energy sources and spare parts, contributing to the repair of rail fastening systems (for the transport of heavy goods such as grain) and providing humanitarian support to help those worst affected by the war in Ukraine to prepare for winter (replacing windows, providing insulation and food, etc.). Efforts are also under way to determine if Switzerland can supply further relief goods such as generators, pumps or water treatment installations., The Federal Council will submit a request to Parliament for a supplementary credit of CHF 76 million to cover these lines of action., Address for enquiries, For further information:

"Ukraine Humanitarian Fund: 2022 Allocations Dashboard, January - September 2022",Infographic,OCHA,Contributions,2 Nov 2022,"Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund (UHF) has been a critical source of funding to enable aid organizations to quickly scale up their operations and support millions of people whose lives have been devastated by the war. With four Reserve Allocations so far in 2022, the UHF has disbursed over US$117 million, which allowed 40 humanitarian partners to target an estimated 5 million people with life-saving assistance – 60 per cent of them women and girls., In February, the UHF launched a Reserve Allocation of $41.4 million, only three days after the start of the war.
The funding was essential to enable a timely response in the first days of the invasion and complemented the $3.3 million disbursed in January through the first Reserve Allocation to kick-start the implementation of aid activities in the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan. As the hostilities and fighting intensifying, increasing humanitarian needs, the UHF launched a third Reserve Allocation of $46.5 million in April. Part of the funding went direct to organizations working to prevent gender-based violence and support survivors, in addition to other life-saving activities, including evacuations of civilians, protection services, and in-kind and cash assistance to internally displaced people and other groups impacted by the war., In July, with the launch of the 2022–23 Winter Priority Procurement and Repair Plan, which required $226 million, the UHF allocated $25.7 million through the fourth Reserve Allocation to support time-critical procurement of heating equipment and repairs of war-damaged homes. The activities were timed to start in advance of the cold season to help people having dignified and warm places during the winter months. The First Standard Allocation is also underway for an additional $70 million to further support the most vulnerable people., The very large increase in the amount allocated by the UHF in 2022 – the Fund had allocated just above $20 million between 2019 and 2021 – has been made possible thanks to donors' generous and timely support.
So far in 2022, the UHF has received nearly $205 million from 26 donors and private contributions, and a further $20 million in pledges, making it the world’s largest OCHA-managed country-based pooled fund.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-fund-2022-allocations-dashboard-january-september-2022

Shelter and Non-Food Items
Water Sanitation Hygiene",2 Nov 2022,"The recurrent attacks against essential civilian infrastructure in the context of the Russia-Ukraine international armed conflict are disrupting access to key services, causing major civilian suffering, especially as temperatures have started to drop significantly., Hostilities have had an outsized effect on essential infrastructure, including power and water supply systems which have sustained heavy damage in recent weeks., The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been taking urgent action in coordination with local authorities in areas affected by the fighting to repair damaged infrastructure and provide materials for people to make essential home repairs. But the needs are massive., “As winter closes in, people are going to struggle to meet their basic needs like having clean drinking water and staying warm. Targeting civilian infrastructure puts civilian lives in peril and is prohibited by international humanitarian law,” said Guislain Defurne, ICRC’s head of operations in Ukraine. “Our teams will continue to support affected communities and local authorities with whom we’ve been working closely for years.”, In addition to its work to repair key infrastructure, the ICRC – in partnership with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and in coordination with the authorities - also provided more than 63 million Swiss francs in financial support to over 330,000 particularly vulnerable people living in areas directly affected by hostilities., People living in those areas are sharing major concerns as power cuts and frigid temperatures become the norm, a particularly perilous situation for vulnerable civilians like the elderly, the injured, children and people with disabilities., “I am very worried about those who have been left homeless. A friend’s house was heavily damaged. Doors and windows were smashed, as were the roof and the ceiling. Winter is around the corner and there is no gas, no light, no water. You can imagine what it’s like,” said Tetiana, a resident of Shevchenkove, a small town in the Kharkiv region in the north of Ukraine., The ICRC has been working on electricity and water rehabilitation projects since 2014 and has scaled up its activities for the people affected by the international armed conflict over the past eight months, including support to 27 water boards in major urban areas like Kyiv, Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk., Rehabilitation of essential infrastructure and support to civilians are key components of ICRC’s work. Here are some of the key areas of work since February:, Provided support to heating systems impacting Borodyinka, Chernihiv, Irpin, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv which helps nearly 1.1 million people stay warm as temperatures drop., Gave 7 generators to the Sumy water board, 2 generators to Kharkiv heating company and 3 generators to Mykolaiv heating company to help keep these systems working. Additionally, 10 power transformers were provided to Mykolaiv power supply company., Distributed emergency water in Donetsk to educational facilities and more than 23 health facilities, and supported Voda Donbasa to sustainably reestablish water provision for the wider population through the donation of equipment and vehicles., Delivering construction materials to support rehabilitation of up to 1,000 houses in the areas of Kharkiv oblast such as Izyum, Kupiansk, Malinivka and others., Provided financial support to replace 14 km of pipes in less than 3 weeks in Irpin, benefiting 210,000 people., Supported the rehabilitation of damaged homes and civilian infrastructure, with construction materials donated to Mykolaiv and Odesa, and building materials provided to families in Tsyrkuny., Distributed emergency construction materials to 5,500 households for temporary rehabilitation of roofs damaged by shelling in the Donetsk region., Provided drinking water in Mykolaiv with the Ukrainian Red Cross., Provided nearly 63 million Swiss francs in financial support to over 330,000 people to meet the needs of their household., For more information:, Jennifer Sparks, ICRC Geneva (English), +41792173200

Ukraine Reconstruction: Commissioner Simson visits the country to boost the support for Ukraine's energy system,News and Press Release,EC,Recovery and Reconstruction,1 Nov 2022,"Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson visited Ukraine on 1 November to discuss with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Minister of Energy German Galushchenko and international partners the immediate concrete support for its battered energy sector. Russia's persistent and deliberate targeting of Ukrainian energy infrastructure over the past weeks and months has affected more than 30% of the country's energy system., The EU has, together with the Member States and private companies, delivered millions of euros worth of emergency energy equipment to Ukraine, but the level of support needs to be ramped up in light of Russia's escalating attacks. In addition to the necessary equipment, €25.5 million has been made available to cover the most urgent needs via the Ukraine Energy Support Fund that the Commission has set up with the Energy Community. A dedicated campaign to mobilise further support from the private sector will be launched in the coming days jointly by the Commission, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine and the Energy Community., This visit comes just ahead of the winter season and less than a week after the European Commission and the G7 Presidency called for an international ‘Marshall plan for Ukraine', which would pave the way for the country's immediate and sustainable reconstruction., In Kyiv, Commissioner Simson met President Zelenskyy, to discuss the latest developments and how the EU can lead the international effort to repair and rebuild the Ukrainian energy infrastructure. She also participated in the first meeting of the International Energy Advisory Council for Ukraine (IEAC4U), a new forum announced by Minister Galushchenko at the EU energy ministers' meeting in Prague in mid-October. The IEAC4U will help coordinate the efforts of all participating countries and will provide technical assistance in matching Ukrainian needs with potential donations., The visit was also an opportunity for Commissioner Simson to co-chair the EU-Ukraine High-Level Energy Dialogue together with the Minister of Energy, where the immediate needs of the Ukrainian energy system and the security of supply situation, as well as the reconstruction and decarbonisation of its energy system were discussed. At the meeting, the Commissioner announced that 13 million euros have been allocated for the restoration of laboratories damaged by the Russian occupiers at the nuclear site of Chornobyl and that the EU intends to channel through the International Atomic Energy Agency a further €3.5 million as support for Ukraine in this sector., The Commissioner also met with the members of the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, and had discussions with Ukrenergo and other Ukrainian energy companies., Background, Since the outbreak of Russia's unjustified war, the EU has been supporting the Ukrainian energy sector via different channels and means. With ENTSO-E, it has enabled the emergency synchronisation of the Ukrainian and Moldovan electricity grids with the Continental one to ensure stability of the electricity system. To tackle the most immediate needs of reparation, the Commission has promoted the establishment of the Ukraine Energy Support Fund with the Energy Community Secretariat., Under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, the Commission has facilitated numerous shipments of vital energy equipment, from generators to transformers and cables, through its Emergency Response Coordination Centre. In addition, more than 40 million euros worth chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threat countermeasures and equipment have been delivered from the EU reserves. The Commission has also supported with €7.7 million the State Scientific Technical Centre for Nuclear and Radiation Safety of Ukraine., For more information, EU Solidarity with Ukraine, Statement by President von der Leyen at the joint press conference with Chancellor Scholz and Prime Minister Shmyhal of Ukraine on the occasion of the International Expert Conference on the Reconstruction of Ukraine, Speech by Simson at the press point in Kyiv, Ukraine (europa.eu), Press contact, Balazs UJVARI Phone +32 2 295 45 78 Mail balazs.ujvari@ec.europa.eu Tim McPHIE Phone",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-reconstruction-commissioner-simson-visits-country-boost-support-ukraines-energy-system

UNICEF delivers 2.3 million COVID-19 vaccines to Ukraine with U.S. support [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNICEF,"Contributions
Health",28 Oct 2022,"The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has delivered 2.3 million doses of the mRNA Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine to Ukraine, with the support of the U.S. Government through USAID and as part of the COVAX initiative., The vaccines are produced by Pfizer-BioNTech, and soon will be distributed to 23 regions of Ukraine., ""We thank all our partners for the constant support provided to Ukraine and the provision of vaccines aimed to protect Ukrainians from COVID-19,” said Minister of Health in Ukraine Viktor Lyashko. “While the resources of health care systems are concentrating on the treatment of our defenders at the frontline, we kindly ask all Ukrainians to get vaccinated against COVID-19, so that they do not suffer from its complications., Please, keep strong and healthy, as it's a part of our inevitable victory.”, “This shipment of 2.3 million Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines - our largest donation to Ukraine so far - is one way the U.S. is helping to protect the health of Ukrainians as we head into winter. That brings the total to 6.4 million doses provided since the start of the pandemic. This latest delivery is just one example of the American people’s steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine and the Ukrainian people amid Russia’s brutal war. Let me add that I am just so proud of what members of the USAID team have accomplished since February, helping meet the urgent humanitarian needs of this country’s citizens. Looking toward the future, they are also partnering with Ukraine to improve the health system and build stronger public institutions, which will benefit Ukrainian society for generations to come.” - Christopher W. Smith, U.S. Chargé d’Affaires in Ukraine., ""UNICEF continues supporting the healthcare systems of Ukraine, including through the delivery of vaccines against dangerous infections,” said UNICEF Ukraine Representative Murat Sahin. “It is especially important now, during the war, that as many people as possible are protected from COVID-19. If you have not been vaccinated yet, please do so. And do not forget about the booster dose to strengthen protection, especially if you belong to an at-risk group.”, ”WHO continues to support Ukrainian health system with COVID-19 immunization in various technical areas during the war, including strategic guidance, country-wide capacity-building program for healthcare workers, and direct operational assistance to outreach vaccination activities among high-risk and vulnerable population. This new delivery of vaccines against COVID-19, thanks to the joint COVAX initiative, is ensuring a continuous course of protection against the coronavirus for Ukrainians. It is worth to remind that the elderly and those with chronic diseases are most vulnerable and should be fully vaccinated, including with booster shots as appropriate. Vaccines are available at healthcare facilities and are free for administration”, - Guillaume Simonian, acting WHO Representative in Ukraine., Vaccines can be used for the first and booster dose., All people over the age of 18 can receive the second booster dose (the fourth vaccination against COVID-19) in Ukraine. The booster is especially recommended for people at higher risk from COVID-19, including elderly people, people with cancer, cardiovascular diseases, bronchial asthma and diabetes. Immunocompromised people are eligible for up to 5 doses of COVID-19 vaccines., The COVAX initiative works to guarantee fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for every country in the world. COVAX is co-led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).

30 OCTOBER 2022, The following statement was issued today by the Spokesman for UN Secretary-General António Guterres:, The Secretary-General is deeply concerned about the ongoing situation regarding the Black Sea Grain Initiative., He has decided to delay his departure for the Arab League Summit in Algiers by a day to focus on the issue., The Secretary-General continues to engage in intense contacts aiming at the end of the Russian suspension of its participation in the Black Sea Grain Initiative. The same engagement also aims at the renewal and full implementation of the initiative to facilitate exports of food and fertilizer from Ukraine, as well as removing the remaining obstacles to the exports of Russian food and fertilizer.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/secretary-general-concerned-over-situation-regarding-black-sea-grain-initiative
Remarks to the Security Council by Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths [As delivered] 31 October 2022,News and Press Release,OCHA,"Food and Nutrition
Logistics and Telecommunications",31 Oct 2022,"Thank you very much, Mr. President, thank you for this opportunity., Thirty-eight countries have purchased some nine million tons of grain from Ukraine under the Black Sea Grain Initiative. As has been noted, not all of it has gone to the neediest countries., But all of it has a humanitarian impact: the reduction of prices, the calming of market volatility. Ukraine’s grain exports are not a food aid operation, but they do operate as a huge lever on price, with positive ripple effects throughout the world. New security allegations are a cause of grave concern to the Secretary-General and many Member States are worried now the deal is in trouble., So it’s a privilege for me, Mr. President, to brief the Council on this particular matter today., Over the weekend, the Secretary-General heard from our Russian colleagues of their intent to suspend participation in the Black Sea Grain Initiative, the reasons for which I am sure they will share with us today., Mr. President,, It would indeed be a grave abuse of the Black Sea Grain Initiative if it were used in any way for military operational advantage., The United Nations has the solemn privilege of assisting the Parties to implement this unique arrangement. Acting as a Secretariat, the UN is ready to investigate, along with Member States party to the Initiative, any and all evidence, if requested., The Joint Coordination Centre – comprised of representatives of all four signatories to the Initiative – has established and agreed processes for such incidents and accidents., When a ship’s captain reported seeing a possible floating mine recently, the JCC, the Joint Coordination Centre, agreed by consensus to pause shipping, and it allowed a Ukrainian tugboat, accompanied by a search-and-rescue vessel at a distance, to search the area. Nothing was found, and the JCC decided to resume shipping the next day, and I cite this as an example of the JCC’s functioning., This, of course, is why Russia’s suspension is concerning: There is a painstaking process, in the JCC, to arrive at a consensus on matters large and small, even when a hot war is raging. The JCC has to be, and is, meticulously impartial., The corridor has been tranquil. The ships sailed, the food did flow, prices did drop. And we must all hope that this [hope] will rise again., I wish to stress three points related to the alleged connection to the Initiative of the Sevastopol attacks and the damage to Russian military vessels and infrastructure., Firstly, to be clear, no military vessels, aircraft or assets are, or have been, involved in support of the Initiative by any party. They are not required. In fact, they are prohibited from going closer than ten nautical miles to the cargo ships, according to procedures agreed by all the parties., Secondly, the corridor itself is just lines on a chart: When Initiative vessels, vessels involved in the Black Sea Grain Initiative, are not in the area, the corridor has no special status. It provides neither cover nor protection for offensive or defensive military action. It’s not a shield, it’s not a hideout, it’s not a no-go zone. These things come into play when a ship passes through those lines on the sea., Third, coming to alleged misuse of cargo vessels in the Initiative for military purposes, none were in the corridor on the night of 29 October when the reported attacks took place. No vessel reported an incident over the weekend. So we are ready to consider and inquire into any evidence that is reported to us in the JCC., All sides decided in the JCC that this Initiative should be entirely civilian in nature. Rather than escorts, as was imagined by some, or patrols, the safety of shipping is protected by the commitments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation. Both commit not to attack ships and related port facilities, under paragraph C of the agreement signed on 22 July in Istanbul., We stand ready to discuss any concerns, therefore, in terms of the Initiative and its implementation. We continue to rely on the key contribution of Türkiye as a mediator, facilitator and host., Mr President,, The JCC’s operations are an open book, or, I should perhaps say, an open database: The journeys of cargo vessels in the Initiative can be tracked in real time on public websites. All parties share the same information about ships, cargo, inspection and destinations. The data for 9.5 million tons of shipments on the UN website, that’s the export to date, has been accessed over 70,000 times., The rigorous joint inspections, including, of course, by Russian inspectors, as well as all of the parties to the Initiative, have combed through the storage holds, engine rooms and tanks of ships over 800 times. The searches have come up with plenty of minor inconsistencies: missing paperwork, some sacks of rice swept from a previous cargo shipment, a crew member’s passport recorded wrongly. More seriously, the JCC teams have battled to maintain a balance between safety and rigor when inspecting cargo that has been fumigated with toxic insecticide. The JCC has recorded some 60 navigational deviations from the agreed corridors in over 820 voyages facilitated by the Initiative., On over 100 occasions when problems were raised, the JCC process is comprehensive and exhaustive. Corrective measures have been agreed by consensus. It’s not the easiest format for countries at war to work. But, Mr. President, up to now, it has worked, to their great credit., However, Mr. President, in the days leading up to Russia’s suspension of its participation, it is true that the process had been getting bogged down, due to insufficient inspection capacity. Food for millions was stuck in a maritime traffic jam in the Bosphorus, visible from above. Ships’ captains are calling in, desperate to get moved up through the queue., And that meant we lost time, the shipping industry lost money, and we are delaying food delivery, and we need to get back to the status quo ante when we were able to export those millions of tons., Let me conclude by observing, Mr. President, that some have questioned the value of this quite extraordinary effort. They have said it’s not enough, that the food is going to the wrong places, and it’s the wrong type of food., Mark my words, when things go awry, as now, we can see together can see how much good it can do and has been doing., We insist, as we have all along, that the exports from both of these global breadbaskets, Ukraine and Russia, are vital. We need unimpeded exports from both. Of course, Rebeca [Grynspan, Secretary-General of the UN Conference on Trade and Development] will brief you in more detail, but let me also say very clearly that we hope and expect all Member States to work to support the implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding between the United Nations and the Russian Federation, also signed on 22 July, to ensure their own food and fertilizer exports can expeditiously reach global markets., Because if we can’t get more fertilizer out, we face even worse shortages next year. And I, as the Emergency Relief Coordinator, for me, the thought of even more global hunger next year – that’s the nightmare that we face., I particularly welcome pledges from both countries, Russia and Ukraine, to donate food to support humanitarian relief operations in the world’s hardest-hit and hungry nations. It’s a heartening sign that both sides recognise the special responsibilities that they share., As I’m sure Rebeca will explore and explain much better than I, when the Chicago Board of Trade opened today, wheat prices jumped. Wheat prices jumped as a result of recent events, and each fraction of a percentage point increase pushes someone, somewhere, over the line into extreme poverty. Insurers tell us their premiums may leap by a quarter or a half for shipping across the Black Sea., We are very encouraged by Russia’s assurance, and this is an important, not merely a distinction, it’s an important fact, that it is not pulling out of the Initiative, as has been said by some. It is only temporarily suspending activities in the implementation of the Initiative. The Russian Federation has deployed a highly professional team at the JCC for its implementation and they are still there. We look forward to welcoming them back as a full and active participant as soon as may be in the fulfilment of the goals that we have all agreed and signed up to. The United Nations is ready to address concerns and listen to suggestions from all sides, we’ve had many discussions, as we approach the 120-day extension point on November 19th, where the Initiative can be renewed., Today, emergency measures were taken to release some of the cargo from Ukrainian ports and to inspect some of 100 or so vessels that are queued up and ready to go. We need to continue fulfilling our commitments and act in concert as before. Our understanding is that the Initiative and commitments remain in force, even during the suspension of Russia’s participation., Today, 12 ships sailed out from Ukrainian ports and two headed in to load food. All of these ships were previously inspected by the full membership of the Joint Coordination Centre., One headed south through the corridor, as an example, is the IKARIA ANGEL, with 30,000 tons of World Food Programme wheat for Ethiopia. Another passed inspection on its onward journey, the PANGEO, full with wheat destined for Yemen and Afghanistan. The next WFP vessel is on its way., So, Mr. President, I have a simple message: Let us keep this supply line open. Let us keep this Initiative in action. Let us resolve our differences with all speed. This initiative is too important to fail., Thank you very much.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/remarks-security-council-under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-relief-coordinator-martin-griffiths-delivered-31-october-2022
MCC partners in Ukraine adjust work because of increased Russian military attacks,News and Press Release,MCC,"Food and Nutrition

Water Sanitation Hygiene",31 Oct 2022,"Oct. 31, 2022, Providing relief and care to victims of war while living in a war zone is never an easy task. And for MCC partners still working in Ukraine, the decision of whether to pause their work or continue it is a day-to-day question without a clear answer., Since the beginning of October, Russian military forces have renewed long-range bombing of cities across Ukraine. One of the targets of these strikes is the city of Zaporizhzhia, where MCC’s Ukraine office and many of its partners are based. These attacks have caused some partners to temporarily suspend parts of their emergency response., Max*, the program director for New Hope Center, which operates in Zaporizhzhia, says the indiscriminate nature of the attacks has required them to put a hold on their transitional shelter and trauma counselling work., “We decided to pause almost everything we're doing in Zaporizhzhia and wait a couple of weeks to see where all this is going,” he says. “And that's very unfortunate because the need is huge. And the ministry team here is eager to work and help with the needs. But we decided that it's better to wait … it's okay to wait two weeks just to keep the team safe.”, Keeping the team and any relief recipients safe has been a significant challenge these last few weeks. Missiles and drones are regularly launched between 2 and 6 a.m., keeping even a good night’s rest unavailable for the citizens of Zaporizhzhia., “One of the missiles hit an apartment building less than 300 metres from our church at night,” says Max. “And it looks very different now. There were people who got killed, got injured. That's one of the reasons we decided not to meet as a church two Sundays ago.”, Blaine Derstine, interim representative for MCC in Ukraine, says that while many of MCC’s partners are in a similar position to Max, some have found ways to adapt their programs., “New Life Charitable Foundation is in Nikopol, where they’ve been under attack for weeks now,” says Derstine. “Some of the staff relocated to Dnipro where there were fewer missile strikes. A new office was opened and they're distributing food there now. And in other parts of Ukraine, our partners continue to adapt to the conditions of the conflict as the needs around them persist.”, Nearly 8 million Ukrainians have fled the country for refuge since February 2022 and 6.2 million are internally displaced within the country. Many no longer have homes to return to., Derstine says that MCC is working on a combination of short- and longer-term plans for its Ukraine response and that both approaches are essential., “People have immense needs right now — food, water, shelter — which we’re working to address,” he says. “And even with the unclear picture of the future in Ukraine, we also have to be thinking for the long-term, what needs people will have if and when they start returning to Ukraine.”, Mennonite Central Committee: Relief, development and peace in the name of Christ, -END-",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/mcc-partners-ukraine-adjust-work-because-increased-russian-military-attacks

The lack of water is particularly critical now during the harsh cold season, as it is necessary to run the heating systems in most of Ukraine’s homes.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-escalation-attacks-across-country-flash-update-no5-31-oct-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",28 Oct 2022,"After eight years of armed conflict in the east of the country, the Russian Federation started a military offensive in Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The impact of this war has been devastating. It has so far caused 16,200 civilian casualties and destroyed key infrastructure, such as hospitals, schools, homes, and water installations., Since the beginning of the conflict, nearly 14 million people - a third of all Ukrainians - have been forced to leave their homes, 90% of them women, children, and elderly people. An estimated 6.2 million people are displaced within Ukraine, while more than 7 million sought safety in Poland, Romania and Moldova or passed through to other destinations in Europe. Some have returned to Ukraine. Another 13 million people are estimated to be stranded in or unable to leave affected areas within the country., Our concerns for the most vulnerable, Many people who have fled their homes are traumatized by war, separation, and travel. They are more vulnerable to violence and intimidation. They may face difficulties in finding transport, food, legal advice, and accommodation. They may face language barriers and accessing the right documentation to register themselves, and may even be confronted with pushbacks. As always in a crisis, those who are already marginalised or vulnerable are hardest hit., As a humanitarian organization, Oxfam is gravely concerned about the impacts of the crisis on those most at risk among those who have fled and those who remain within Ukraine. A large majority are women, children (many unaccompanied), elderly people and people living with disabilities or chronic illnesses. Without the protections of their usual homes, sources of livelihood, family and community, they are at a greater risk of trafficking, extortion and gender-based violence. They can lack access to adequate health and psychosocial care., We are also concerned about the unequal treatment and lack of adequate protection of refugees from certain minority groups such as Roma, LGBTQI+ individuals and people from third countries outside the EU, who often face discrimination and find it more difficult to access lifesaving assistance like shelter, food and healthcare., Oxfam’s humanitarian response: partnering with local civil society organizations, Oxfam is responding to this humanitarian crisis by primarily working with local civil society organizations who are already supporting displaced people and the communities that host them. Both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries we have provided funding and technical assistance to 23 organizations. Our partnership model allows Oxfam to get its resources most quickly to local communities via established grassroots organizations who are nearer to those people who most need our help., Our partners have been able to expand their operations to deliver emergency life-saving assistance and protection across different areas: water and sanitation, shelter, food, cash distribution, legal assistance, information and counselling (particularly on the risks of human trafficking and gender-based violence), mental health and psychological support, social cohesion activities, as well as offer a variety of other vital services, such as language classes or job search support., We are grateful to the incredible generosity shown by our supporters, across Europe and beyond. It has enabled us to help 610,228 people from March to August 2022 with vital humanitarian assistance across Ukraine, Poland, Romania and Moldova.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/six-months-after-russian-invasion-oxfams-humanitarian-response-war-ukraine

Food and Nutrition",28 Oct 2022,"SG/SM/21556, The following statement was issued today by the Spokesman for UN Secretary-General António Guterres:, The Secretary-General expresses his unwavering commitment and strong support to the renewal and full implementation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, as well as for the full implementation of the agreement signed with the Russian Federation. Both agreements aim to ensure that grain and fertilizers from Ukraine and the Russian Federation reach global markets at the speed and price needed to avert a global food crisis and ensure food security. The United Nations continues its active and constant engagement with all parties towards that goal., We underline the urgency of doing so to contribute to food security across the world, and to cushion the suffering that this global cost-of-living crisis is inflicting on billions of people. If food and fertilizers do not reach global markets now, farmers will not have fertilizers at the right time and at a price they can afford as the planting season begins, endangering crops in all regions of the world in 2023 and 2024, with dramatic effect on food production and food prices worldwide. The current crisis of affordability will turn into a crisis of availability., The impact of the agreement signed in Istanbul has been clearly demonstrated. Exports of grains and other food products under the Black Sea Grain Initiative have surpassed 9 million tons, with the close monitoring and coordination of the Joint Coordination Centre, comprising representatives from the Russian Federation, Türkiye, Ukraine and the United Nations under the terms of the agreement. This would not have been made possible without the hard work of all representatives at the Joint Coordination Centre. We express our gratitude to Türkiye for hosting the Joint Coordination Centre and supporting actively its operations., The resumption of exports has significantly contributed to lower prices of wheat and other commodities. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Food Index has declined for 7 months in a row. According to our estimates based on the World Bank model, the reduction of prices for staple foods has indirectly prevented some 100 million people from falling into extreme poverty., The initial duration of the agreement to facilitate grains and fertilizer exports from Ukraine is 120 days and can be extended automatically on 19 November if no party objects. We urge all parties to make every effort to renew the Black Sea Grain Initiative and implement both agreements to their fullest, including the expedited removal of any remaining impediments to Russian grain and fertilizer export., The United Nations is fully committed to continuing to work with all parties to ensure that we reach this goal. We do not underestimate the challenges, but we know they can be overcome., Governments, shipping companies, grain and fertilizer traders and farmers all over the world are now looking for clarity on the future., For information media.

On 17 October, one week after the intensification of missile attack in Kyiv and other cities, attacks on energy infrastructure cut off electricity for many residents and caused civilian casualties. Similar attacks across the country subjected most regions and millions of Ukrainians to disruptions in power and water supplies with at least one-third of the country’s energy infrastructure damaged, according to the Government estimates. Later on 22 October, another wave of attacks targeted energy facilities, including in the western Khmelnytska, Rivnenska and Volynska oblasts as well as central Kirovohradska oblast. Throughout the reporting period, and for weeks prior, the cities of Zaporizhzhia in Zaporizka oblast and Mykolaiv in the southern Mykolaivska oblast have been hit with daily airstrikes and shelling. Meanwhile, Bakhmut, in the eastern Donetska oblast has also come under increasingly regular fire. Officials have appealed to Ukrainians to conserve energy and have scheduled temporary power outages., Access, On 19 October, the Russian Federation declared “Martial law” in the parts of the four Ukrainian oblasts it recently claimed to have annexed – Donetska, Khersonska, Luhanska and Zaporizka – creating concerns that it would become more difficult for civilians to move in and out of these oblasts, and for humanitarian organizations to access people in need. The humanitarian community continued efforts to reach people in need in areas recently retaken by the Ukrainian Government in the eastern Kharkivska and southern Khersonska oblasts, including through humanitarian-aid convoys. Over the last two weeks, the Government of Ukraine reported it had regained control of 90 settlements in Khersonska oblast. Humanitarian organizations also geared up efforts to help Ukrainians in these areas prepare for the coming winter., Civilian casualties, Civilians have continued to pay a high price from fighting, airstrikes and shelling. Most of the dozens of new civilian casualties reported over the past two weeks occurred in Donetska oblast, followed by Dnipropetrovska, Kharkivska and Zaporizka oblasts. Since the full-scale war began in February and as of 23 October, verified civilian casualties in Ukraine have reached at least 16,150, according to the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU). Over 6,370 civilians were killed and nearly 9,780 injured in the past eight months. Some 61 per cent of all civilian casualties have occurred in Donetska and Luhanska oblasts – where 3,788 people have been killed and 5,111 injured. HRMMU stresses that it believes the actual figures are much higher. Civilian casualties also involved energy-industry personnel injured during shelling – reportedly including at the Kurakhove Thermal Power Plant in Donetska oblast on 18 October – and as the result of landmine explosions, reportedly especially in the newly retaken areas of Kharkivska oblast.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-26-oct-2022-enukru

The speed and scale of the crisis makes it the biggest and fastest displacement of people in Europe since World War II, with a third of the entire Ukrainian population finding themselves displaced internally or externally., Europe has emerged as a safe haven for Ukrainian families and the swift activation of the Temporary Protection Directive enabled EU countries to provide uniform protection to around 4.6 million displaced people in Europe, while averting the collapse of the Common European Asylum System., The report is based on almost 4 000 responses from those displaced by the invasion, 71% of whom had completed University education. Unsurprisingly, the large majority of respondents (82%) were women. Seventy-three percent indicated having reached their preferred destination in Europe and noted that the main reasons for choosing their destination country were work opportunities (50%) or reuniting with friends and family members (47%). The OECD notes that based on these trends and other data, the European labour force is expected to expand by 0.5% in 2022., The conflict has not only displaced millions of Ukrainians, but also a few hundred thousand other nationalities who were residents in Ukraine, including Turkish, Russian, Indian, Azerbaijani as well as Israeli and Georgian nationals.

While the region also hosts the largest number of internally displaced persons, there has also been a steady inflow to Kyiv where the security situation is perceived as better., Over six million of all forcibly displaced persons internally or externally had chosen to return home in August, more than doubling since May 2022 (2.7 million).

He also pointed out that the Organization currently has neither the mandate nor the technical or operational capacity to investigate this., Recalling that the provisions of article VI of the Convention have never been invoked, he underlined that the article does not provide any guidance on the type of investigation that the Council may initiate. While highlighting that States Parties have also not developed any specific guidance or procedures concerning the modalities, he added that the Office for Disarmament Affairs stands ready to support should the Council initiate an investigation., The representative of the Russian Federation stated that its longstanding concerns pertain to military and biological activities carried out by the United States Department of Defense in facilities in Ukraine close to his country’s border, adding that documents unearthed during its special operation in Ukraine revealed the true nature of the Pentagon’s activities. He stated that the Pentagon had funded 30 Ukrainian laboratories by 2020, and that a facility in Odessa had collected pathogens of dangerous infectious disease, with the possibility of spreading through birds, bats and mosquitoes., China’s delegate, echoing that point, stated that the information on biological military activities provided by the Russian Federation “deserves a corresponding response” by relevant parties, who should fulfil their obligations under the Convention. Regretting that the formal consultative meeting held under article V of the Convention in September had failed to answer the questions raised by Moscow, he proposed that the international community consider invoking article VI to facilitate the establishment of a verification mechanism to ensure the Convention’s authority and effectiveness., The representative of the United States reiterated that her country does not have a biological weapons programme nor does it support any Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories. Responding to the Russian Federation’s delegate, she said that “much like Russia, birds and bats don’t tend to observe or respect sovereign borders”. It is Moscow that has maintained a biological weapons programme, with a well-documented history of using chemical weapons and siding with the Syrian regime on its use, she said., Ukraine’s delegate, reiterating that her country has never developed, produced or stored biological or chemical weapons, pointed out that the majority of States parties at the formal consultative meeting in September had found the presentations by her country and the United States to be accurate and persuasive, while all allegations by the Russian Federation were rejected. While Kyiv has requested numerous times for Moscow to provide the information on the location and status of the biomaterials from public health laboratories in occupied parts of Ukraine, she highlighted that no answer has been received., Albania’s representative, noting that today’s meeting could have been called “Security Council briefing on nothing,” said that the only way to verify Moscow’s claims is to use the mechanisms and established procedures that are already in place. Expressing concern over the dissemination of false information that fails to meet scientific parameters, he said that the documents presented by the Russian Federation presented no tangible evidence of violations of the Convention., Ireland’s representative, expressing concern over Moscow’s lodging of a complaint with the Council under article VI of the Biological Weapons Convention, said that further investigation in this regard is neither warranted nor useful. He went on to state that its actions risk undermining essential multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation instruments and constitute an attack on legitimate cooperation and research supporting public health in Ukraine and in other countries around the world., Mexico’s delegate, recalling that the prerequisite for the Council to consider an investigation is credible evidence, underscored that since the Office for Disarmament Affairs has found no evidence, the issue should be brought to the attention at the ninth Review Conference of the Convention which is due to take place in November., Ghana’s representative underscored the need to establish an implementation body for the Convention as a means of encouraging compliance and transparency. Imploring both parties to adhere to the international humanitarian law and the Convention, she added: “The use of biological agents and toxins and other weapons of mass destruction as instruments of war is ruthlessly inhumane, can never be confined to national borders, will leave no winners and should, therefore, not be even contemplated.”, Also speaking today were representatives of Norway, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Kenya, France, Brazil, India and Gabon., The Council meeting began at 3:04 p.m. and ended at 4:25 p.m., Briefing, ADEDEJI EBO, Director and Deputy to the High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, noting that the Russian Federation has filed an official complaint in line with the provisions of article VI of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction (Biological Weapons Convention) regarding allegations of biological weapons programmes in Ukraine, said that the United Nations is not aware of any such programmes. He added that the Organization currently has neither the mandate nor the technical or operational capacity to investigate this information. Recalling that the relevant instrument of international law is the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, he noted that both the Russian Federation and Ukraine are States parties to the Convention., He recalled that on 29 June, the Russian Federation submitted a request for the convening of a formal consultative meeting under article V of the Convention as well as the Final Declarations of the Convention’s Second and Third Review Conferences. Following an informal meeting, the formal consultative meeting opened on 26 August for a brief procedural meeting, then resumed on 5 September for a period of four days. While States welcomed that the Russian Federation, Ukraine and the United States sought to clarify their positions, the meeting concluded with States parties adopting a report which stated that no consensus was reaching regarding the meeting’s outcome., Turning to article VI, he said that its provisions have not been invoked since the Convention’s entry into force. He shared that the article states that any State party to the Convention which finds that any other State party is acting in breach of obligations deriving from the provisions of the Convention may lodge a complaint with the Security Council. Also, each State party undertakes to cooperate in carrying out any investigation which the Council may initiate, in accordance with the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, based on the complaint received by the Council. In this regard, he said that the Convention does not provide any guidance on the type of investigation that the Council may initiate, while States parties have also not developed any specific guidance or procedures concerning the modalities., On that note, he added that should the Council initiate an investigation, the Office for Disarmament Affairs stands ready to support it. He recalled the High Representative for Disarmament Affairs’ comment that the Convention’s operations and institutional structures must be further bolstered to ensure it is properly equipped and resourced to face future challenges, adding that the Convention’s upcoming ninth Review Conference in November and December is an ideal opportunity for States parties to comprehensively strengthen the Convention., Statements, VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said he requested to convene the Council meeting under article VI of the Biological Weapons Convention to consider the complaint circulated in the Council on October 24 (document S/2022/796), which contains evidence of non-compliance of the Convention by Ukraine and the United States. The Russian Federation’s longstanding concerns pertain to military and biological activities carried out by the Department of Defense of the United States in facilities far from the North American continent and close to the Russian border, he said, adding that the Pentagon’s Threat Reduction Agency carries such activities out in conjunction with private companies, and as such constitute a direct threat to his country’s biological security. Documents unearthed during the Russian Federation’s special operation in Ukraine revealed the true nature of the Pentagon’s activities and contacts with Ukraine, which have been provided in detail to the Council, he said, adding that an analysis proves non-compliance with the provisions of the Convention., Ahead of taking the decision to convene the Council meeting, the Russian Federation did everything it could to settle the situation in a multilateral and bilateral format, he continued, stating that letters were sent to the United States and Ukraine to provide exhaustive answers to these concerns; however, no urgent measures were taken by Washington, D.C., and Kyiv in this regard. He outlined actions subsequently undertaken by his country, including requesting a consultative meeting under article V of the Convention at the end of June, accompanied by “a great volume of documents”. Meetings were then held on 26 August and between 5-9 September, during which every effort was taken by the Russian Federation to resolve issues, hoping they would stimulate Washington, D.C., and Kyiv to introduce measures to rectify the situation. “However, the overwhelming majority of our claims were not reacted to.” Therefore, he said, in line with article VI of the Convention, the Russian Federation turned to the Security Council to lodge a complaint stating that the United States and Ukraine are not in compliance with the Convention., He went on to state that the complaint contains evidence of its validity, citing in this regard excerpts concerning “dangerous pathogens” and infectious disease from the 2005 agreement between the Department of Defense of the United States and Ukraine’s Ministry of Health, titled “On Cooperation to Prevent the Spread of Technologies, Pathogens and Information That Can Be Used for the Development of Biological Weapons”. By 2020, the number of Ukrainian laboratories funded by the Pentagon reached 30, located across 14 towns and villages, he continued, adding that the activities conducted by them were closed in nature. Pointing to vials containing cholera and anthrax pathogens collected by the Anti-Plague Research Institute in Odessa, he said that, given the absence of mass outbreaks in Ukraine, these accumulated volumes are unlikely to be used for peaceful purposes. Stating that such collections include pathogens of dangerous infectious disease, he described research exploring the possibility of spreading such diseases through migratory birds and bats, which can be considered as means of delivery. He went on to state that on 9 March, Russian armed forces recovered from Kherson Oblast containers that could be used to spray bioagents, and also pointed to a certain United States patent involving the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle to distribute infected mosquitoes, which could be used to harm army personnel. It is to investigate such claims, concerning the non-compliance of biological laboratories in Ukraine, that his country has submitted a draft resolution in line with article VI of the Convention to the Council, he said, adding that he hoped the draft will be expeditiously agreed and pass in order to “rectify the unacceptable situation”., MONA JUUL (Norway), expressing regret that the Council is being used again as a “stage for the Russian disinformation theatre,” said that her country is determined to uphold a total ban on biological weapons. While the Government of Norway has meticulously assessed the documents provided by the Russian Federation and listened carefully to the exchanges during the formal consultations under article V of the Biological Weapons Convention, she emphasized that contrary to Moscow’s assertions, the documentation strongly suggests that the cited cooperation between the United States and Ukraine had a legitimate, peaceful purpose. Noting that it is “intolerable” that the Russian Federation repeatedly uses the Convention’s mechanisms to criticize international assistance, she pointed to the need to speak out forcefully and resolutely against attempts to falsely frame peaceful cooperation and assistance activities as a form of non-compliance. Spotlighting that Moscow has repeatedly made allegations concerning Ukraine, including the recent claim that Kiev is preparing to use a “dirty bomb,” she concluded that this is another example of the Russian Federation’s attempt to spread confusion through false narratives and is a reckless escalation of its rhetoric on weapons of mass destruction., AMEIRAH ALHEFEITI (United Arab Emirates), stressing that the Council must be unified in sending a clear message that any use of biological, chemical, or other weapons of mass destruction is unacceptable, reaffirmed her country’s commitment to the Biological Weapons Convention. According to this Convention, biological weapons must never be developed, produced, stockpiled, acquired, retained, or transferred. Recalling also the importance of facilitating the research of biological agents for peaceful purposes, she encouraged all States parties to the Convention to resolve their disagreements through constructive dialogue. Calling for a cessation of hostilities throughout Ukraine and finding a diplomatic solution to this conflict, she added that dialogue is the only sustainable way to avoid the dangerous path that the international community finds itself on., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said that since its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, the Russian Federation has repeatedly spread disinformation, including wild claims involving dirty bombs, chemical weapons and offensive biological research. ""How much more of this nonsense do we need to endure?” she asked, recalling that the Russian Federation’s allegations received a full hearing last month, according to the processes set out under article V of the Biological Weapons Convention, where 89 States parties listened as Russia delivered nothing but misrepresentations of assorted public documents and copy and pasted images from Wikipedia. Underscoring the other States parties’ clear and overwhelming response, she stressed that the Russian Federation must end its aggression and disinformation campaign against Ukraine. Moreover, it must stop demonizing legitimate peaceful scientific and technical cooperation, which all States parties to the Convention have a right to participate in under article X of the Convention. “The bar has not been met for further investigation and proposals for further action would be a waste of this Council’s time,” she said. Instead of attempting to smear Ukraine, the Russian Federation should focus on its own obligations, including the United Nations Charter, and end this war, she added., FERIT HOXHA (Albania), noting that the name of this meeting could have been “Security Council briefing on nothing,” said that issues concerning weapons of mass destruction are very important and the Council should always be ready to do the right thing. However, “there has to be a case and we don't find it,” he said, questioning whether the Council has nothing better to do than succumb to the Russian Federation’s incurable obsession. The only way to verify claims is to use the mechanisms and established procedures that are already in place, he said, expressing concern about the dissemination of false information that does not meet any scientific parameters. The documents presented by the Russian Federation do not present any tangible evidence of violations of the Convention, he said, and recalling the deadly mosquitoes mentioned by that country’s delegate, he asked: “I wonder how those mosquitos would be able to distinguish between Russians and Ukrainians.”, LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said that her country has no biological weapons programme. Moreover, there are no Ukrainian biological weapons laboratories supported by the United States. Ukraine does own and operate a public health laboratory infrastructure, as do many countries that seek to guard themselves from infectious diseases, she said, noting that those facilities make it possible to detect and diagnose diseases. Referring to the Russian Federation’s concerns that biological weapons can be delivered by birds and bats and even mosquitoes, she said the Russian Federation knows that public health laboratories routinely study migratory animal species to assess and counter animal borne pathogens. “Bear in mind that much like Russia, birds and bats don’t tend to observe or respect sovereign borders,” she said. Moreover, even if those species could be weaponized, they would pose as much a threat to the European continent and to Ukraine itself as they would to any other country. It is Moscow that has long maintained a biological weapons programme, as well as a well-documented history of using chemical weapons and shielding the Assad regime which has repeatedly used chemical weapons, she said. There should be an investigation into whether the Russian Federation illegally procured Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles, she continued, pointing out that “we have ample evidence of our claims”, unlike the Russian Federation which has nothing but bizarre conspiracies., CAROLYN ABENA ANIMA OPPONG-NTIRI (Ghana) said that independent and impartial investigations, conducted by the internationally recognized and mandated bodies, should be the only way to establish the facts in reports concerning the threat of use or the potential use of biological or chemical weapons. Underscoring the need to establish an implementation body for the Biological Weapons Convention as a means of encouraging compliance and transparency, she urged the international community to establish a verification regime for the Convention in light of recent global developments such as the COVID‑19 pandemic as well as the continuous deterioration of international security. Voicing concerned over the increasing prospect of the use of weapons of mass destruction in Ukraine, she implored both parties to adhere to international laws and instruments such as international humanitarian law and the Biological Weapons Convention. “The use of biological agents and toxins and other weapons of mass destruction as instruments of war is ruthlessly inhumane, can never be confined to national borders, will leave no winners and should, therefore, not be even contemplated,” she said., TRACY WANJIRU MBABU (Kenya) reaffirmed her country’s support for the Biological Weapons Convention and reiterated its call to all States parties to the Convention to make use of the established mechanisms to ensure there is no ambiguity on the presence of these extremely dangerous weapons. Reiterating the need for restraint and an immediate de-escalation of the situation in Ukraine, she said that Kenya will continue to seek a peaceful solution for the conflict, in accordance with the United Nations Charter., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico), noting that the Council was seized of the same topic in March and May 2022, also drew attention to the convening of the consultations provided by article V of the Convention, in Geneva in September. These consultations did not conclude by affirming that any violations of the Convention took place, he said, adding that the Office for Disarmament Affairs has also indicated that it has no evidence regarding any activities in Ukraine that violate the Convention. The prerequisite for the Council to consider an investigation is the requitement of possession of credible evidence, he said, adding that since the Office for Disarmament Affairs has stated multiple times that it has no evidence, the issue should be brought to the attention of the ninth Review Conference of the Convention which is due to take place next month., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) condemned the Russian Federation’s “umpteenth attempt” to make the Council forget its violation of the United Nations Charter, as well as its use of the Council as a propaganda platform to claim once again that there are offensive biological programmes in Ukraine. The United Nations has clearly stated, on several occasions and again today, that it has no information on this subject. Moreover, the evidence provided by the Russian Federation was examined in detail by the States parties to the Biological Weapons Convention who met in Geneva in September, he said, adding that the absurdity of such evidence was technically demonstrated. Noting the Russian Federation’s request to set up an ad hoc commission for the investigation of the same unfounded allegations, he said: “We all know that it is Russia, and not Ukraine, which used chemical weapons in recent years, and which covered up for years the Syrian regime, which used them against their own people.” Voicing concern that that Russian Federation’s disinformation campaign may be a prelude to the use of a weapon of mass destruction in Ukraine, he rejected any and all pretext for an escalation from that country, urging the Council to concentrate all its efforts on preserving the Convention so that those weapons are never used in the future., GENG SHUANG (China), noting that his country opposes research, development, stockpiling or the use of biological weapons by any country under any circumstances, said that States parties should strictly observe the objectives and principles of the Biological Weapons Convention. Information on biological military activities provided by the Russian Federation deserves a corresponding response by relevant parties, he said, calling on them to take a responsible attitude in effectively fulfilling their obligations under the Convention. Expressing regret that the formal consultative meeting in September had failed to answer the questions raised by Moscow, he suggested that the international community may wish to consider invoking article VI of the Convention to facilitate the establishment of the verification mechanism as a means to ensure its authority and effectiveness. He also expressed hope that the Convention’s upcoming ninth Review Conference in November will be an opportunity to further strengthen the confidence-building mechanism., FERGAL MYTHEN (Ireland) said that it is regrettable that the Russian Federation again brings its baseless and unfounded claims against Ukraine and the United States regarding legitimate public health cooperation and research. Despite the material shared by the Russian Federation, no substantive or credible evidence has been presented to support its allegations, which was also the case at the article V formal consultative meeting of the Biological Weapons Convention. That meeting was a misuse of the provisions of the Convention by Moscow, he added. He commended the substantive responses delivered by Ukraine and the United States to the Russian Federation’s allegations, which set out that its activities represent peaceful cooperation and research. However, he expressed grave concern with Russia’s lodging of a complaint with the Council under article VI of the Convention, emphasizing that further investigation in this regard is neither warranted nor useful. He went on to state that the Russian Federation’s actions risk undermining essential multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation instruments and constitute an attack on legitimate cooperation and research supporting public health in Ukraine and in other countries around the world., JOÃO GENÉSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil) took note of the concerns presented by the Russian Federation regarding alleged biological weapons in Ukraine, as well as the arguments and draft resolution put forth in this regard. Given that it is the first time such a compliant has been brought forth under article VI of the Biological Weapons Convention, it is important to establish a procedure if such issues arise in the future, he said, adding that substantive, solid evidence should be produced if an investigation does proceed. He went on to reaffirm Brazil’s commitment to the resumption of negotiations on a binding protocol on strengthening the implementation of the Convention, and that next meeting of the States parties should engage in such discussions., RAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI (India), stressing the importance of full and effective implementation of the Biological Weapons Convention, underlined the important role of international cooperation in the field of peaceful biological activities and related exchange of scientific and technical information. This is especially crucial for generating equitable benefits for all States parties, including developing countries, he said. The current situation reflects the need to negotiate a comprehensive legally binding protocol that provides for an effective, universal and non-discriminatory verification mechanism to strengthen the implementation of the Convention by States parties. He went on to express concern about the worsening situation in Ukraine and urged both sides to return to the path of diplomacy and dialogue., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon), Council President for October, speaking in his national capacity, called for strengthening the Biological Weapons Convention regime and equipping it with verification and monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance by States parties with its relevant provisions. He further called for a transparent, impartial and independent inquiry to be conducted into the allegations made. Gabon opposes the use of any weapons of mass destruction, he affirmed, calling on the international community to do all it can to put an end to the war in Ukraine by engaging in good faith negotiations for the achievement of lasting peace between the parties. Stressing the need to respond to the urgent humanitarian needs of civilians, he urged all parties to refrain from any provocative posture or deception so as not to compromise the quest for a diplomatic solution., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), taking the floor a second time, said that many Council members accused his country of false alarms, misinformation and distracting them from tackling more important issues, yet none of them responded to the substance of his interventions. Addressing some Western colleagues, he said it is strange that they cannot tell the difference between chemical and biological weapons. To the representative of the United Kingdom, who said his country’s claims have been considered and rejected, he said: “By whom? By you? Your opinions are gospel truth, so clearly, it’s resolved.” None of the responses have been able to answer simple questions put forth by his country pertaining to why the United States, backed by the Pentagon, is engaged in such activities. To the United States’ delegate, who cited statements by the High Representative for Disarmament Affairs as proof of the absence of such activities in Ukraine, he said: “Do they think we are so naïve as to think the United States will tell them about secret biological programmes in Ukraine?” He went on to state that his country invoked article V of the Convention, received no answers, and then invoked article VI. “If you don’t like it, it doesn’t make our actions illegitimate,” he said, adding: “You have no right to ignore them and shift the focus to your political assessments.”, KHRYSTYNA HAYOVYSHYN (Ukraine), calling today’s meeting a “deliberate misuse of the Security Council’s responsibility of maintenance of international peace and security,” said it is obvious that the Russian Federation wants to divert attention from the massive crimes committed in the territory of Ukraine. She reiterated that her country has never developed, produced or stored biological or chemical weapons, nor does it possess infrastructure to do so. She further emphasized that its health laboratories are exclusively for the sake of public health and veterinary protection, and that there are no so-called “American laboratories”. Recalling the formal consultative meeting of States parties to the Biological Weapons Convention held in September, she said that the overwhelming majority of 89 States parties had found the presentations by her country and the United States to be accurate and persuasive, while all allegations by the Russian Federation were rejected. She then recalled Ukraine’s readiness to receive a group of international independent experts to its public health facilities. She went on to say that while Kiev has requested Moscow numerous times to provide the international community with information on the location and status of biomaterials from public health laboratories in occupied parts of Ukraine, no answer has been received so far., UKRAINE, For information media.

Update 121 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (27 Oct 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,27 Oct 2022,"Engineers at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) have been working to stabilize the facility’s fragile external power supplies following repeated outages earlier this month that forced it to temporarily rely on its emergency diesel generators for electricity, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today., While the nuclear safety and security situation at the ZNPP remains precarious, the plant over the past ten days has received the power it needs for reactor cooling and other essential safety and security functions directly and without interruption from the national grid, the Director General said, citing information from the IAEA experts present at the site., In addition, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant currently also has back-up power available - if needed - through the switchyard of the nearby thermal power station. The switchyard was damaged by shelling on 19 October but repaired the following day. In recent days, the back-up power arrangements have also become more robust; a second interconnection at the 330 kilovolt (kV) thermal power plant switchyard was put into operation. This establishes a more reliable connection to the outside 330 kV power line to deliver off-site electricity to the ZNPP, if the main external connection were to fail again., Even with these improvements, Director General Grossi stressed that the ZNPP’s power situation remained vulnerable – only one 750 kV external power line is operating compared with four before the current military conflict in Ukraine – and could deteriorate at any moment., Earlier this month, the ZNPP’s connection to the 750 kV line was cut three times in ten days, with the last such power loss occurring on 17 October. During two of those off-site power cuts, the plant’s emergency diesel generators provided the required electricity, as the back-up system was also down., While there has been no shelling in the area of the ZNPP site over the past week, there have still been military activities in the vicinity of the site. “This is absolutely no time for complacency. The situation could change dramatically at any point” he said., Therefore, the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the facility remains of paramount importance, the Director General said. The Director General has in recent weeks engaged in high-level talks in Ukraine and the Russian Federation aimed at agreeing and implementing a protection zone as soon as possible., At the ZNPP, Ukrainian staff are continuing to operate the plant, but there are more Russian technical staff now working at the site, and Russia has announced it has taken control of the facility, including now taking significant operational decisions, following the creation of a Russian state operating organisation for the site – based in Moscow., Director General Grossi, who has made it clear that he regards the ZNPP as a Ukrainian plant, expressed concern about possible confusion regarding the chain of command for the plant’s operation, which could negatively affect nuclear safety and security., For example, senior Ukrainian operating staff had planned to restart reactor Unit 5 but it currently remains in a hot shutdown mode as Russian officials have not agreed to start it up again. In the meantime, Unit 5 is in hot shutdown providing steam for site operations, but plant staff state that another unit will also need to be placed in hot shutdown to supply all the site’s needs in the future. The site is awaiting permission from Moscow to undertake this., Regarding recent reports about the ZNPP’s dry spent fuel storage facility, the Director General said the IAEA was aware of work that is being carried out with the stated aim to upgrade the physical protection system there. The IAEA team at the site was informed about this work - including technical details - on 14 October. For safeguards and other purposes, the IAEA continues to have access to this facility., Separately today, Director General Grossi reiterated that IAEA inspectors this week would carry out verification activities at two locations in Ukraine, following a written request from the Ukraine government to send teams of inspectors there., Ukraine’s request was issued after the Russian Federation made allegations about activities related to the possible production of “dirty bombs” at the two locations, which are under IAEA safeguards and have been visited regularly by IAEA inspectors. The purpose of this week’s safeguards visits is to detect any possible undeclared nuclear activities and materials related to the development of “dirty bombs”. The IAEA inspected one of the two locations a month ago and no undeclared nuclear activities or materials were found there., “The IAEA inspectors will conduct independent verification at these locations in accordance with Ukraine’s safeguards agreement to detect any diversion of nuclear material under safeguards, any undeclared production or processing of nuclear material at the two locations and assure that there are no undeclared nuclear material and activities,” Director General Grossi said. “As soon as our verifications are completed, we will assess the findings and report our conclusions in line with our standard safeguards practice. However, knowing the interest and urgency of this matter, the Agency will also provide our conclusions to the IAEA Board of Governors and immediately after to the public.” Today, the Director General will be providing an update to the UN Security Council on this matter in a private session.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-121-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-27-oct-2022
Under-Secretary-General DiCarlo: Peace based on international law and the UN Charter is the surest way to end the suffering of civilians in Ukraine,News and Press Release,UN DPPA,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",21 Oct 2022,"UNDER-SECRETARY-GENERAL ROSEMARY A. DICARLO
REMARKS TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON UKRAINE, New York, 21 OCTOBER 2022, Mr. President,, The situation for civilians in Ukraine remains dire., As of 18 October, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has recorded 15,956 civilian casualties: 6,322 killed and 9,634 injured since 24 February 2022. At least 397 children have been killed in the war since 24 February. The actual figures are likely considerably higher., In a recent and concerning development, the Russian Federation launched a series of attacks against cities and towns across the country., On the morning of 10 October, Russian armed forces reportedly launched missiles and drones, killing at least 20 civilians and injuring over 100, including in Kyiv, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia. Many civilian objects – including dozens of residential buildings and critical civilian infrastructure – were damaged., In total, between 10 and 18 October, at least 38 Ukrainian civilians were reportedly killed and at least 117 injured by missile and drone attacks., In addition to immediate loss of life, the United Nations is gravely concerned about the destruction of critical energy infrastructure, such as power plants. According to the Ukrainian government, 30 per cent of energy facilities have been hit since 10 October., Combined with soaring gas and coal prices, the deprivation caused by these attacks threatens to expose millions of civilians to extreme hardship and even life-endangering conditions this winter., To be clear: under international humanitarian law, attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited. So are attacks against military objectives that may be expected to cause harm to civilians that would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated., Mr. President,, The United Nations continues to support all efforts towards accountability. It is essential that the OHCHR be given complete and unimpeded access to all areas of Ukraine to continue its crucial work., For its part, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine submitted its report to the General Assembly this week., The document states that there are reasonable grounds to conclude that war crimes and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in Ukraine since 24 February 2022., The Commission stated that Russian troops were responsible for the vast majority of the violations identified. The Commission also stated that Ukrainian armed forces have committed international humanitarian law violations in some cases, including two incidents that qualify as war crimes., According to the Commission, relentless use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated areas has killed and injured scores of civilians and devastated entire neighborhoods., Additionally, the Commission documented patterns of summary executions, unlawful confinement, torture, ill-treatment, rape and other sexual violence committed in areas occupied by Russian armed forces., The impact of these violations on the people in Ukraine is immense - and so is the need for accountability. In this regard, the Commission called for a sound coordination of the multiple national and international accountability initiatives in Ukraine., Accountability remains crucial as new allegations of atrocities have emerged in areas that have recently returned to Ukrainian Government control., We must not let impunity prevail., Mr. President,, We welcome the announcement on Monday of another exchange of prisoners of war between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. 110 Russian captives were exchanged for 108 Ukrainians. This was the first exchange in which all freed Ukrainians were women – among them civilians, military personnel and national and border guards., Building on the constructive spirit of the prisoner exchanges, I want to reiterate the Secretary-General’s appeal to the Russian Federation to grant full access to the International Committee of the Red Cross to all prisoners of war, in accordance with international humanitarian law., Mr. President,, The global impact of the war in Ukraine is substantial and growing. The UN has detailed its impact on food security, energy and finance., The Black Sea Grain Initiative has helped to bring down food prices and stabilize and subsequently lower global food prices and move grain from one of the world’s breadbaskets to those in need. As of 19 October, the total tonnage of grain and other foodstuffs exported through the initiative had reached almost 8 million metric tons., To maintain food security worldwide, it is critical that the initiative be extended beyond November., It is equally critical that there be unimpeded access to Russian food and fertilizers. The United Nations will spare no effort to achieve greater food security for all populations., Mr. President,, We are on a path of further escalation, which can only cause more suffering to the people of Ukraine, Russia, and the rest of the world. This trajectory must be reversed., Any suggestion of the possible use of nuclear or other nonconventional weapons only serves to further heighten tensions and could lead to a dangerous spiral., Any further damage to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant – whether intentional or by accident – could have catastrophic consequences. Any military activity against, from or near the site, must cease immediately., Mr. President,, The General Assembly has been clear. Last week, it stated that the referendums held in regions of Ukraine that are or have been under the temporary military control of the Russian Federation and the subsequent attempted illegal annexations of these regions have “no validity under international law and do not form the basis for any alteration of the status of these regions of Ukraine.”, This week, the Russian Federation announced the introduction of martial law in the regions of Ukraine under its temporary military control and that it has attempted to illegally annex. This decision, combined with the announced evacuation in Kherson amid intensified fighting on the ground, raises serious concerns., Mr. President,, The General Assembly also expressed strong support for the de-escalation of the current situation and a peaceful resolution of the conflict through political dialogue, negotiation, mediation and other peaceful means, with respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders and in accordance with the principles of the Charter., Indeed, an end to the war founded on international law and the Charter is the surest way to ensure that the tremendous suffering of civilians in Ukraine will cease., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/under-secretary-general-dicarlo-peace-based-international-law-and-un-charter-surest-way-end-suffering-civilians-ukraine

Promoting mental health in Ukraine,News and Press Release,MTI,Health,10 Oct 2022,"Imagine leaving your home, your social network, your job and most of your physical possessions behind. Or consider working extremely long hours every day for months at a time, uncertain when the frantic pace will stop. Now, picture the gravity and significance of sharing your story for the first time after months of either serving or being individuals affected by conflict. This is the story for many in the wake of the crisis in Ukraine and why Medical Teams International is promoting mental health support in Ukraine and Moldova., Addressing mental health needs in Ukraine and Moldova, During our initial assessment of the conflict in Ukraine, Medical Teams interviewed many Ukrainians who expressed increased stress and anxiety amongst themselves, colleagues, community members and society as a collective whole. Individuals spoke of losing all possessions and arriving with only the clothes on their backs. Others shared through tears having to leave elderly family members behind. Civic leaders stated that this is the first time since February that they have stopped to speak of their experience. To address the need for mental health support, Medical Teams hired various mental health workers and managers to run programs for children and adults seeking support. We value the understanding of expertise of local staff, and we work to build interventions that are adapted to the local cultural context in line with global mental health and psychosocial support principles., The core of our activities in mental health and psychosocial support programming focuses on providing dignified care that individuals need in Ukraine and Moldova. One internationally recognized program we provide is psychological first aid, oftentimes utilized in the immediate aftermath of a crisis. The techniques ensure that patients are listened to with respect and that mental health professionals observe patient needs and link them to appropriate resources. We currently provide trainings to volunteers, front-line workers and health staff in both Ukraine and Moldova., Prioritizing mental health in Ukraine and Moldova, Medical Teams stands with all people in recognizing the importance of promoting mental health initiatives. In appreciation of our value that we are Not Alone, a substantial component of our programming provides connections to others as a means of addressing mental health. In Ukraine and Moldova, we work through support groups in coordination with Tutapona to provide training on psychological first aid, support a psychiatric unit, and provide individual case management sessions. Through providing trainings to equip our mental health workers, we address a variety of different mental health needs and strengthen the natural resiliency of child and adult participants., We recognize the crucial importance of mental health and psychosocial support integration into our health response and work relentlessly to make it a priority for everyone. Through prioritizing the mental health of Ukrainians, we hope to see communities continue to come together to support each other in their moment of need. We hope to see people’s well-being improve through finding the support they need. We also hope to see people better equipped with tools to deal with stress and anxiety. Ultimately, we do not know what the future holds, but we do want the people of Ukraine to know that they are not alone as we journey forward together.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/promoting-mental-health-ukraine

Since 10 October, Russian attacks have destroyed 30 per cent of Ukraine’s power stations and damaged other key infrastructure, resulting in blackouts and shortages of clean water across many major cities and towns. The renewed focus of the Russian attacks on civilian areas and infrastructure are a grim reminder of the uncertainty and challenges lying ahead with winter in Ukraine., With many spending time in basements and bunkers, “the destruction of houses and lack of access to fuel or electricity due to the damaged infrastructure could become a matter of life of death if people are unable to heat their homes” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, World Health Organization Regional Director for Europe., Winterization support remains a high priority across the humanitarian response as IOM delivers on preparedness support, including procurement, distribution, light repairs, support for basic needs, and prepositioning of goods for continued assistance throughout the winter months. Provision of fuel and heating devices, including for communal spaces, will also provide acute support including to those affected by damaged infrastructure. Areas in which the government of Ukraine recently gained control are in particular need, and IOM has been amongst the first on the ground to many of these areas to assess the situation and provide acute, life-saving support., The Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine verified that, as of 9 October, there have been at least 15,592 civilian casualties – with 6,221 people having been killed and 9,371 injured since the start of the full-scale invasion. OHCHR also recorded 680 casualties in Ukraine just from 1 to 16 October., The Internal Displacement Report released by IOM on 2 October reported that the total number of internally displaced people (IDPs) in Ukraine decreased from 6,975,000 million to 6,243,000 million, or 732,000 since 23 August. The surveyed population indicated cash as their most pressing need, followed by medicine and health services – 43% of IDPs countrywide also indicated a need for heating appliances for the winter. Another recent report by IOM indicated more than 6 million people who, after being displaced, were back in their place of habitual residence as of 26 September. It remains unclear how recent developments in the war are affecting this group and whether their being in habitual residences is temporary or more long-lasting., In the difficult context currently facing Ukraine, including the damage to its infrastructure and coming winter weather, the Deputy Prime Minster of Ukraine, Iryna Vereshchuk, advised Ukrainian refugees to stay abroad until spring to avoid overburdening the already overwhelmed energy system.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-27-october-2022
Overcoming the many challenges of entrepreneurship in wartime [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,Recovery and Reconstruction,27 Oct 2022,"Virtual crisis management platform helps entrepreneurs to start, restore and/or scale up a business in wartime to meet the needs of local communities, Kyiv, 26 October 2022 – Micro- small and medium-sized enterprises provide a lifeline for people worldwide. Categorized as employing more than seven million people and generating about 70 per cent of value-added in Ukraine, these businesses provide the products and services that people need to survive – especially in wartime. This is why serving this community and ensuring businesses stay in business is a priority for the United Nations Development Programme in Ukraine., With the financial support of the European Union and local partners such as the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia Chambers of Commerce and Industry, UNDP recently established crisis management platforms for local entrepreneurs, supported by Agency for the Regional Development of Eastern Donbas, Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The platforms – a series of online webinars and consultations for SMSEs – were designed to promptly and expertly respond to the requests and needs of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises in conditions of uncertainty and turbulence., Xavier Camus, acting Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation to Ukraine, said that for war-torn communities to survive, it is necessary to offer business tools and mechanisms to quickly and expertly respond to the needs of local entrepreneurs. ""The impact of the war on business is devastating,"" he said. ""We actively support programmes to promote the economic recovery of Ukraine and will continue to focus our efforts on strengthening the activities of the private sector as a vital pillar of Ukraine's resilience."", Manal Fouani, interim UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine, said UNDP is making every effort to provide displaced businesses from eastern and southern Ukraine with opportunities to restore and increase their capacity and efficiency. ""Businesses today face many challenges related to staff retention, profit retention, cost reduction, risk management, responding to opportunities and preparing for the future,"" she said. ""Through our strategic partnership with the European Union and others, we are working with the Government to create and ensure an enabling environment for entrepreneurs to remain resilient despite temporarily limited financial support, constant shocks and other significant challenges."", The crisis management platform included many webinars covering a wide range of topics, including those related to tax changes introduced in Ukrainian legislation to support the economy, legal advice on force majeure circumstances, labour relations in wartime, the challenges of logistics, export and import, and how to restructure supply chains. For many entrepreneurs, the crisis management platform has become a place where participants receive emotional support and motivation to start or continue entrepreneurial activities despite numerous overwhelming obstacles., More than 500 Ukrainians recently participated in online webinars on the three platforms to learn how they can overcome the many challenges of starting, restoring and scaling a business in wartime. Most participants were from established businesses trying to adjust their operations, those that have recently been founded and entrepreneurs who plan to start a new business under martial law conditions., The crisis management platforms were organised by UNDP in partnership with the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the NGO ""Agency for the Regional Development of Eastern Donbas"" within the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme with the financial support of the European Union., Media enquiries: Yuliia Samus, UNDP Ukraine Head of Communications; e-mail: yuliia.samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/overcoming-many-challenges-entrepreneurship-wartime-enuk
Modular homes help people whose homes were destroyed or severely damaged to stay in their communities,News and Press Release,UNHCR,Shelter and Non-Food Items,26 Oct 2022,"Author Victoria Andrievska, UNHCR cooperates with the Government of Ukraine and international donors to help ensure the war-affected people are safe and warm this winter, On the evening of 25 March, a 62-year-old Nadiia, a native of Buzova village was at home. It was her grandson’s 17th birthday, and Nadiia had called him to wish him a happy birthday. Earlier that month, Nadiia’s children and grandchildren relocated to western Ukraine amidst the hostilities in Bucha raion of Kyiv oblast. They had hoped Nadiia would come with them, but Nadiia didn’t feel well enough for the long trip and decided to stay at home, relying on her small cellar – which served as a bomb-shelter – for safety during shelling., Nadiia’s call with her grandson was punctured by the sudden loud noise of explosions nearby. Nadiia immediately ran to the cellar. “Thank God, I remembered to grab a small bag with my documents,” says Nadiia. From the cellar, she heard two further blasts and the walls of the cellar shook. Fearful for her safety, Nadiia stayed put in the cellar until the blasts subsided. , “Nadiia, are you alive?” called a voice overhead. The cellar door creaked opened and Nadiia saw her neighbour’s worried face in the doorway “Yes”, replied Nadiia, slowly getting to her feet and climbing the stairs. Now above ground, Nadiia saw the full impact of the blasts. Fire had destroyed much of her home, but there was no time to waste, Nadiia was still not safe, so she ran, in her light gown through the rubble to hide in her neighbour’s home., The period after the loss of her home was a difficult time for Nadiia. She stayed in several locations, with friends or family. She tried to keep active and volunteered in an area which was liberated and local people were in need of humanitarian support. For about a month she took it upon herself to cook warm meals for displaced persons who had lost their homes., After a few months of temporary accommodation, Nadiia began to yearn to return home . “I cannot tell you how I missed the feeling of being at home. Everything I love and need is here. This land and this community are my home and I don’t need no other”. said Nadiia. “Also, my back was hurting a lot and my health deteriorated as a result of my time in the cellar. I needed a space where I would be able to relax and to heal.”, In September, Nadiia received a call from her local community leader with some good news. She was being offered a new home- a modular house- donated by the Kingdom of Denmark through the UNHCR housing programme. The modular house, to be erected alongside her home, was a temporary solution to bridge the gap until her home is rebuilt. “I was so happy to hear this news!” said Nadiia. “After that call, the construction took only a few weeks, so quick! See, I have chosen my house to be next to my flowers, so I can be close to them,” she says happily., Nadiia’s house is still to be restored, but this winter Nadiia will stay warm and safe in her new home, which is equipped with all the necessary furniture and appliances: a bed, table, wardrobe, fridge, boiler, shower and a stove to cook warm meals., At the other end of the village, another family is having their house-warming., Oksana, a 38-year-old mother of two – 10-year-old Iliia and 5-year-old Nadiika, lives with her husband and her mother. A worker at a local logistics centre, Nadiia lost her job just before the war started and soon afterwards, her home was destroyed during shelling., The family was not in the village at that time as they had relocated to western Ukraine for two months in search of safety. When they came back, their yard was filled with rubble and dust.  “This pile of bricks here – it used to be our bedroom and our kitchen,” shows Oksana “It took us the whole summer to clean the yard.”, “And here, it was our daughter’s room”, she continues, showing a dusty wall where you can still make out a colourful painting of an orange giraffe, walking amongst the flowers and grass., “My daughter still fears planes. She remembers how the war planes were flying over our house and the explosions in our neighbourhood during first days of war,” she says., With the winter just around the corner the family urgently needed a place to live during the cold months ahead. They recently were enrolled in the UNHCR housing program and received two modular houses., “The construction was done really fast, in only a week and a half”, says Oksana. “The children are very excited to sleep in a bunk bed. It is quite unusual for us, but we hope we will be warm here this winter,” she says., Together with Polish Humanitarian Action, UNHCR has erected the first four houses in Buzova village (Bucha raion). The programme is rolled out in Kyiv and Chernihiv oblast where severe hostilities have left thousands of people without homes. Altogether, 95 modular homes will be assembled for families alongside their damaged homes. This means that these families can stay within their communities., The needs across Ukraine are enormous, especially with the onset of winter, and this requires a collective whole-of-society response, led by the government and supported by its authorities, financial institutions and donor countries, private sector, civil society and humanitarian actors. These modular houses generously provided by Denmark are one of UNHCR’s contributions to the collective response to the impact of the war on people’s lives and homes., Overall, UNHCR aims to repair and insulate some 8,000 houses through its light and medium repairs programme, to create or improve 14,400 sleeping spaces in collective centres for IDPs who cannot return home and do not have the means to secure private accommodation. Some 337,000 people will receive cash support to cover increased costs associated with the winter period and 567,000 people will receive essential items like thermal blankets, thermoses and heaters. In total, UNHCR aims to reach more than 900,000 vulnerable individuals in the winterization response to complement the Government’s efforts., To date, UNHCR has assisted over 2,4 million people, displaced or affected by the war. But the needs continue to be significant, and further humanitarian support and the establishment of medium to long-term solutions will be necessary to assist the people of Ukraine in the period ahead.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/modular-homes-help-people-whose-homes-were-destroyed-or-severely-damaged-stay-their-communities
"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia ( 15 - 21 October 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,27 Oct 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, amid the ongoing Russian military invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces continued to target energy infrastructure across Ukraine with missile and drone strikes. Russia imposed martial law in Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine, as well as various states of 'preparedness' across Russia, increasing the emergency powers of authorities. Ceasefire violations continued along the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact. Meanwhile, the death of Mahsa Amini and rising living costs continued to spark demonstrations across Europe., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. While Ukrainian officials have maintained silence about recent developments in their ongoing counteroffensive operation, some Russian sources reported the renewal of Ukrainian assaults in the southern Kherson region (ISW, 16 October 2022). In the Donetsk region, Russian forces continued their attempts to seize the strategically important Bakhmut area (Washington Post, 16 October 2022)., Russian forces continued to strike Ukrainian cities with Iranian Shahed-136 drones and various types of missiles last week, destroying critical infrastructure and reportedly killing over 20 civilians. Such attacks continued to drive demonstration activity across Europe, with rallies against the invasion and in solidarity with Ukraine taking place in Belgium,Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, France,Georgia, Germany,Italy, Poland, and Romania. Additionally, in Georgia, Poland, and Ukraine, people protested against the supply of Iranian drones to the Russian army., Meanwhile, on 19 October, Russia imposed martial law in four partially occupied regions of Ukraine -- Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson -- that were annexed last month. The enactment of martial law grants sweeping emergency powers to Russian-installed governors to meet the needs of the Russian army. The law establishes local 'territorial defense' headquarters and allows authorities to forcibly resettle civilians and set curfews (Al Jazeera, 20 October 2022)., The Russian government also imposed various levels of martial law 'preparedness' across **Russia **and in occupied Crimea. In Crimea and the Russian border regions of Kursk, Bryansk, Belgorod, Rostov, Krasnodar, and Voronezh, the government imposed a 'medium-level' of preparedness, granting authorities powers to relocate residents, to limit the movement of vehicles, and to enact additional security measures at infrastructure sites. Other Russian regions were assigned 'enhanced' and 'basic' preparedness levels, also providing authorities with extra powers to adopt security measures (RFE/RL, 19 October 2022; The Moscow Times, 20 October 2022)., The introduction of martial law 'preparedness' regimes coincided with reports of increased cross-border shelling in Russia. Last week, the governors of the Belgorod and Kursk regions reported 15 incidents of cross-border shelling that hit villages close to the Russia-Ukraine border and damaged infrastructure (The Moscow Times, 18 October 2022). In one incident, an explosion caused a fire at an oil storage facility in Belgorod (TV Rain, 15 October 2022). This violence contributed to the 192% increase in average weekly violent events in Russia in the past month relative to the weekly average for the preceding year. ACLED's Conflict Change Map also warned of increased violence in the country during the preceding four weeks., Separately, several Tajik nationals who recently signed contracts to join the Russian army opened fire at a military training base in Soloti on 15 October, triggering an armed clash. At least 13 people, including the two assailants, were reportedly killed during the shooting. According to some reports, the attack came after a senior officer made derogatory comments regarding their faith (ASTRA, 16 October 2022). At least one of the shooters was reportedly recently pressured to join the military through beatings and threats while in prison (Activatica, 18 October 2022)., Daily ceasefire violations continued along the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact last week, despite the arrival of a technical group from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in Armenia (JAM news, 20 October 2022). The OSCE mission arrived on 21 October at the invitation of Armenia to assess the situation in the border areas following the escalation in fighting in mid-September. Azerbaijani authorities have voiced their opposition to the visit, and as such, the mission is unlikely to foster dialogue between Armenia and Azerbaijan (Asbarez, 24 October 2022)., All ceasefire violations recorded in Armenia last week took place in the Gegharkunik region, contributing to the 100% increase in violent events in Gegharkunik last week relative to the weekly average for the preceding month flagged by ACLED's Subnational Surge Tracker. The Subnational Tracker also warned of increased violence in Gegharkunik during the preceding four weeks. Additionally, two Azerbaijani civilians were wounded in a landmine explosion in the Lachin region., Meanwhile, the death of Mahsa Amini in Iran continued to spark solidarity gatherings across Europe last week for a fifth consecutive week. Rallies in support of the ongoing protests and women's rights in Iran were observed in Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom., Demonstration activity linked to rising living costs, inflation, and energy prices also continued across the region last week, with cross-sector protests held in Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Portugal, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In France, more than 120 such demonstration events were recorded across the country on 18 October, coinciding with a cross-sector strike against inflation and the rising costs of living. This is the second cross-sector strike within the past month. Demonstrations turned violent in Paris and Rennes, where clashes resulted in the arrests of 11 demonstrators and left eight police officers injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-15-21-october-2022

Regional Economic Prospects Report (September 2022): A Cold Winter Ahead? - Confronting the energy crunch,Analysis,EBRD,Recovery and Reconstruction,28 Sep 2022,"EBRD expects Ukraine’s economy to contract by nearly a third in 2022, By Vanora Bennett, Russia’s war on Ukraine will cause the latter’s economy to shrink by nearly a third in 2022, according to the latest forecast by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)., The Bank’s forecast that Ukraine’s gross domestic product (GDP) will contract by 30 per cent this year, issued today in the EBRD’s Regional Economic Prospects report, is unchanged from its previous forecast in May., For 2023, the EBRD has lowered its forecast of an economic rebound to eight per cent from the more robust 25 per cent foreseen in May, when the expectation was that substantial recovery work would already be underway., The reduced forecast is a sign of how heavily uncertainty over the shape of the future is weighing on Ukraine’s economic prospects., Ukraine’s economy, which had grown by 3.4 per cent in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, has been functioning under war conditions since the Russian invasion on 24 February 2022., Though combat operations in more recent months have become more concentrated, covering territory that generates only around 20 per cent of GDP, the devastation of human capital, infrastructure and production capacity has been enormous., Approximately 15 per cent of the pre-war population had left the country as of mid-August, while a further 15 per cent had been displaced internally., Economic activity has been severely disrupted, even in regions without combat activity, due to supply bottlenecks, logistical challenges, financial difficulties and a lack of adequate labour., Russia’s blockade of ports, hampering agricultural exports, and the devastation of many steel-producing facilities in the east of the country have decimated the country’s two main exports, which generated almost half of all pre-war export revenues., GDP plunged by 15.1 per cent year on year in the first quarter of 2022 and by 37.2 per cent in the second quarter, when the most severe and widespread fighting took place., Inflation picked up to 23.8 per cent in August 2022 due to supply disruptions and a soaring iscal deficit., The country’s initial high reliance on monetary financing of the fiscal deficit amid a significant external financing gap had depleted foreign reserves by 20 per cent as of July 2022, despite capital controls being in place., That prompted the central bank to increase the policy rate from 10 per cent to 25 per cent in June and to undertake a one-off 20 per cent devaluation of the currency in July., The situation has since started to improve, in part because of higher inflows of external financing in August and September. As a result, foreign reserves had recouped half of their losses by the end of August., The recent resumption of grain exports from some ports and the expectation of sufficient external financing could be positive factors for economic activity over the rest of 2022., However, the risks to forecasts are exceptionally high, depending on the duration and intensity of the war.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/regional-economic-prospects-report-september-2022-cold-winter-ahead-confronting-energy-crunch
EBRD commits up to €3 billion to Ukraine [EN/UK],News and Press Release,EBRD,Recovery and Reconstruction,24 Oct 2022,"By Richard Porter, Bank leaders meet President Zelenskyy in Kyiv, The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will commit up to €3 billion over 2022-2023 to help Ukraine’s businesses and economy keep functioning., On a visit to Kyiv, EBRD President Odile Renaud-Basso told Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the Bank’s determination to support Ukraine while it defends itself against Russia’s aggression., Since the invasion began in February, the EBRD has committed more than €1 billion, and aims to triple that figure by the end of 2023. Its primary focus will be to support the ‘real’ economy – maintaining energy and food security, restoring rail infrastructure, and supporting the pharmaceutical industry., In their meeting, President Zelenskyy highlighted the damage to the country’s infrastructure, and said the Russians had intensified targeting electricity generation and distribution., EBRD investment has already been made into Ukraine’s electricity companies, as well as providing up to €500m liquidity support for the country’s main gas supplier. Discussions are also underway to scale up funding for urgent repairs of the electricity grid and support municipal authorities in Kyiv, Lviv and Dnipro. EBRD investments are backed by donors or guarantors from countries including the US, and other EU and G7 countries. Norway recently pledged €200m in support., President Zelenskyy thanked the EBRD for its support, and President Renaud-Basso responded by expressing her admiration for the courage and determination of the Ukrainian people., The Bank’s President was accompanied on her two-day visit by Vice President, Banking, Alain Pilloux and the Managing Director for Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, Matteo Patrone. The group held other meetings with the Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, the Mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, and the new Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, Andrii Pyshnyi. They also had talks with business leaders including the heads of the energy company Ukrenergo, the rail company Ukrzaliznytsia, as well as Privatbank and Dragon Capital., After her visit, President Renaud-Basso said: “I was keen to meet President Zelenskyy to express our solidarity and support for Ukraine in person. He left me in no doubt about the scale of assistance needed, and the EBRD is determined to do all it can to play its part., “The EBRD is the largest institutional investor in Ukraine, and has links there stretching back 30 years. It’s is appalling to see the damage done by Russia’s invasion, and yet also moving to see the resilience of the population. I said it on February 24th, and I will keep saying it – we stand by Ukraine.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ebrd-commits-eu3-billion-ukraine-enuk

"Remarks of the Managing Director at the International Expert Conference on the Recovery, Reconstruction and Modernization of Ukraine",News and Press Release,IMF,Recovery and Reconstruction,26 Oct 2022,"As Prepared for Delivery, Berlin, Germany, Good afternoon and many thanks to Chancellor Sholz and President von der Leyen for bringing us together to discuss Ukraine’s determination to recover, reconstruct, and modernize its economy and the role we all can play in supporting its efforts., I will use my remarks today to make three points., First, we recently concluded our 2022 Annual Meetings, where the international community came together to focus on the world’s most pressing economic and financial issues. We had a lot to discuss, and the mood was somber., The world has faced shock, after shock, after shock. First Covid, then Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and now a cost-of-living crisis. Russia ending its war is clearly the single most impactful step to improve the world economic outlook. Short of it, we must work together to limit the damage from these shocks, especially for the most vulnerable countries and people., This brings me to my second point: we are here to discuss urgently needed support to Ukraine, devastated by a war on top of the pandemic. We must support the country’s on-going shift from an emergency phase of economic management to a recovery phase, and also set the stage for a successful reconstruction towards a dynamic and competitive economy, The Ukrainian authorities have earned this support. Following Russia’s invasion they have done an impressive job in managing the economy through extremely difficult circumstances. And the international community has acted decisively — it came together to commit $35 billion in grant and loan financing in 2022 for the people of Ukraine. Building on the laudable efforts of the Ukrainian authorities, this has put a floor under the Ukrainian economy., Disbursements of all committed funds over the remaining months of the year is urgently needed and will make a difference, especially in light of the recent horrific damage to energy infrastructure., From our side, we are acting—the IMF has disbursed $2.7 billion of own resources to Ukraine this year through emergency financing, and channeled an additional $2.2 billion through our Administered Account., But we also need to plan ahead. Ukraine’s financing needs in 2023 are enormous. The country will do its part, but it also needs a strong effort from its partners., Our current assessment is that monthly financing needs in 2023 will be around $3 billion to $4 billion, reflecting the harsh reality of the large fiscal deficit in the context of a devastating war. Should destructions of Ukrainian infrastructure and economic activities become even more far-reaching the range can go up to $5 billion. This funding is for what we classify as the “recovery phase”, during which the economy stabilizes and the country follows an appropriate package of macroeconomic policies., We arrived at these figures working closely with the Ukrainian authorities on the 2023 budget. This is no easy task, as events on the ground are shifting every day and it is very difficult to develop a set of macroeconomic projections as a basis for the budget. In a best-case scenario, we estimate that Ukraine’s financing needs would be about $3 billion per month. When we incorporate some additional financing for higher gas imports and some repair of critical infrastructure, we quickly reach $4 billion per month. The recent missile attacks, which have clearly caused much more damage, not only confirms the validity of these estimates but leads us to consider $5 billion upper range., When we look deeper into damage assessment and reconstruction—what we could call the “reconstruction phase”—the needed financing is truly astounding. The World Bank’s Rapid Damage Needs Assessment estimated total damage at $97 billion, with housing and transport the most affected sectors. According to local experts, the number is already higher — reaching $130 billion. Beyond damage costs the Bank estimates total reconstruction needs in the order of $349 billion., These are truly staggering figures—well beyond Ukraine’s annual GDP of $200 billion in 2021, before Russia’s invasion., This tells us that Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction will require a massive and sustained effort by the Ukrainian people. And we, the international community, are called upon to do our part., This brings me to my final point. How is the IMF helping?, We have built strong relations with Ukraine over the years and from the first day of Russia’s invasion have been supporting the authorities’ macroeconomic policies, both with expertise and financing. An IMF team just concluded an in-person mission in Vienna, working intensively with their Ukrainian counterparts. I’m pleased to report that the discussions were productive and focused on the budget for 2023, financial sector issues, and the mix of policies to support macroeconomic stability., As you would expect, policymaking in the context of a war is incredibly difficult, so there is still a lot of work to do. Our next step is to work with the Ukrainian authorities to prepare for Program Monitoring with Board Involvement—or PMB as it is known. This will help establish a macroeconomic framework and key near-term policies for Ukraine NOW, during the “recovery phase”. The PMB would help catalyze urgently needed support from donors and pave the way for eventually moving to a full-fledged IMF program., The stark challenges faced by Ukraine also underline the importance of high level coordination of financial and economic support. We strongly endorse the Ukrainian proposal to create a financial and economic coordination platform to set priorities, share information, secure financing, and discuss macroeconomic developments, policies, and projections. In my conversations with President Zelenskyy and my meetings with Prime Minster Shmyhal I pledged the IMF’s support for the platform, especially in the areas of our comparative strengths, such as the macroeconomic framework and policies, the size of the financing gap, and modalities for closing it. I agree with President Von der Leyen’s sense of urgency and her call to have the first meeting of the platform as soon as possible., I expect the Coordinating Platform will bring together many of the institutions and governments that are here today—from Ukraine’s bilateral donors to IFIs and national development agencies. Odile is here with me on this panel, and I have no doubt she will be there on behalf of the EBRD. And Werner will talk about the critical support that the EIB can provide — both institutions are crucial to bring the private sector on board and on scale., Let me close with my sincere hope for peace for the people of Ukraine, and for all people in our world., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/remarks-managing-director-international-expert-conference-recovery-reconstruction-and-modernization-ukraine
"World Bank Disburses Additional $500 Million, the Latest Tranche of $11.4 Billion Provided to Ukraine [EN/UK]",News and Press Release,World Bank,Recovery and Reconstruction,26 Oct 2022,"WASHINGTON, October 24, 2022 – The World Bank announced today the disbursement of an additional $500 million to help Ukraine meet urgent spending needs created by the Russian invasion. The IBRD financing is supported by $500 million in loan guarantees from the United Kingdom, announced September 30, 2022, and was mobilized under the Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance in Ukraine (PEACE) Project, which supports continued government capacity, including the provision of core public services such as health, education, pensions and social protection., “The Russian invasion continues to cause massive destruction of Ukraine’s infrastructure – including water, sanitation, and electricity networks – just as winter is approaching, further endangering Ukrainian people” said World Bank Group President David Malpass. “The new portion of financing disbursed today will be used to maintain essential government services. We stand firmly to support the Ukrainian people as they face this unparalleled crisis.”, To date, the World Bank has mobilized $13 billion in emergency financing for Ukraine, including commitments and pledges from donors, of which $11.4 billion has been fully disbursed. The assistance has allowed Ukraine to continue providing essential government services to the population and helped ease the impacts of the widespread human and economic losses caused by the war., In September, the World Bank, Government of Ukraine, and European Commission released an analysis of Ukraine’s reconstruction and recovery needs, the Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA), which estimates the total cost to be $349 billion as of June 1, 2022. This figure is growing as the war continues., According to the World Bank’s recent economic update, Ukraine’s economy is projected to contract by 35% this year. We also expect the number of people living in poverty in Ukraine to rise to around 25% by the end of this year – compared to just 2% prior to the invasion., PRESS RELEASE NO: 2023/ECA/36, Contacts

Shelter and Non-Food Items",26 Oct 2022,"This document is an addendum to the Revised Supplementary Appeal issued in April 2022, reflecting UNHCR’s updated financial requirements for the Ukraine situation for March to December 2022. UNHCR is appealing for an additional $170 million for activities within Ukraine, to scale up urgentlyneeded winterization and other ongoing programmes, under the four-month extension of the Ukraine Flash Appeal issued in August 2022., Updated situation, There are 17.7 million people in Ukraine in urgent need of protection and assistance, including 6.2 million who are internally displaced. Housing conditions for millions of people have become increasingly perilous since the start of the international armed conflict. Displacement, property damage, sudden loss of livelihoods and disruption to supply and access to gas and fuel have left many families living in conditions ill-suited for winter. The situation has further deteriorated in October, as essential civilian and energy infrastructure, residential buildings, public transport, water supply and power networks have been damaged, leaving hundreds of towns and villages across the country without power and access to heating. With the harsh weather quickly approaching, early interventions for winterization are even more critical now to ensure warm, safe, and dignified living conditions for affected people, especially those displaced by the conflict or living in conflict-affected areas., As of 24 October 2022, the international armed conflict in Ukraine has forced over 7.7 million refugees to flee abroad. Many have fled into Poland, while a large number have also sought safety in Bulgaria, Czechia, Hungary, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, Slovakia and other neighbouring countries. A significant proportion have also moved to other European countries. Refugee-hosting countries continue to demonstrate extraordinary solidarity, providing immediate assistance to people arriving, but the scale of the displacement is putting considerable pressure on available services and on hosting communities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-unhcr-revised-supplementary-appeal-2022-addendum-increased-requirements-ukraine-october-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",19 Oct 2022,"OPENING STATEMENT, In March 2022 ChildFund Deutschland and WeWorld joined forces to mitigate the disruption of the Russian attack on Ukraine. A regional response plan was developed and shared with all members of the ChildFund Alliance. The aim is to respond collectively as an Alliance to reduce the suffering of children, families and other citizens in Ukraine and within the neighboring countries., Thanks to the great effort deployed by all ChildFund Alliance Members, we raised the 95% of the 5,8 million USD ChildFund Alliance Regional Response Plan serving 77.000 people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection in Ukraine and Moldova. This has proved the capacity of the Alliance to promptly and effectively respond to this huge ongoing crisis., With the winter approaching ChildFund implementing members, ChildFund Deutschland and WeWorld, have assessed further needs to be urgently fulfilled: 2 additional million USD would increase the number of people in need served up to 85.000 individuals, mainly children and women., SITUATION OVERVIEW, It’s been eight months since the full-scale military attack (invasion) of Ukraine started by Russia in the night of February 23/24, 2022. Towns and other targets in all regions of Ukraine have been shelled or attacked with rockets, artillery fire and other forms of bombardment, as tanks and other military vehicles and personnel invaded the country from three directions (north, east and south). Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion, intense hostilities have left nearly 18 million people in need of humanitarian assistance and protection across Ukraine, an increase of around 2 million people compared to April., Several million people escaped from cities to rural areas, heading west or reaching neighbouring countries such as Moldova, Poland, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. According to UNHCR data more than 7 million Refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe, with over 590.000 people crossed the border via Moldova and more than 90.000 registered in the country. From the total number of 14,7 million refugees and IDPs, approximately 5,5 million people already returned to their destroyed houses in Ukraine (IOM) – this number includes former IDPs from other locations and from abroad., In the Kyiv Oblast(region), the conflict impact on infrastructure is enormous: the most damaged areas are Hostomel and Irpin, where approximately 30% of all buildings are damaged, 40% of facilities are destroyed and 13% of schools are either destroyed or heavily damaged (UNOSAT, IMPACT, MoE). The north of the country is recording the majority of returnees while still hosting around 7% of the total IDPs from other Ukrainian regions, especially the east, where the number of IDPs is still increasing. As people continue returning home, the amount of people in need of humanitarian assistance is still high due to a lack of gas and water supply. The most pressing needs include access to health services and education, as well as rehabilitation of damaged homes., In view of the winter season, the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance is likely to further deteriorate: approximately 628.000 private households and businesses remain without electricity, while winter temperatures are expected to go below -20ºC. Therefore, millions of people who live in unsanitary conditions, who lack adequate personal insulation or access to heating, will be severely impacted.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-regional-response-update-october-2022
Donor platform to help rebuild Ukraine: Expert conference under the German G7 Presidency,News and Press Release,Govt. Germany,Recovery and Reconstruction,24 Oct 2022,"The reconstruction of Ukraine was discussed at an international expert conference in Berlin hosted by the German G7 Presidency and the EU Commission. “Ukraine cannot manage it alone. The European Union cannot manage it alone either. It can only be achieved by the entire global community, which is now lending its support to Ukraine,” stressed Federal Chancellor Scholz., At the international expert conference on reconstruction, Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen assured Ukraine of long-term assistance: “One should be careful about making historical comparisons, but this amounts to no less than the creation of a new Marshall Plan for the 21st century. It is a task that will take generations and must begin now.”, Russia’s war against Ukraine, which was in violation of international law, had already caused many hundreds of billions of euros worth of damage, and the destruction was immeasurable, said Scholz, adding that reconstruction would take decades. As the Federal Chancellor stressed: “Ukraine is not alone in this war, however. It can rely on the support of the international community.”, EU Commission President von der Leyen described the reconstruction as a “colossal undertaking”. “We see President Putin targeting civilian infrastructure to paralyse Ukraine and terrorise its people,” she said. It was not possible to wait until the end of this horrific war before starting reconstruction, she said, it was important to look at what could be repaired right away, such as schools. In addition, she noted, Ukraine needed regular financial support to be able to pay teachers, doctors and pensions., Planning reconstruction now, The global community has been providing support for Ukraine for several months. The G7 states, the European Union and its members have raised over 35 billion euros in emergency aid alone to date. The international community has imposed tough sanctions on Russia, supplied weapons to Ukraine and provided support for Ukraine’s economy, while millions of refugees have been taken in by several countries., Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky gave a keynote speech at the reconstruction conference. “Ukraine and the EU are united and this will not change,” he stressed. Ukraine was defending its sovereignty and freedom, he said, and in doing so it was also standing up for European security., In a speech broadcast live by video, Zelensky pointed out that Russian missile attacks had destroyed much infrastructure in Ukraine – including railway stations, schools, hospitals, power plants and more than a third of the energy infrastructure. Nonetheless, he said, with the help of Ukraine the EU would be able to find a substitute for Russian energy sources. And Ukraine would continue to contribute to food security in Europe and the world in future, he promised – even more so when safe operations were possible again., Creating the basis for a donor platform, Together with G7 partners and the EU and with the support of international organisations as well as Ukraine itself, a basis is to be created for an inclusive and transparent donor platform through which the reconstruction process is to be coordinated, the Federal Chancellor explained. “Last but not least, we’re also laying the foundations for the economy to take off again, for revenues to flow and for citizens to be able to go about their daily lives.”, Both public and private sectors are called upon, The conference was attended by experts, international organisations, think-tanks and scientists as well as representatives of civil society and the private sector. Together they contributed to the ongoing discussion on the reconstruction of Ukraine and provided expert recommendations for the way forward – these will be taken into account when decisions are made on the provision of assistance to Ukraine., “When we talk about mobilising funds to finance reconstruction, for example, I believe that it will require a sustained and coordinated effort involving strong local ownership and participation on the part of Ukraine,” said Federal Chancellor Scholz. Both the public and private sectors of all international partners were needed, added Scholz, as well as the international financial institutions and development banks., The conference focused on the question of how to ensure sustainable, transformative and inclusive reconstruction of Ukraine. The experts discussed these issues in five thematic panels – ranging from lessons learned from previous programmes and a stock-taking of Ukraine’s reconstruction needs and their financing through to the framework conditions required for institutional change and the country’s economic stability., Who were the experts who discussed the reconstruction of Ukraine? Find out more about the participants’ expertise here, Reconstruction in the interests of Europe, “Reconstruction will be an enormous task. We will have to invest a lot to make it work. Ukraine cannot manage it alone. The European Union cannot manage it alone either. It can only be achieved by the entire global community, which is now lending its support to Ukraine,” the Federal Chancellor said. Germany would continue to provide support for Ukraine in close coordination with its partners, he added – during the period of the G7 Presidency and beyond., Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed: “Providing support for Ukraine is not just the right thing to do, it’s very much in our own interests, too.” Ukraine was not only fighting for its own sovereignty and territorial integrity, they said, the country was also defending the international rules-based order – in other words the basis for peaceful coexistence throughout the world., Ukraine has been an EU accession candidate since this summer. Reconstruction will prepare the country for membership of the European Union. This means that support for Ukraine will not only determine what sort of country it will be in the future. It is also key to the future of a common Europe., At the conference, Scholz once again addressed clear words to Russian President Vladimir Putin, too: “Stop this war! Stop this senseless killing! Withdraw your troops completely from Ukraine!”, The International Expert Conference on the Recovery, Reconstruction and Modernisation of Ukraine took place at the Westhafen Event & Convention Center Berlin. It was organised under the German G7 Presidency together with the EU Commission.

Ukraine received more than 700K doses of tetanus-diphtheria vaccine from UNICEF [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Health,24 Oct 2022,"To survive and thrive from early childhood through to adolescence and beyond, children need to be healthy. This enables them to access education so that every child in Ukraine, irrespective of background or circumstance, has an equal chance to fulfill their potential., To ensure children thrive and remain in good health, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has delivered to Ukraine 700,000 doses of tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine to protect children after six and adults., The vaccine is provided as humanitarian aid, free of charge, and will be distributed across Ukraine. Procurement became possible thanks to financial support from the Italian Government., Diphtheria toxin affects the heart, nervous system and kidneys, causing death in 1 in 5 patients. The infection can as well produce a membrane in the throat that can obstruct breathing., People of any age can become infected with tetanus through cuts or wounds if dirt containing tetanus spores gets into a wound. Tetanus affects the nervous system and causes seizures. Mortality can be as high as 70 per cent. The only prevention of tetanus is vaccination., According to the Ukrainian national immunisation schedule, children are vaccinated against diphtheria and tetanus at the ages of two, four, six and 18 months, revaccinated at the age of six and 16 years. It is recommended that adults are revaccinated every 10 years. Vaccination of children and adults against diphtheria and tetanus is free of charge., In September 2022, UNICEF delivered to Ukraine 70,000 doses of diphtheria and tetanus DT vaccine to protect children from six years of age. This delivery was also provided as humanitarian aid., Currently, Ukraine receives vaccines procured by UNICEF with donor funds from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the governments of Japan and Italy. These vaccines protect against poliomyelitis, diphtheria and tetanus, measles, rubella, mumps and rabies. In total, over 1.5 million vaccine doses are being delivered to the country as humanitarian aid., At the end of August, UNICEF also started delivering refrigerated vans for the transportation of vaccines for all regions of Ukraine. The first 14 out of 30 vehicles were handed over to the Regional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine., UNICEF, together with partners, continues to support Ukraine in responding to the emergency humanitarian situation created by the war, including by providing medicines and medical equipment, building the capacity of health care workers, repairing bomb shelters in Ukrainian hospitals, providing assistance to families with children, and conducting educational activities for children, their parents, social workers and teachers., Media contacts

"Snapshot report: The state of communication, community engagement and accountability across the Ukraine response (30 September 2022)",Assessment,CDAC,"Coordination
Protection and Human Rights",26 Oct 2022,"Summary, Since the first edition of the CDAC snapshot of communication, community engagement and accountability (CCEA) across the Ukraine response was published in May 2022, a conscious effort has been made by international, national and local responders to ramp up CCEA action. Progress has been made in establishing coordination mechanisms and launching activities, particularly around accountability to affected people (AAP). As CCEA work continues to scale up on the ground, a greater focus and more effort are still needed on community-facing information and two-way communication; this should be accorded a higher priority than at present., Progress since May 2022, remaining gaps and new opportunities, • There has been a good effort to coordinate AAP mechanisms among actors participating in AAP working groups and task forces, but coordination on communication and community engagement (CCE) that drive the eventual success of these processes remains overlooked. Coordination structures must address this gap and prioritise robust links between the needs of communities, as identified through feedback, and the provision of two-way communication to allow people to make informed decisions. Coordination of information, sharing of two-way communication channels and the engagement of diverse CCE stakeholders, including local media actors and media development organisations, can support this process., • International response actors and established national and local networks and organisations continue to take different approaches to communicating and engaging with affected people. While efforts have been made to bridge these gaps and encourage local participation in international systems, progress has stalled. Barriers around language and terminology and establishing a common understanding of CCEA continue to challenge collaborative ways of working. Notably, during this review period, response actors have observed changes in local actors’ expectations and perceptions around the value of international coordination, further constraining engagement and coordination among CCEA responders., • There remain urgent information needs, increasingly on cash assistance and topics related to support for longer-term integration of refugees. There is a particular gap in information provision in Russian and Romani dialects. In response to the identified preferences of affected people, digital communication and social media have been prioritised – but these have primarily been used as one-way methods of communication and two-way digital outreach is still lacking. This has resulted in low uptake of information, frustration among affected people trying to get in touch with aid providers and potential for misinformation. Greater use of digital communication and technologies to communicate with communities has opened opportunities, but it has also created access barriers for older people, people with disabilities and minority Roma refugees., • The first report noted that the response had been led by the efforts and generosity of host communities, volunteers and local responders to help and accommodate refugees. While the generosity of host communities continues, there is a growing need for greater host community engagement by response actors so as to mitigate tensions, misinformation and rumours in order to support the long-term integration of refugees. This is especially the case as fatigue is starting to set in among host communities and local actors that have been active throughout the response.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/snapshot-report-state-communication-community-engagement-and-accountability-across-ukraine-response-30-september-2022

"Ukraine: CIVIC Calls to Investigate Russian Attacks Killing Civilians, Targeting Critical Infrastructure [EN/RU/UK]",News and Press Release,CIVIC,Protection and Human Rights,25 Oct 2022,"Kyiv/ The Hague, October 25, 2022 – Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC) strongly condemns the latest series of Russian attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, which have had significant consequences on access to electricity, gas and water for around 1.5 million people. In line with international humanitarian law, CIVIC calls for an immediate end to such attacks, which have had a disproportionate impact on civilians and civilian objects, and demand an investigation., Alexander Grif, CIVIC’s Ukraine Country Director, said:, “The recent waves of attacks have plunged civilians into cold and darkness, in what can only be viewed as punitive and condemnable actions by Russian Armed Forces. While some of the infrastructure targeted might be viewed as dual-purpose and a legitimate military object, warring parties should refrain from conducting attacks such as witnessed in recent days as they are disproportionally affecting millions of Ukrainians throughout the country, including far from the frontline. Precautions to avoid disproportionate and indiscriminate harm on civilians appear to have been ignored, and instead, harm on civilians seems to have been the intended aim. We remind all parties to the conflict that they have an obligation to protect civilians from harm and that they should take all possible measures to protect and spare civilian lives as well as civilian infrastructure.”, Over the last two weeks, Russian armed forces have deliberately targeted electrical stations and other infrastructure in major Ukrainian cities such as Kyiv and Lviv, reportedly destroying almost one-third of Ukrainian power stations. These attacks have been conducted with the use of ballistic missiles and so-called “kamikaze’ drones. As a result, several power outages across the country have been recorded, leaving many civilians in a vulnerable situation. In addition to the immediate harm to civilians and civilian objects, such attacks are anticipated to have significant reverberating effects on the civilian population as winter approaches., The war in Ukraine has become a playbook for harmful war tactics to civilians while mounting atrocities continue to be reported. The United Nations’ Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine published on October 18 has found that violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, including war crimes, have been committed in Ukraine. The findings confirm that in too many cases civilian harm has been deliberate and intentional. CIVIC calls for all perpetrators of civilian harm to be held to account., For more information and media inquiries, please contact:, In The Hague: Hajer Naili, Director of Communications: hnaili@civiliansinconflict.org, +31.6.21.69.68.86/ +1.917.889.5982 (WhatsApp)",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-civic-calls-investigate-russian-attacks-killing-civilians-targeting-critical-infrastructure-enruuk
EIB and UNDP expand partnership to help Ukraine rebuild sustainable and energy-efficient public buildings,News and Press Release,EIB,"Contributions
Recovery and Reconstruction",25 Oct 2022,"Berlin, 25 October 2022, The EIB and UNDP have signed a €2 million agreement funded by the multi-donor E5P Fund to assist Ukrainian cities in implementing a €300 million EIB energy efficiency framework loan., This assistance — carried out by UNDP — will contribute to improving the energy efficiency of public buildings, repairing war damage and adapting buildings to host internally displaced people., This agreement signed in Berlin during the International Expert Conference on the Recovery, Reconstruction and Modernisation of Ukraine paves the way for further cooperation to scale up the reconstruction of Ukraine., The partnership aims to save energy against the backdrop of a gas and electricity shortage following an unprecedented series of Russian attacks on the country’s energy infrastructure., The European Investment Bank (EIB) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have signed a €2 million agreement funded by E5P under which UNDP will support selected Ukrainian cities in benefiting from EIB’s Ukraine Public Buildings Energy Efficiency (UPBEE) Programme, a €300 million EIB framework loan with Ukraine aimed at financing thermal renovations of public buildings as well as war damage repairs and adaptations to buildings to ensure they better suit the needs of internally displaced people and hosting communities., The agreement signed today for UNDP advisory support is funded by a €2 million grant from the Eastern Europe Energy Efficiency and Environment Partnership (E5P). The E5P Fund for Ukraine stands at €175 million provided by the European Union, as the largest contributor, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and the United States. Overall, the UPBEE programme is supported by substantial grants of €4 million from E5P for both technical assistance and investments and €5 million for technical assistance from the EU Neighbourhood Investment Platform., Under the agreement, UNDP and the EIB will strengthen the capacity of Ukrainian local governance — approximately 300 Ukrainian municipalities, local state administrations, bodies of local self-government and communal enterprises — and make sure sub-projects are constructed rapidly. In particular, UNDP will support the Ukrainian municipalities during all phases of the sub-project cycle, including the review of energy audits, technical design, tender documents, procurement, monitoring, sanctions screening and commissioning., EIB President Werner Hoyer said: “By signing this new agreement with UNDP, we are supporting the efforts of Ukrainian cities to refurbish social infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and sports centres, making them more energy-efficient and future-proof. The importance of this work has rarely been more salient as Russia targets its aggression — without regard for human lives — at critical Ukrainian energy infrastructure.”, EIB Vice-President Teresa Czerwińska, who is responsible for operations in Ukraine, said: “This agreement will accelerate the reconstruction of Ukraine and make life easier for the country’s internally displaced people.

"War and Peace: Supporting Ukraine to Prevail, Rebuild, and Prosper",Analysis,Open Society Foundations,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Recovery and Reconstruction",24 Oct 2022,"First and foremost, Ukraine’s priority is winning the war and ensuring the safety and security of its people. Ukraine is facing a harsh winter and needs urgent aid and solutions including power generators, heating, and temporary housing to withstand freezing temperatures, ice, and snow. In addition to emergency support, the prime focus of Ukraine’s Western partners needs to be on military and economic aid to ensure Ukraine’s victory against Russian aggression and to support its economy in a time of war., And yet, wherever possible, the recovery and reconstruction of Ukraine should commence during the war to reduce the huge economic and human cost of the invasion and prevent Ukraine’s economic collapse. This should happen concurrently as this huge undertaking requires planning and coordination. It serves as a confidence-building measure for all Ukrainians concerned about their future, and for the West to demonstrate its ability to help Ukraine win the war and recover., A solid plan for the way forward should be based on the following: a predictable flow of financial assistance; a common donor coordination mechanism; a designated Ukrainian institutional partner to manage reconstruction; a steady pace of reforms particularly in the fight against corruption, de-oligarchisation, and decentralisation; confiscating and using the assets of sanctioned individuals and entities to compensate Ukraine; and proceeding with Ukraine’s integration into the EU single market., Ukrainian civil society has demonstrated its maturity as the watchdog and backbone of Ukraine’s democratic progress and EU integration and now—under extreme duress—it is a crucial component of Ukraine’s war effort and resilience. Working with civil society should form the core of a human-centric approach to resilience and recovery., Finally, Ukraine’s victory in this war is not just about defeating Russia on Ukrainian territory and surviving as a nation rebuilt on financially and economically viable model. More fundamentally, it is about ensuring that the country emerges as a successful and prosperous European democracy. Reconstruction efforts should work from this premise to “build back better” a modern Ukrainian with a European future., The authors set out recommendations for making Ukraine’s reconstruction and recovery effective, just, inclusive, accountable, and sustainable.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/war-and-peace-supporting-ukraine-prevail-rebuild-and-prosper

Following the explosion of a bridge linking Russia with Crimea on 8 October, aerial bombardments have intensified across Ukraine, including densely populated urban areas, such as the capital, Kyiv. Critical infrastructure continue to be damaged nationwide by targeted attacks, which is resulting in power cuts with increasing frequency, all while single-digit temperatures have started setting in., While the hostilities continue, the most widespread aerial attacks since the early weeks of war happened on 10 October in cities including Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia, and continued in the following days on 11 and 17 of October in various locations.

"Accessing healthcare in Ukraine after eight months of war: The health system remains resilient, but key health services and medicine are increasingly unaffordable [EN/UK]",News and Press Release,WHO,Health,24 Oct 2022,"Recent WHO health needs survey reveals growing barriers to access, but also points to solutions, 24 October 2022, Kyiv, Even as Ukraine marks eight months of a brutal war, the health care system in Ukraine continues to function overall, but for growing numbers of civilians spiraling costs, logistical hurdles and damaged infrastructure are making access to essential services all the more challenging., Those are among the key findings of a recent health needs assessment conducted by the WHO Country Office in Ukraine, shared with the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, international and national health partners, and humanitarian actors on the ground., The assessment focused on identifying health needs and major barriers to access to primary and specialized care and medicines. The methodology took into account the correlation between income and access to specific categories of medical services and supplies for the 18 and over population of Ukraine., Some of the specific findings include insights from different geographic areas as well as the health needs of internally displaced persons (IDPs). The survey, conducted in September 2022, is the first such assessment since the start of the Russian invasion into Ukraine on February 24., *""People across Ukraine report that the major barriers to accessing health care are cost, time constraints to get to and from health facilities, as well as limited transport availability,"" noted Dr Jarno Habicht, WHO Representative in Ukraine and Head of the Country Office. ""Chief among these is the cost of care. Those who are living intemporarily occupied territories and active combat areas remain the most vulnerable, with one in three reporting reduced access to services and medicines, compared to one in five people nationwide. *, *""At the same time, the findings recognize that as of now the country's health system remains resilient and overall access to some level of health services is still high. From those who sought care, 95 percent report having had primary care services and up to 90 percent had access to health services for chronic conditions. But upcoming wintertime challenges and the latest escalation in fighting could add to a significant burden on the health system, with thousands of civilians living in damaged homes without fuel or power, potentially vulnerable to a range of dangerous cold weather conditions from frostbite to pneumonia. Another challenge is COVID-19 coupled with seasonal influenza, with a significant percentage of the population still unvaccinated for COVID, a worrying situation at a time when respiratory infections traditionally increase."" *, Compounding this scenario are analyses, conducted by the World Bank and UNDP, that the war could push some 60 percent of the population, or even significantly more, below the poverty line. The WHO survey clearly points to mounting economic woes that could further jeopardize the wellbeing of millions., ""The assessment's results could support the Government and health partners to address critical gaps in designing an appropriate medium- and long-term response plan,"" said Dr Habicht. ""We will continue to partner closely with the Ukrainian Ministry of Health to find optimal solutions. Even before the war, Ukraine's health reform process was showing promising results. We must build on that. The commitment to universal health care is real. WHO is here to stay, to support the health system to expand access to health for all, no matter how daunting the challenges may be."", Details of the Health Needs Assessment, Health needs assessment (HNA) is a systematic method for reviewing health issues facing a population, leading to agreed priorities and policies by healthcare decision-makers and managers in the country., Key findings:, Those living in temporarily occupied territories/active combat areas tend to seek healthcare services less than other areas, while IDPs sought services significantly more than the wider population., Access to medicine:, The survey finds that overall, 1 in 5 people (22%) were not able to get the medicine they needed. In temporarily occupied and active conflict areas, this increases to 1 in 3 people. The situation with internally displaced persons (IDPs) is similar., The most frequently cited types of medicines that respondents said were difficult to obtain were:, Medication for high blood pressure: 49%, Medication for heart conditions: 49%, Pain medication: 41%, Sedatives: 33%, Antibiotics: 32%, Main reasons for not getting medicine:, Increased price of medicine: 84%, Unavailability of medicines at the pharmacy: 46%, Households that consist only of women have significantly less income and higher expenses on healthcare services and medicines than households that include men. Household income, not surprisingly, affects the level of access to healthcare services., Access to primary care: Those living in temporarily occupied/active combat areas tend to seek healthcare services less than other areas, while IDPs sought services significantly higher than non-IDPs., Access to care for chronic conditions: 1 in 3 respondents either themselves or a member of their household have chronic disease and more than half of those group (52%) sought healthcare for chronic conditions. The most common being cardiovascular disease (61%), diabetes (25%) and kidney disease (21%). This is a trend WHO continues to see throughout the country. Also, women respondents tend to have higher needs for services and a better chance of getting needed care compared to men., Next round of the assessment: The second round of the health need survey is planned for December to monitor changes in health needs of the population as winter intensifies across the country., Current health response: In response to ongoing, urgent needs, WHO continues to bring life-saving medical supplies into the country. More than 1,350 metric tons of supplies have been delivered to Ukraine since 24 February in coordination with the Ministry of Health. And WHO continues to bring in much needed supplies to newly liberated areas as well, including in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions. Areas including Izium, Lyman, Kharkiv and Sviatohirsk have been reached in the last few weeks with supplies., Besides tangible medical and humanitarian supplies, WHO is also providing capacity building and technical guidance to meet ongoing health needs. WHO has so far trained more than 11,000 healthcare workers on a range of issues including trauma surgery, mass casualties, chemical exposure, epidemiology, and laboratory diagnostics., Mobile health units supported by WHO continue to ensure that medical consultations can reach the most vulnerable and those who have returned to liberated areas. Our focus with partners has been to ensure extended primary care and support in managing chronic conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, in numerous oblasts., WHO is also contributing to the National Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Programme launched by the First Lady of Ukraine to support the wider population. Almost 10 million people at this time are estimated to be at risk of developing a range of mental health conditions, from severe anxiety and stress to post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal tendencies., END, For more information, please contact:, Rayyan Sabet-Parry, WHO Ukraine: rsabetparry@who.int, Tatiana Dolhova, WHO Ukraine: dolhovat@who.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/accessing-healthcare-ukraine-after-eight-months-war-health-system-remains-resilient-key-health-services-and-medicine-are-increasingly-unaffordable-enuk

In NGCA, it was reported that almost 7,000 residential buildings had so far been damaged, 300 educational facilities and hundreds of other civilian objects and infrastructure., Reports that Izium, which has been among the cities reported to be retaken by Ukraine, estimated 1,000 residents had died there, and 80 per cent of the city’s infrastructure had been destroyed. There is an urgent need for health care and medicine and reports that most of the 30,000-plus residents who had fled the city were now looking forward to returning. Most of the now former NGCA of Kharkiv Oblast was reportedly heavily impacted by the war – with water, electricity and other basic services interrupted and much of the land mined, impeding the delivery of aid. World Vision will engage in coordination efforts to address the needs., Lviv and Zakarpatska Oblasts both reported this week preparing for a possible increase in the number of Ukrainians resettling there this winter. The Lviv Oblast Governor reported that they are preparing an additional 50,000 places, adding that as many as 100,000 could move there. Preparations in Zakarpatska oblast reportedly include offering financial incentives for residents hosting internally displaced people.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-response-situation-report-13-1st-30th-september-2022

"Amid New Allegations of Atrocities in Ukraine Regions Returned to Government Control, Political Affairs Chief Tells Security Council Accountability Remains Crucial",News and Press Release,UN SC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",21 Oct 2022,"SC/15074
9161ST MEETING (PM), Delegates Condemn Iran’s Alleged Transfer of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to Russian Federation, as Speaker for Kyiv Requests Scaled Up Aid, Protection, Accountability remains crucial as new allegations of atrocities have emerged in areas recently returned to Ukrainian Government control, a United Nations senior official told the Security Council today as members condemned the recent attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure in the country., Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, outlined that between 10 and 18 October, at least 38 Ukrainian civilians were reportedly killed and at least 117 injured by missile and drone attacks against cities and towns across the country. Expressing concern over the destruction of critical energy infrastructure such as power plants, she recalled that attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law., “We are on a path of further escalation, which can only cause more suffering to the people of Ukraine, Russia, and the rest of the world. This trajectory must be reversed,” she said, underscoring that any further damage to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant could have catastrophic consequences. She further expressed concern over Moscow’s decision to introduce martial law in the regions of Ukraine that are or have been under the temporary military control of the Russian Federation, along with the announced evacuation in Kherson amid intensified fighting on the ground., Denise Brown, United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, reported that temperatures are plummeting in the country as winter approaches amid the devastation of the energy supply, telecommunications and transport infrastructure, affecting access to water, electricity, heat and the ability to communicate. She warned of an increased risk of even more deaths in the months ahead because civilians do not have access to essential services, expressing particular concern over people who cannot be reached in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia., In the ensuing debate, many speakers condemned the alleged transfer of unmanned aerial vehicles from Iran to the Russian Federation in violation of Council resolution 2231 (2015), with the representative of Mexico stressing the need to adhere to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 without exceptions. The degree of sexual and gender-based violence and human trafficking in the conflict was spotlighted by many delegates, with Norway’s representative calling on parties at all levels to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law., The representative of Ukraine, calling attention to the mass graves, illegal annexation of its territory and deliberate attacks on critical energy infrastructure as well as 51,412 civilian infrastructure facilities, urged the United Nations to ramp up its assistance and protection services as well as to provide Kyiv with power-generating equipment. Turning to the use of unmanned aerial vehicles of Iranian origin, he stressed that Tehran must face serious consequences for escalating the Russian Federation’s war of aggression and called for investigations to start immediately., Echoing his point, Ireland’s delegate expressed concern over the use of Iranian-supplied unmanned aerial vehicles as their acquisition by Moscow contravenes Council resolution 2231 (2015). “The unconscionable attacks on civilian targets aim to intimate and terrorize the civilian population, represent a blatant disregard for human life and constitute a serious violation of international law,” he emphasized, adding that the aggressor must also be held accountable for the targeting of civilians, arbitrary detention, human trafficking and conflict-related violence., In the same vein, the representative of the United States pointed out that there is publicly available documentation, including photographs and videos, of Mohajer and Shahed unmanned aerial vehicles being used against Ukraine, urging the United Nations to investigate any violations of the Council resolutions. Addressing the Council members that have never mentioned the Russian Federation, he asserted that “their calls for diplomacy only enabled Russia as it commits further abuses”., As a refute to these allegations, the Russian Federation’s representative described the references to destroyed civilian infrastructure as “one-sided”, as they did not touch on damage inflicted by Kyiv in Donbas as well as acts of terror against a Crimean bridge and on the Zaporizhzhia power plant. If a “pseudo-investigation” takes place in this context, he warned, Moscow could reconsider its relations with the Secretariat, as it would have demonstrated itself as not being impartial., Offering a different perspective, Kenya’s delegate called on States to open channels of communication and for the Council to accelerate its reforms, lest the war in Ukraine be remembered as the beginning of a third world war. “The present format will lose its relevance and be overtaken by competing multilateral arrangements,” he continued. He also emphasized the importance of adequate investments to ensure Africa’s self-sufficiency on food., Touching on the recent exchange of prisoners between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, the representative of United Arab Emirates noted that while momentum towards broader negotiations is still lacking, these exchanges show the potential for positive outcomes, along with agreements on food and fertilizer exports. Compromise, diplomacy, and dialogue remain the only way forward to prevent further suffering, he stressed., Also speaking today were representatives of France, China, India, Brazil, Ghana, United Kingdom, Albania, Gabon (in its national capacity), Slovakia, Germany, Poland and Greece, as well as the European Union in its capacity as Observer., The meeting began at 3:06 p.m. and ended at 5:32 p.m., Briefing, ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said that as of 18 October, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recorded 15,956 civilian casualties in Ukraine: 6,322 killed and 9,634 injured since 24 February. Between 10 and 18 October, she added, at least 38 Ukrainian civilians were reportedly killed and at least 117 injured by missile and drone attacks against cities and towns across the country. Also expressing concern over the destruction of critical energy infrastructure such as power plants, she cited the Ukrainian Government’s report that 30 per cent of its energy facilities have been hit since 10 October, most notably in Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Lviv, Kharkiv and Sumy regions. Recalling that attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law, she deemed it essential that OHCHR be given complete and unimpeded access to all areas of Ukraine to continue its work., Sharing the recent report submitted by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine to the General Assembly, she stated that there are reasonable grounds to conclude that war crimes and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in Ukraine since 24 February. The Commission stated that Russian troops were responsible for the vast majority of the violations identified, while Ukrainian forces have committed international humanitarian law violations in some cases, including two incidents that qualify as war crimes, she pointed out. “Accountability remains crucial as new allegations of atrocities have emerged in areas that have recently returned to Ukrainian Government control,” she emphasized., Welcoming the recent announcement of an exchange of prisoners of war between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, in which 110 Russian captives were exchanged for 108 Ukrainians, she reiterated the Secretary-General’s appeal towards Moscow to grant full access to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to all prisoners of war, in accordance with international humanitarian law. Stressing that the Black Sea Grain Initiative has helped to bring down food prices and subsequently lower global food prices, with the total tonnage of grain and other foodstuffs exported reaching almost 8 million metric tons as of 19 October, she underscored the need to extend the initiative beyond November. It is equally critical that there be unimpeded access to Russian food and fertilizers, she added., “We are on a path of further escalation, which can only cause more suffering to the people of Ukraine, Russia, and the rest of the world. This trajectory must be reversed,” she went on. Further stating that any suggestion of the possible use of nuclear or other non-conventional weapons only serves to further heighten tensions and could lead to a dangerous spiral, she underscored that any further damage to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant could have catastrophic consequences and therefore any military activity against, from or near the site must cease immediately., Recalling that the General Assembly had stated that the referenda held in regions of Ukraine that are or have been under the temporary military control of the Russian Federation and the subsequent attempted illegal annexations of these regions have “no validity under international law and do not form the basis for any alteration of the status of these regions of Ukraine”, she expressed concern over Moscow’s decision to introduce martial law in the regions, combined with the announced evacuation in Kherson amid intensified fighting on the ground. Noting that the Assembly had also expressed support for the de-escalation of the current situation and a peaceful resolution of the conflict through political dialogue, negotiation, mediation and other peaceful means, she added that “an end to the war founded on international law and the Charter is the surest way to ensure that the tremendous suffering of civilians in Ukraine will cease.”, DENISE BROWN, United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Ukraine, noted deaths and suffering of civilians, ravaged urban and rural areas, and total loss of livelihoods for millions are the impact of the war in Ukraine — now in its 239th day. During a recent visit to Mykolaiv oblast, the mayor told her that since 24 February, they have only had 33 days without explosions and air raid sirens. The sheer depth of the humanitarian catastrophe is staggering, with almost 18 million people — more than 40 per cent of the entire Ukrainian population — needing humanitarian assistance, some 14 million forced to flee their homes, including 6.2 million internally displaced, and nearly 7.7 million refugees. The United Nations Human Rights Office has recorded over 15,900 civilian casualties in Ukraine, including 6,300 killed — likely an underestimation., According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), some 5.7 million school-aged children have been affected since the start of the war, including 3.6 million due to the closure of educational institutions. She noted the World Health Organization (WHO) says there have been over 630 verified attacks on health care, barring the sick from medicines and treatment. Temperatures are plummeting in Ukraine as winter approaches, after the devastation of the energy supply, telecommunications and transport infrastructure, affecting access to water, electricity, heat and the ability to communicate. She warned there is an increased risk of even more death in the months ahead because civilians do not have access to essential services. International humanitarian law is very clear, she stressed: attacks must never be directed against civilians or civilian objects and constant care must be taken to spare them., Aid focus is now on household repairs and the provision of blankets, mattresses, clothes, food, generators for schools and much-needed thermal heating for hospitals, with more than 590 humanitarian partners now delivering critical assistance and protection countrywide, she said. She noted over 13 million people have been reached across the country, but in accessible areas of Kharkiv, Kherson and Donetsk, the threat of landmines and unexploded ordnance contamination hinders humanitarian operations. The Ministry of Health and WHO report that 10 million people will need psychosocial support due to the trauma from the war, including women and girls suffering sexual violence and other forms of gender-based violence, children hearing warning sirens daily, families who have been separated, or people just trying to survive every day., She expressed particular concern over people who cannot be reached in Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia. The consequences of not delivering assistance to the estimated millions of people in these areas are dire, particularly with the winter months already having arrived — and obstructions that leave the civilian population without the essentials to survive run contrary to this obligation. She noted the Flash Appeal has seen unprecedented donor support — more than $2.9 billion has been received against requirements of $4.3 billion for this year. This is second most-funded country-level appeal in United Nations history, only behind Yemen in 2019 at $3.6 billion. The Ukraine Humanitarian Fund has also received significant new funding with more than $230 million in contributions and pledges, she noted, and of that, $117 million has already been disbursed, including $20 million for local volunteer organizations., Statements, JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said the figures of dead and wounded civilians in Ukraine will continue rising unless urgent action is taken. In light of the recent indiscriminate attacks against civilians and infrastructure, including those using unmanned aerial vehicles, which violate international humanitarian law, Mexico and France called for the meeting to discuss an analysis and solutions to the unfolding situation. He emphasized the need to adhere to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 without exceptions. Turning to the grave impacts on health services, with the WHO finding that there had been 630 recorded attacks against health-care systems, he stressed that the deliberate targeting of hospitals constitute war crimes and cannot go unpunished. Expressing alarm about cases of sexual and gender-based violence, he called for all such cases to be investigated and for effective redress provided to victims. Further, unfettered access to humanitarian assistance must be provided, and attacks against civilian infrastructure must cease. Turning to the issue of mines, which affect the safe operation of humanitarian assistance and pose challenges to agriculture, he called for urgent demining operations to be conducted. Moreover, the Black Sea Grain Initiative must be renewed to mitigate the conflict’s impact on global food security. He went on to repudiate the threat of use of nuclear weapons and expressed regret that no safely demilitarized zone has been formed around the Zaporizhzhia power plant, despite recommendations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and appeals from the Secretary-General. Mexico urges parties to urgently heed these appeals, he said., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) noted the Russian Federation has crossed a new threshold, pounding the cities of Ukraine indiscriminately for 10 days and deliberately choosing to strike civil infrastructure, in particular energy, in Kyiv, Sumy and Dnipro, and no longer even trying to conceal its crimes. By targeting civilians, Moscow is unabashedly violating international humanitarian law and the Charter of the United Nations, trying to terrorize and break the morale of the Ukrainian nation. It is banking on the suffering of civilians, including children. He urged Moscow to comply with international humanitarian law and to allow humanitarian actors access to civilian populations in the territories it claims to occupy, as well as to prisoners of war, including those placed in captivity in the Russian Federation. The abuses and destruction resulting from the aggression may constitute war crimes, and there will be no impunity for criminals. He called for the International Criminal Court to move forward quickly, going up the chain of accountability as far as it can. It is further well documented that the armed forces use Iranian drones in Ukraine, and the European Union yesterday adopted new sanctions against Iranian entities and individuals involved in the production and transfer of these drones. He called on Iran to immediately cease all forms of support for the war of aggression launched by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. He also condemned the complicity of Belarus, whose territory continues to be used for missile strikes. The General Assembly vote last week was final, he stressed: the Russian Federation is alone, and massively condemned by the international community., MICHAEL KAPKIAI KIBOINO (Kenya) expressed concern over the escalation in military activity and the persistent threats regarding the use of weapons of mass destruction. All nuclear installations, including the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, must be protected, he urged. As the continued intensification of the conflict only further undermines the prospects for peace and potentially gives way to the strengthening of armed alliances in preparation for a protracted war, he called for the immediate cessation of hostilities. United Nations agencies must be granted unhindered humanitarian access to those in need, he continued. Efforts to deploy emergency food and energy security mechanisms must be accompanied by efforts to transform food systems in food-insecure regions. To that end, there must be adequate investments to ensure Africa’s self-sufficiency on food. In pleading for the war in Ukraine to not be remembered as the beginning of a third world war, he called on States to open channels of communication and for the Council to accelerate reforms. The present format will lose its relevance and be overtaken by competing multilateral arrangements, he warned., GENG SHUANG (China) called on all parties to comply with international humanitarian law. Nuclear power plants, energy pipelines, bridges and other critical infrastructure are of great importance to public safety and social stability, he said, while urging all parties to exercise restraint. He further called on the international community to continue to provide humanitarian assistance and help neighbouring countries in ensuring the proper resettlement of conflict-affected peoples. The international community must also maintain the interrupted operation of global food, energy and financial markets by removing obstacles to international, economic and trade cooperation. The implementation of indiscriminate sanctions will only accelerate the transmission of the crisis by pushing up international commodity prices and destabilizing the global and industrial supply chain, leaving developing countries especially exposed to its deleterious impacts, he cautioned. The past eight months have proven that sanctions, pressure, bloc confrontation and political isolation are not effective ways to resolve the crisis, he added. He then spotlighted his country’s six-point initiative on the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, its international food security initiative and its emergency humanitarian assistance for Ukraine., RAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI (India), describing the recent reports of attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine as “deeply worrying”, noted that international principles and jurisprudence vest responsibility on parties to ensure that they are not targeted in situations of armed conflicts. Highlighting that all humanitarian aid and assistance must be primarily guided by the universal principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, he stressed that these measures must not be politicized. Pointing out that the conflict has exacerbated concerns over food, fertilizer and fuel security, particularly in the developing countries, he said that “open markets must not become an argument to perpetuate inequity and promote discrimination”. Expressing hope that the grain deal agreed in July will be implemented by all parties earnestly, he added that this alone may not be sufficient to address concerns over food insecurity. Hoping that the international community will continue to respond positively to the call for humanitarian assistance, he expressed support for calls urging for guarantees of safe passage to deliver essential humanitarian and medical supplies., MOHAMED ISSA ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates) noted that in just one week, a third of Ukraine’s power stations are reported to have been knocked off the electricity grid at a critical time, leaving people without gas for cooking and heating with winter approaching. The international community must step up its support, and to this end, his Government announced $100 million in humanitarian aid earlier this week. However, other parts of the world cannot be neglected, and the international community must ensure that those most in need globally do not become an afterthought. In Ukraine, access remains a major hurdle for humanitarian organizations, and those unable to escape the fighting, such as people with disabilities, the elderly, and the sick, have become vulnerable to shifting battle lines. He reiterated the call on all parties to abide by their obligations under international law to ensure the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, including energy infrastructure. Despite the deeply concerning developments, he noted some movement between the parties that has led to tangible, positive outcomes on concrete issues. While momentum towards broader negotiations is still lacking, prisoner exchanges show the potential for positive outcomes, and agreements on exporting of food and fertilizers were significant and positive steps. Compromise, diplomacy and dialogue remain the only way forward to prevent further suffering, he stressed., JOÃO GENÉSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil) expressed regret over the continued suffering of Ukraine’s civilian population. There is no justification for the attacks perpetrated on civilian targets, he said, while noting the damage to the energy sector and its humanitarian impacts. The continuing reports of civilian casualties and attacks against civilian infrastructure attest to the need for opening channels of humanitarian dialogue, he stressed. Missile launches and drone strikes must be halted and unimpeded access to humanitarian assistance by those in need must be guaranteed by all parties. Turning to the Council’s collective response to the conflict, he noted the increased frustration with the perception of insufficient efforts to facilitate a peaceful solution. The Council should actively contribute to all possible efforts towards a ceasefire, which includes exploring the ideas which have already been circulated, he urged., JEFFREY DELAURENTIS (United States) stressed that the Russian Federation has shown contempt for the Council since the beginning of its invasion. Pointing out that Iran has since August transferred Mohajer and Shahed unmanned aerial vehicles to Moscow, in violation of Council resolution 2231 (2015), he stated that these vehicles have been used in multiple attacks against Ukraine, including the massive barrage on 10 October that hit civilians and civilian infrastructure. Highlighting that there is significant publicly available documentation, including photographs and videos, of such vehicles being used against Ukraine, he urged the United Nations to investigate any violations of the Council resolutions. As a refute to “Russia’s false assertion” that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to captured foreign volunteers, he emphasized that Moscow’s obligations as a party to the Conventions and their first additional protocol apply to the detention and treatment of any individuals, including third-country volunteers. Addressing the Council members that have never mentioned the Russian Federation, he asserted that “their calls for diplomacy only enabled Russia as it commits further abuses”., FERGAL MYTHEN (Ireland), in spotlighting the continued attacks on Ukraine’s critical civilian infrastructure including on hospitals and health-care facilities, said the Russian Federation has chosen the path of escalation. He expressed concern over the use of Iranian-supplied unmanned aerial vehicles as their acquisition by the Russian Federation contravenes Council resolution 2231 (2015). The unconscionable attacks on civilian targets aim to intimate and terrorize the civilian population, represent a blatant disregard for human life and constitute a serious violation of international law, he emphasized. The Russian Federation must comply with its obligations under international law and international humanitarian law, refrain from further escalation, prevent civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure and facilitate lifesaving humanitarian access without delay. The Russian Federation must also be held accountable for the targeting of civilians, arbitrary detention, human trafficking and conflict-related violence. There must be timely, credible investigations which rigorously document evidence and support witnesses, victims and survivors, he said, while appealing to the Council to assert its responsibility., KHALILAH HACKMAN (Ghana) noted too many people, especially women, children and the elderly, continue to suffer needlessly from the fighting that has engulfed many cities across Ukraine. The humanitarian statistics are indeed concerning, and it is also important to note the impact of the war on pre-existing humanitarian situations in other parts of the world where food aid is largely supplied from Ukraine. She called for the de-escalation of tensions and the intensification of diplomatic efforts to end the war now, rather than later, when the cost of reconciliation and reconstruction would be unbearable. Expressing gratitude for United Nations humanitarian agencies and their partners working under extremely difficult and dangerous operational circumstances, she welcomed the European Union announcement to provide Ukraine with humanitarian aid through the winter. As fighting intensifies, she called for new humanitarian corridors for the safe passage of civilians to areas of relative safety, recalling the success of the Mariupol evacuations. Condemning all human rights violations, she reiterated support for independent, transparent and thorough investigations of such violations, including conflict-related sexual violence. Apart from imposing severe hardships on the people, she warned that the deliberate destruction of energy infrastructure, water stations, hospitals, schools, ports and railroads all constitute gross violations of international law and the principles of international humanitarian law relating to armed conflict., JAMES KARIUKI (United Kingdom), in noting the renewed campaign of drone and missile strikes across Ukraine as well as the egregious attacks on Ukrainian civilians’ way of life, emphasized the impact on Ukrainians as winter approaches. The intent behind these attacks is clear, he said. The Russian Federation is subjugating Ukraine by instilling fear and attacking civilians using weaponry obtained from Iran in violation of Council resolution 2231 (2015). As its illegal and immoral actions must end, he called on the Russian Federation to stop its disinformation, misdirection and accusations that the West is responsible for the Russian Federation’s atrocities. It must heed the calls of the international community; respect its obligations under international law; stop the attacks on civilians, energy infrastructure and health facilities; and end the war, he stressed., MONA JUUL (Norway) said the briefers’ candid accounts leave no doubt about the devastation the war has brought upon the people of Ukraine, and affirmed that Norway will continue to stand with Ukraine and its people, against the Russian aggression, which is a gross violation of international law, and the United Nations Charter. She expressed alarm about the escalation and brutality of the recent seemingly deliberate Russian attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, with missiles and drones, which have killed civilians and hit power facilities across the country. “These attacks have no military purpose”, she said, adding: “The aim seems to be to terrorize the population. They are illegal and may constitute war crimes.” On the human rights front, she expressed concern about sexual and gender-based violence and human trafficking, which women and children are particularly exposed to, calling for their return to be facilitated. Pointing out that inquiries by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine has concluded that Russian armed forces have committed violations of human rights and international humanitarian law amounting to war crimes, she called for justice for all victims, for survivors to be cared for and for all those responsible to be held accountable. “But to stop these grotesque violations in the first place, this war must come to an end”, she stressed, calling on parties at all levels to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law, including through support for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in fulfilling their mandate., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) began his statement by expressing his puzzlement at the added value of including Slovakia, Poland and Greece in the meeting, stressing: “This is not a debate but a briefing.” He went on to characterize references to destroyed civilian infrastructure as “one-sided”, as they did not touch on such damage inflicted by Kyiv in Donbas, and acts of terror committed on a Crimean bridge and on the Zaporizhzhia power plant. Recalling statements that the meeting was called due to an intensification of air strikes by the Russian Federation, he said: “Let’s take a look”, and proceeded to describe attacks over the past two months by “the Ukrainian regime and their Western backers”, including some that employed “Ukrainian terrorist methods of sabotage”. Such methods “peaked” on the attack on a Crimean bridge, which permitted the delivery of essential supplies to the peninsula, on which four people died, he said, stating that the crime was openly savoured by Ukrainian officials, with one even implying their responsibility for this strike., He went on to state that his country knows what Kyiv is capable of after 8 years in Donbas; therefore, it countered the “anti-people Zelensky regime” using high precision missile strikes and the use of Russian drones to target infrastructure. “This did not sit well with the West, who became hysterical”, he said, adding that plenty of cases exist on video of civilians and infrastructure targeted by the Ukrainian Defence Forces. Instead, he stressed, Ukraine and its Western backers are trying to publicize fake claims of violations of Council resolution 2231 (2015), taking issue with a letter disseminated by Germany, France and the United Kingdom today which appeals to the Secretariat in violation of Article 100 of the United Nations Charter., “The United States went further, demanding an investigation, which the Secretariat has no authority to undertake”, he continued, calling the action outrageous. If such a “pseudo-investigation” takes place, the Russian Federation can reconsider its package of relations with the Secretariat, as it would have demonstrated itself to not be impartial, he warned. He went on to characterize the briefing as a smokescreen, which sought to portray Ukraine as “an innocent victim in constant need of military assistance”. He went on to enumerate military equipment given to Ukraine by the United States, France and Germany, and cited instances of such equipment being wielded on Donetsk and Luhansk, and indiscriminate artillery shelling taking place on Russian territories. He also touched on other provocations, including the targeting of a dam on the Karachunivske Reservoir, and the reckless attacks on the Zaporizhzhia power plant. Further, he said Kyiv was responsible for attacks on its own civilians seeking to save themselves, including in the instance of a ferry shelled on 20 October, in which the wounded and killed included journalists. Moreover, the Russian Federation has not yet received a list of Ukrainian victims in Bucha, he said, adding that Ukraine has no evidence to confirm what they claim happened there, while Western countries take their words at face value. He went on to state that he would prefer not to listen to the spiteful tirades from the Ukrainian regime, which takes a strange perverse pleasure in doing so, adding: “Regrettably, his outburst shows Kyiv’s lack of readiness for any type of dialogue, much less for a civilized one.”, FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said the Russian Federation’s attacks and targeting of key civilian infrastructure is another and higher level of cruelty. He urged the United Nations to verify that the drones used by the Russian Federation have been unlawfully imported from Iran in open breach of resolution 2231 (2015). What does the Russian Federation have to hide from an independent, impartial investigation as a routine exercise to examine evidence, he asked. Turning to the United Nations reports documenting patterns of summary executions, unlawful confinement, torture, ill-treatment, rape and other sexual violence, he said these monstrous atrocities, war crimes and crimes against humanity would one day be presented before a court. He then expressed concern over the formation of a new joint force between the Russian Federation and Belarus. Every denial regarding Ukraine had the exact opposite happening, he noted. In recalling the resounding response of the General Assembly, he called on the Russian Federation to end the war., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon), Council President for October, speaking in his national capacity, noted the war in Ukraine is more and more deadly, with the humanitarian situation deteriorating, civilians and civilian infrastructure continue to be attacked and the use of unmanned war machines adding to the climate of terror. It is time for the Council to mobilize to put an end to the war, he stressed. Today, the international community is still taking an inventory of fears, atrocities and humanitarian distress, leaving every nation to side with one camp or the other, he noted. Silencing the guns is certainly the main aspiration of the Ukrainian people right now — the aspiration of all people plagued by the insecurity generated by war — and he called on the belligerents to respect international humanitarian law and Council resolutions. He further urged for a humanitarian truce in order to preserve access to drinking water, electricity, heating, medical care and the distribution of humanitarian aid, calling on the parties to engage in good faith negotiations to end this deadly war and achieve peaceful coexistence in the region., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine), in expressing regret that the Council must listen to continued lies, said the Russian Federation will one day be removed from the Council altogether. In reminding the Council of the Russian Federation’s words that its military does not pose a threat to Ukraine’s peaceful civilians nor impact critical civilian infrastructure, he spotlighted the mass graves, illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory and deliberate attacks on critical energy infrastructure and 51,412 civilian infrastructure facilities. He urged the United Nations to ramp up its assistance and protection services and provide Ukraine with power-generating equipment. As every part of the Russian regime is soaked with blood and permeated by crime, it is not surprising, he observed, that the Russian Federation has chosen a new commander who is infamous for his bloodthirsty and criminal nature., Russian terrorists, he continued, have mined the dam and aggregates of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, whose destruction would subject more than 80 settlements and hundreds of thousands of people to rapid flooding. There must be an international observation mission and the return of Ukrainian personnel to the power plant to prevent another act of terror and ensure immediate demining. Turning to the use of long-range unmanned aerial vehicles of Iranian origin, he called on States to stop the transfers of such vehicles, missiles and conventional arms. As Iran must face serious consequences for escalating the Russian Federation’s war of aggression, investigations should start immediately, he emphasized. The world must react preventively, he urged, to not let Kakhovka or another disaster happen., MICHAL MLYNÁR (Slovakia) condemned the Russian Federation’s ongoing, unprovoked and unjustified aggression against Ukraine. In expressing concern over the humanitarian situation, he was appalled by innocent civilian deaths, attacks on critical infrastructure and the scale of sexual- and gender-based violence. The Russian Federation does not understand the phrase “enough is enough”, he said before noting the impact of energy infrastructure attacks on people’s access to water and heat. Turning to global food security, he called on the Russian Federation to enable the free and safe passage of agricultural delivery and shipping from Ukrainian ports. While no one can predict when the senseless war will end, reaching a truce and silencing the guns is not enough. Perpetrators cannot remain unpunished and must be brought to justice, he declared. In recognizing Ukraine as an independent, sovereign State with unquestionable territorial integrity, he urged the Russian Federation to fully implement the General Assembly resolution from 12 October., ANTJE LEENDERTSE (Germany) said her country will continue to stand by the United Nations Charter wherever in the world it is breached and will continue to stand by Ukraine. Germany stands ready to support Ukraine in mitigating the devastation caused by the Russian Federation’s attacks, she affirmed, noting that next Tuesday Chancellor Scholz and President von der Leyen will host the “International Expert Conference on the Recovery, Reconstruction and Modernisation of Ukraine” in Berlin. The conference will galvanize international support for Ukraine’s recovery and reconstruction, she added. The Russian Federation must change its course, fully respect the letter and spirit of the Charter and withdraw from Ukraine. Further, it must comply with the legally binding order of the International Court of Justice to immediately stop its military operations against Ukraine and withdraw., KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI (Poland) noted the recent Kremlin decisions on military mobilization and illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory, coupled with aggressive nuclear rhetoric and mass air strikes against civilian infrastructure, indicate that Moscow has chosen the path of escalation. The Russian Federation wants to intimidate the civilian population and to destroy Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, which is critical, especially in the winter period. Due to the Russian Federation bombings over 3.5 million people are left without a roof over their heads, and there is the further issue of mines deliberately left behind by its forces. Shelling civilians is a war crime, he stressed. Civilians must not be taken hostage. Russian Federation forces have committed horrific atrocities, and Poland will continue to work with international institutions and Ukraine to ensure that those responsible for these barbaric acts are held accountable. His country is now home to over 1.3 million refugees. Emphasizing that the whole tragedy is purely man-made, he said the Russian Federation bears full responsibility for all the destruction and loss of life. He noted 143 Member States strongly reaffirmed Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in its internationally recognized borders. This confirms without any doubt that no concessions are expected from Ukraine for peace to occur. He appealed to the members of the Council and the international community to increase pressure on Moscow to stop the war, enabling the international community to restore the shattered lives and livelihoods of Ukrainian people. “Give peace a chance,” he urged., BJÖRN OLOF SKOOG, Head of Delegation of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, stated that the Russian Federation must be held accountable for its violations of international humanitarian law, as evident in recent air attacks targeting critical infrastructure and terrorizing civilians in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. He also condemned the clandestine transfer of combat drones by Tehran to Moscow in its aggression against Ukraine, adding that the damage to the country’s energy infrastructure creates major challenges in view of the upcoming winter. Stressing the importance of collecting, consolidating and analyzing evidence of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights abuses, he expressed support towards measures to ensure accountability, including investigations by the International Criminal Court. “Responsibility extends to those who support the committed crimes — first Belarus, and now Iran,” he added. Highlighting that the deliberate destruction of Ukraine’s agricultural and transport infrastructure is causing global food supply chain disruptions, he showed support for the Secretary-General’s call to extend the Black Sea Grain Initiative beyond 19 November., MARIA THEOFILI (Greece), aligning herself with the European Union, condemned the recent drone attacks as having far-reaching repercussions affecting vital civil infrastructure and leading to an inhumane, continuous and merciless shelling targeting innocent lives. Reiterating her country’s readiness to support the rebuilding of a maternity hospital destroyed by Russian shelling in Mariupol and to contribute to the reconstruction of Odessa, she further shared that it has worked for the promotion of the candidacy of the historic centre of Odessa for inscription on the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage list. Highlighting that her Government has responded effectively to the needs of tens of thousands of Ukrainian citizens seeking refuge from the war, she shared that it has welcomed more than 75,000 refugees, including unaccompanied minors separated from their families. She added that Athens is engaged in the restoration of key ports and storage facilities in the north African region, thus facilitating the storage and transfer of Ukrainian grain across the continent., For information media.

Ukraine: Statement at the Conclusion of an IMF Mission [EN/UK],News and Press Release,IMF,Recovery and Reconstruction,21 Oct 2022,"Vienna, Austria: The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Mission Chief for Ukraine Gavin Gray issued the following statement today:, “During October 17–20, an IMF staff team met with the Ukrainian authorities in Vienna, Austria. The mission discussed its findings with Finance Minister, Serhii Marchenko, and Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, Andriy Pyshnyy., ``The Russian invasion of Ukraine that started over seven months ago has caused tremendous human suffering and had a severe economic impact. Real gross domestic product (GDP) has contracted significantly, inflation has risen sharply, trade has been substantially disrupted, and the fiscal deficit has risen to unprecedented levels., ``Against this challenging backdrop, the discussions focused on recent macro-financial developments and outlook, the budget for 2023 and associated external financing needs, financial sector issues and the mix of policies to support macroeconomic stability. The Ukrainian authorities deserve considerable credit for having maintained an important degree of macro-financial stability in these extremely difficult circumstances. The authorities are encouraged to refrain from measures that erode tax revenues, as they strive to align expenditure with available financing., ``Building on these productive discussions, staff and the authorities will advance work in the coming weeks to follow up on the authorities’ request for Program Monitoring with Board Involvement (PMB). The PMB will lay out the authorities’ policy intentions to support macroeconomic and financial stability and present an assessment of external financing needs for 2023. As such, the PMB will also provide a strong anchor for macroeconomic policies, further catalyze donor support, and help pave the way toward a fully-fledged Fund program. ”, IMF Communications Department

More Than 3 Million Liters of Safe Water in Ukraine,News and Press Release,Water Mission,Water Sanitation Hygiene,17 Oct 2022,"Water Mission has been responding to the crisis in Ukraine since the conflict started in February. This August, we produced nearly 800,000 gallons (3 million liters) of safe water for impacted people in Ukraine. This milestone was only possible with support from generous friends like you., Shipments of emergency water treatment equipment and water purification supplies over the past several months have allowed the continuous flow of clean, safe water in multiple cities throughout Ukraine. We have installed 30 safe water systems in four different cities. We plan to install another 10 systems by December., “Recently, a city of 40,000 people had its municipal water system destroyed,” reported Josh Burns, Water MIssion’s disaster response team lead. “Within 48 hours, our team had safe water flowing for those in need.”, In Mykolaiv, two reverse osmosis (RO) systems provide nearly 800 gallons (3,000 liters) of safe water per hour. The Ukrainian Red Cross Society relies on these systems to fill water trucks and deliver safe water throughout the city. Smaller RO systems are located at public access points, such as churches and healthcare facilities, where men, women, and children can retrieve clean, safe water day and night., “Each system provides people with a source of hope and consistency in a time of chaos,” Josh shared., Our teams have also assembled and distributed hygiene kits for refugees fleeing the conflict and those displaced inside Ukraine. These kits are stocked with sanitary supplies to help people stay healthy., In partnership with local churches and organizations, Water Mission has printed bibles and trauma healing materials in Ukrainian. These resources help ministry leaders share God’s love with those experiencing tremendous loss.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/more-3-million-liters-safe-water-ukraine
Area Baseline Assessment: Ukraine - Round 14 (3-16 October 2022),Assessment,IOM,Protection and Human Rights,21 Oct 2022,"KEY INSIGHTS, • Round 14 includes information from 979 out of 1,319 hromadas in the covered areas (75%)., • Among oblasts, Kharkivska (413,793), Dnipropetrovska (342,228) and Kyivska (329,756) have the highest number of displaced persons., • At the raion level, Kharkivskyi, Kyivska, Zaporizkyi, Dniprovskyi, Poltavskyi host the highest number of recorded IDPs, with over 99,000 each., • Of the total IDPs, the majority have been displaced from Donetska, Kharkivska and Luhanska oblasts., • Out of the 146 cities/towns that reported IDP figures, Kyiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, Kryvyi Rih and Odesa recorded the highest displacement figures, OVERVIEW, The Area Baseline assessment provides granular data on the number and geographic location of officially recorded internally displaced persons (IDPs). Data collection for the Area Baseline assessment Round 14 took place between 3-16 October across 21 oblasts and Kyiv city. In the areas covered, the number of recorded IDPs was collected for all 106 raions and 979 hromadas (75 per cent of all). In addition, gender disaggregated figures were provided across 63 per cent of hromadas– of those areas, 65 per cent of registered IDPs were females and 35 per cent were males., This report assesses registered IDP presence at the hromada and oblast-levels, while also mapping the percentage change since the previous round. It further highlights the rate of change at the macro-regional level and charts the registered IDP figures at the raion-level across the previous 8 rounds., IOM’s glossary defines IDPs as persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized state border. Operationally, for this assessment, interviewers define and understand IDPs as persons who officially registered as fleeing their habitual place of residence due to the current war in Ukraine., Disclaimer: The data in this report was sourced from official IDP data recorded by hromada officials. As such, it likely represents an undercount of those who have been forced to flee their homes.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/area-baseline-assessment-ukraine-round-14-3-16-october-2022

Ukraine: Russian attacks on critical energy infrastructure amount to war crimes,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,20 Oct 2022,"Reacting to the news that Russian attacks on energy facilities in Ukraine over recent days have led to a nationwide blackout in the country, Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said:, “The strategy behind Russia’s latest warfare tactics is unmistakable. In bombing Ukraine’s critical civilian infrastructure, including energy facilities, the Russian army clearly intends to undermine industrial production, disrupt transportation, sow fear and despair and deprive civilians in Ukraine of heat, electricity and water as the cold grip of winter approaches.”, “Russia’s targeting of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure is unlawful. The morale of the civilian population is not a lawful target, and carrying out these attacks with the sole purpose of terrorizing civilians is a war crime. All those responsible for ordering and committing these criminal attacks must be held to account. With Russia ramping up its efforts to terrorize civilians in Ukraine, the international community must urgently respond and condemn these heinous attacks.”, Background, On 20 October, the Ukrainian authorities announced that there will be power outages across the country, after Russian attacks over recent days seriously damaged about 40% of the country’s energy facilities., Amid efforts to repair the damaged facilities, the Ukrainian authorities have resorted to planned power outages to ensure the remaining energy infrastructure is not overloaded., The Ukrainian authorities have also urged people across the country to minimize their electricity use between 7am and 11pm each day, while the use of street lights will also be limited nationwide starting today.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russian-attacks-critical-energy-infrastructure-amount-war-crimes
Ukraine Crisis: 8-14 October 2022,News and Press Release,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,20 Oct 2022,"Posted: 20 October 2022| Region: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia | Category: Infographics, Suspected Ukrainian forces triggered an explosion that severely damaged the Kerch bridge connecting Russia with occupied Crimea on 8 October. Four Russian civilians were reportedly killed in the explosion. The bridge is an important supply and logistics artery for Russian operations in southern Ukraine (New York Times, 8 October 2022). While Russian state sources claim a truck bomb was used in the attack (Meduza, 8 October 2022), some analysts have argued that the attack may have been carried out with a drone or explosives attached to the bottom of the bridge (Molfar, 11 October 2022)., In response to the attack, Russian forces launched missile and drone strikes across Ukraine on 10 October, hitting critical infrastructure and civilian buildings in over a dozen regions, including the cities of Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro, and Zaporizhia, reportedly killing at least 20 civilians (Suspilne Media, 11 October 2022). The strikes destroyed 30% of all Ukrainian power stations, causing power outages across the country (Volodymyr Zelensky, 18 October 2022; Ukrinform, 11 October 2022). Additionally, dozens of civilians in Zaporizhia were reportedly killed in Russian airstrikes and shelling on 9 and 14 October., In the Donetsk region, Russian forces engaged in offensive operations in the direction of Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Soledar (ISW, 8 October 2022). In the Luhansk region, Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the direction of Kreminna and Svatove (ISW, 12 October 2022)., For more information, including previous infographics and an interactive dashboard, visit our Ukraine Crisis research hub.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-8-14-october-2022

These attacks on civilian infrastructure are depriving people of essential electricity and water and exacerbating humanitarian needs., The Ukraine Ministry of Energy assessed that 30% of Ukraine’s energy sector has been damaged since last Monday, with hundreds of towns and villages having lost power. The targeting of energy sources will hamper the country’s ability to face winter. Speeding up the winter response in the current context is critical., UNHCR’s top priorities are to deliver the winterization response and critical assistance to people living in the newly liberated areas, and to design and implement our housing, protection, and assistance programs in a way that supports the recovery and durable solutions of IDPs, returnees and conflict-affected people. Throughout the planning and delivery of our programmes, UNHCR works closely with the local and national actors to reinforce national ownership and sustainability and ensure that UNHCR’s response effectively complements national systems.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-emergency-unhcr-operational-response-delivery-updates-19-october-2022-enuk

Water Sanitation Hygiene",20 Oct 2022,"The situation in Ukraine is worsening significantly as Russia continues to attack civilians and civilian infrastructure in major Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv. Regardless of Russia's actions, we at People in Need will continue to help the most affected. We are focussed on humanitarian aid, delivering food and drinking water, and conducting small and medium repairs to houses to help people survive winter. At the same time, we are also focusing on education and rehabilitation of schools in the Sumy Oblast. In the last month alone, we have fixed the water system in several settlements, including recently liberated areas where people did not have access to water, electricity, gas, communication, and other essential services for many months., Since the start of the invasion, we have provided aid to more than 500 thousand people worth more than €40 million, and we have 264 colleagues on the ground., We are still providing direct assistance to Ukrainian refugees in ten regions of the Czech Republic. In September, we supported 3,079 people and served another 849 at the Ukrainian helpline. More than 1,300 participants have already joined our language course for Ukrainian teaching assistants., Please read the latest summary of our assistance in Ukraine and the Czech Republic over the past month., Contents, AID IN UKRAINE, AID IN CZECH REPUBLIC, AID IN MOLDOVA, AID IN UKRAINE, Fixing windows and rooves and providing long-term solutions to water supply problems, €22,5 MILLION WORTH OF AID, Cold winter months, where the temperature will drop below zero, are approaching fast in Ukraine. Our team is now focused on light and medium repairs of the houses in Sumy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Kyiv, and Zhytomyr Oblasts. We are fixing the windows and roofs of damaged homes, and more complex repairs will follow in the coming weeks. At the same time, emergency shelter kits with tarpaulin, wood, and plastic sheeting that enable basic repairs are being distributed in Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Dnipro Oblasts, and as newly liberated areas of Donetsk Oblast., In Zakarpatska oblast we reconstructed 3 buildings that will accomodate 36 internally displaced people from other parts of Ukraine. The repaired buildings are equipped with furniture or kitchen appliances. By the end of October other 5 objects for 207 people should be reconstructed. Altogether 14 objects for 528 people will be prepared before the end of the year., “In several settlements where the water system was heavily damaged and was not operational for several months we are offering long-term solution. In newly liberated Balakliia, Derhachi or in Eshar and Alkhivska hromada we delivered pumps and necessary equipment that was installed and ensured centralized water system running,” says Sergey Saienko, East Region Director for People in Need Ukraine., Additionally, we continue to deliver bottled water to newly liberated areas such as Balakliia and Izium in Kharkiv Oblast and Sviatohirsk or Lyman in Donetsk Oblast. People in these areas were supported with food and hygiene kits, and likewise in Kupiansk and Borova. Furthermore, water has been delivered to Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in Donetsk Oblast., ""There is no running water, no heating or electricity, and people are on the verge of starvation. We have no medicine; we are still in shock,"" says Victoria from Izium. Her town was liberated on 11 September, and People in Need immediately sent aid to help the neediest with drinking water. ""During the occupation, there were 22,000 people left, 89 in our house, among them seniors, children, and diabetics. We had no medicine; we had nothing to eat; we heated our food over candles. We drank rainwater, which we drew from a well,"" she adds. When asked what she would need most now, she replies: tarpaulins and protection from the cold. And, of course, water., Besides these cases, we have provided a lot of help across the country in the last month. For example, in the east of the country, we delivered food to more than 13,800 residents of Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv and Donetsk Oblasts. Food aid was also given to 9,100 people in Zaporizhzhia and Mykolaiv Oblasts. Basic hygiene supplies, which cannot be bought in these places, were also needed, and we supplied them to 18,000 people., For many people, collective centres are still the only safe places where they can rest, warm up, and children can learn or even just be children and play for a short while. We support soup kitchens in ten collective centres in Lviv Oblast, so more than 500 people can have two hot meals daily. We also regularly deliver hygiene supplies to the collective centres., We recognise the need to focus on restoring children's education. That is why we will make temporary repairs to schools in the Sumy Oblast and provide teachers with psychological support for the children and themselves. We will also repair schools or provide other assistance related to education in the Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast., Psychological support in schools, collective centers or local administration, €101,000 WORTH OF AID, Eight months of war have traumatised millions of Ukrainians. We understand that we need to treat this trauma, which is why we continue providing psychosocial and mental health support to children and adults via a telephone hotline and our mobile psychological teams. Individual and group counselling is offered to people in collective centres, schools, or in local administration for the staff and visitors., The psychosocial hotline works nationwide, and our teams regularly visit people in Lviv, Vinnytsia, Dnipro, and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts. We have also built and equipped child-friendly spaces in many centres. Here children can play and learn again., Shop according to one's needs, €13,5 MILLION WORTH OF AID, In just the first three weeks of September, we, together with our partners, registered 1,184 people for cash distribution in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast and another 1,264 people in Lviv Oblast. The most vulnerable families receive the equivalent of CZK1,700 in hryvnia each month for a quarter of a year; this cash enables them to shop according to their needs., AID IN CZECH REPUBLIC, €3,2 MILLION WORTH OF AID, We are still directly assisting Ukrainian refugees in ten regions of the Czech Republic. In September, we supported 3,079 clients and served another 849 on the Ukrainian helpline. More than 1,300 participants have joined our language course for Ukrainian teaching assistants. We also continue using the SOS Ukraine Emergency Appeal funds to help partner organisations nationwide., Our assistance to refugees includes cooperation with schools and municipalities, support for community activities, adaptation, education, social work and counselling, humanitarian aid, a pilot social housing project, and analysis and feedback from the field necessary for decision-making in crisis management. We continue our cooperation with the Consortium of NGOs working with migrants and meet with the management of the National Assistance Centre for Ukrainians., ""In a difficult psychological state, they turned to the police and our office in Ústí nad Labem. We offered them psychological and legal support, help with processing humanitarian benefits and material assistance."", We focus on the most vulnerable—people with health or mental health problems or other particular needs—for example, Olena, a mother of a four-year-old and a fourteen-year-old son. She works two jobs to provide for her family and plans to start a business. ""We helped them find a more stable home than just a room in a hostel so that they could breathe more freely again after the trauma they had experienced,"" says Svatava Havelková Svobodová, coordinator of field workers at our Central Bohemia branch., We provide employment counselling and protect refugees, We continue to monitor the situation in the hostels where many newly arrived Ukrainians are still housed. We are helping twenty people, including children, in the Olomouc region. While they have become accustomed to the local kindergarten or school and their parents have gained employment, they are at risk of eviction. We are also continuing to support a modular social housing project in the town of Pečky, which should primarily be used to house Ukrainians. Time is running until 29 October to submit proposals., We are providing job counselling to job seekers while also trying to protect refugees from abuse. Natalia was employed through an agency that also provided her with accommodation. After six weeks, she lost both. Not only did she need a new roof over her head, but with our support, she could deal with the fact that her employer had not paid her wages. Sisters Olga and Tatiana had a similar experience. The cleaning company they worked for owed the women three months' pay. ""In a difficult psychological state, they turned to the police and our office in Ústí nad Labem. We offered them psychological and legal support, help with processing humanitarian benefits and material assistance. Now we are helping them to find new jobs and overcome the feeling of abuse and disappointment,"" explains Helena Mourečková, the fieldwork coordinator of the Ústí nad Labem branch., Very often, we mediate medical care. We continuously update information in Ukrainian on our main website. We continue to organise and coordinate help centres for refugees, supporting their integration. For example, our Pilsen branch prepared an event focused on the lives of foreigners, especially war refugees from Ukraine, during which people could learn about the stories of Ukrainian women or taste Ukrainian specialities., In cooperation with partners, we have newly helped thousands of refugees, We have established cooperation with the Volunteer Centre in Ústí nad Labem to support Ukrainian refugees. In the framework of our partnership with the online Medical Advisory Service for Refugees ulekare.cz, 8,289 inquiries/consultations were handled from June to September, mainly in general medicine, pediatrics, gynecology and dentistry. And in cooperation with the Hlavák Initiative, we supported 5,826 clients in September; initially with assistance at Prague's Main Station in light of the crisis caused by the overloaded Labour Office in Holešovice (now in Prosek) and in monitoring the situation at offices in other Prague districts., The helpline team has resolved hundreds of more complicated requests, As part of our work on the Ukrainian Helpline (+420 770 600 800), we deal with more complicated requests beyond the usual queries handled by the back office team. Callers are often looking for accommodation, specific material assistance, requiring legal analysis, or requesting crisis interpretation. Since the launch of the helpline, the team has registered 630 cases, most of which have been resolved. Requests are dealt with for hours, days, or weeks until they are resolved. It also involves multiple organisations in the solution., ""My colleague Anna was looking for employment for a blind gentleman who is a trained masseur. In cooperation with the municipality and an organisation helping the blind, within three months, they managed to arrange employment in a sheltered workshop, move the whole family to another region for this, and arrange all the necessary documentation and other related matters,"" says counsellor Alena Čorna., We tutor Czech and school subjects. We recruit volunteers, In education, we also respond to individual needs; for example, Nikita, a seven-year-old first-grade pupil, has a severe visual impairment. He needed to be examined at the eye clinic and a special education centre by a typhlopedist. Our support resulted in the confirmation of an individual education plan and the provision of special treatment., We continue to organise adaptation groups for Ukrainian children. We focus on supporting adolescents 15+, helping them prepare for entrance or matriculation exams. For students in a poor socio-economic situation, we offer the possibility of a scholarship programme. We provide the necessary technology for online studying and home preparation and distribute donated textbooks and dictionaries., We organise, arrange or facilitate Czech language courses. We have started tutoring through a virtual branch that connects volunteers with families in an online environment. Those interested in volunteering can apply at doucovani@clovekvtisni.cz., We also held the first meeting of a regular focus group of Ukrainian teaching assistants, primarily graduates of our online Teach Me This course. We published the results of a survey on teaching about migration. The work of Ukrainian and bilingual teaching assistants in schools was also one of the main topics of the conference with teaching assistants for better schools., AID IN MOLDOVA, €651,000 WORTH OF AID, In Moldova, we support families who have provided shelter to people fleeing war. At the same time, we help run a helpline in Ukrainian and Russian. As part of a new pilot project on Education in Emergencies for Ukrainian Refugee Children in Moldova, our team is completing the preparatory work for opening a digital education for children., Many places in Moldova have been transformed into refugee centers overnight, including a social canteen. Mothers with children, in particular, find accommodation there for short and more extended periods. Local volunteers have prepared a program of activities for the people in the refugee center, such as cooking classes for local specialties.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/help-more-half-million-people-while-situation-ukraine-worsens-encs
Two new reports reveal war’s impact on small businesses in Ukraine and present a number of recommendations to safeguard the sector [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,Recovery and Reconstruction,20 Oct 2022,"Kyiv, 20 October 2022 – As Ukraine prepares for the recovery, it should focus more on the specific needs of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), according to two new reports issued today by the UN Development Programme and PricewaterhouseCoopers Advisory (PwC) with the financial support from Switzerland., While one of the reports presents the results of a Rapid Assessment of the War’s Impact on the MSME Sector, the other is an Outlook Study on the Development of MSME Business Membership Organizations (BMOs) and their Business Development Services in Ukraine., Rapid Assessment of the War's Impact on the MSME Sector involved a thorough assessment of secondary data (desk research) to identify areas where immediate interventions to support business recovery could stimulate and support sustainable post-war growth. The research takes into account the current state of business activity of MSMEs in different regions and sectors, key challenges caused by the war, and the support available to MSMEs from various stakeholders such as the government, local authorities, donor organizations and the private sector., The results of the Rapid Assessment suggest that the war has exacerbated pre-existing challenges faced by MSMEs while creating new ones. In particular, the population's forced internal and external migration has created a labour shortage in many areas. The disruption of supply chains and the reduction in domestic demand for goods and services have forced MSMEs to look even more actively for new partners and customers. The reduction of bank lending has significantly reduced MSMEs' access to financial resources for working capital and capital investments. The risks and consequences of hostilities, such as loss or damage of assets, threats to personnel and information security, and destroyed infrastructure, have added to the new challenges. Exporters are forced to overcome additional logistical difficulties in accessing international markets due to the limited capacity of roads and railways., The good news is that after an initial suspension of operations, MSMEs are gradually resuming their activities. Some of them have had to relocate to safer areas while others have had to reorganize their businesses and transform. However, the MSME sector is unlikely to fully recover to the previous year’s capacity by the end of this year. To support recovery, the sector needs support for business renewal, rebuilding supply chains, creating new connections and business partnerships, optimizing costs and getting financial support., The Outlook Study was conducted in several stages during 2021 and 2022, covering five macro-regions and 1,000 Ukrainian MSMEs, focus group discussions with business representatives of different sizes and interviews with key sector experts, as well as analysis of international best practices in the development of business associations and business development services. It presents suggestions for reorienting their role and service provisions in Ukraine, taking into account best international practices, the specific local context, the impact of the war, and the acute and anticipated needs of local MSMEs. The Study was conducted within the framework of the Swiss-Ukrainian Project ""Strengthening MSME Business Membership Organizations in Ukraine"" implemented by UNDP in Ukraine in cooperation with the Ministry of Economy of Ukraine and with the support of Switzerland., The results of the comprehensive Outlook Study show that the level of BMOs’ membership among MSMEs remains low: only 22 percent of respondents are current members of BMOs. Yet, the number has increased by 2.5 times over the last five years, from just 9 percent in 2017. The share of current BMO members is higher among companies with women among the owners and top managers (24 percent against 19 percent). In terms of industry representation, the largest number of BMO members (44 percent) are operating in the agriculture and food industry, with manufacturing and construction (26 percent) second and the service industry (22 percent) sector is third., Massimo Bloch, Programme Manager, Private Sector Development, State Secretariat for Economic Affairs of Switzerland (SECO), said MSMEs provide a lifeline for people across Ukraine. “These businesses provide the products and services people need to survive— especially in wartime,” he said. “The businesses from different sectors united by UNDP’s partner BMOs are crucially important for Ukraine’s economic recovery. This is why supporting the BMOs, which demonstrate commendable resilience and continue to provide services to MSMEs despite challenging circumstances, is a priority for Switzerland. We hope these two reports will help Ukraine and the international community to develop appropriate interventions to support this sector.”, Manal Fouani, UNDP interim Resident Representative in Ukraine, said that MSMEs play a significant role in Ukraine's economy, employing more than seven million people and generating about 70 percent of value-added. “UNDP, through its strategic partnership with Switzerland and others, will continue supporting the recovery of this sector so as to keep the economy running and to secure livelihoods – especially during wartime,” she said., The studies present a comprehensive assessment of the challenges and needs of Ukrainian businesses and of the organizations that support them. They also formulate a set of recommendations to strengthen the BMO’s operations and service offerings, suggesting direction and a plan of action on how we can intervene and collaborate to ensure a full recovery of the sector., Anna Onyshchenko, Advisory Director at PwC Ukraine, said the effective interaction between MSMEs and BMOs has had a synergistic effect. “Effective communication and constant feedback from their members is helping business associations to understand the needs and demand for specific business development services, which in turn is increasing the loyalty and stability of the membership base,” she said. “Financially and organizationally strong business associations that are motivated to provide quality and demanded services to their members can contribute to the further development of MSMEs, and thus the recovery of Ukraine.”, Media enquiries: Yuliia Samus, UNDP Ukraine Head of Communications; e-mail: yuliia.samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/two-new-reports-reveal-wars-impact-small-businesses-ukraine-and-present-number-recommendations-safeguard-sector-enuk
Outlook Study for Ukraine on Advancement of Business Membership Organizations and Business Development Services [EN/UK],Analysis,UNDP,Recovery and Reconstruction,20 Oct 2022,"The “Outlook Study for Ukraine on Advancement of Business Membership Organizations and Business Development Services” aims at strengthening business membership organizations (BMOs) and their service offerings, taking into account best international practices and the context, vision and needs of local MSMEs in Ukraine., The study was conducted in several stages during 2021 and 2022, using both primary and secondary data. The primary data collection consisted of representative samples from five macro-regions collected from a survey of 1,000 Ukrainian MSMEs, from focus group discussions with business representatives of different sizes and interviews with key sector experts.

Providing care to displaced people in Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia,News and Press Release,MSF,Health,20 Oct 2022,"Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been working in Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia, regions that first hosted displaced people from Mariupol, Berdiansk, Melitopol and other settlements not currently controlled by Ukraine. According to Ukrainian officials, about 300,000 displaced people moved to the Dnipropetrovsk region, and about 100,000 — to Zaporizhzhia., Since May 2022, MSF teams have conducted almost 8,000 consultations on non-communicable diseases in the area, providing patients with medicines.“We see a real need for people living with non-communicable diseases,” says Gilles Grandclément, MSF project coordinator in Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia.“The biggest issue we see by far is cardiovascular disease, followed by respiratory and musculoskeletal conditions in people who have left their homes and will likely have long journeys to reach places where they can find new accommodation and continue their lives,” says Gilles., “Patients with non-communicable and chronic diseases need medication on an ongoing basis, it’s not easy to get the medicines they need when on the move,” he says., Since May 2022, MSF teams in the region have visited 82 temporary shelters for elderly people and families with children. Three mobile clinics operate in Dnipro and two in Zaporizhzhia. In addition to providing medical services, MSF is helping shelters prepare for the winter. MSF provides centres for displaced people with important supplies, such as hygiene kits, diapers for babies and medical items, while also supporting the renovation of the premises., Stanislav Kramskyi, a nurse, works in the mobile clinics in Zaporizhzhia, providing primary healthcare and mental health consultations, as well as free medicine. Many people, including children, suffer from the stress and trauma of the war., “Seeing the children of the war, I can divide them into two categories. The first one includes emotionally unstable children who are hard to communicate with and are often distressed,” Stanislav explains. “The second category includes children who had to grow up prematurely. Their eyes, behaviour and thoughts are of an adult. Same story with this family. The elder daughter who is about 10 years old behaves as if she is adult, just like her mother, while the younger one needs care.”, Seeing the children of the war, I can divide them into two categories. The first one includes emotionally unstable children who are hard to communicate with and are often distressed. The second category includes children who had to grow up prematurely. Their eyes, behaviour and thoughts are of an adult., The MSF mobile team in Zaporizhzhia consists of five professionals: a psychologist, a doctor, a nurse, a social worker, and a driver. According to Stanislav, for those who stay in shelters it is sometimes crucial just to have simple conversations with people, and medical examination may fade into the background., “I recall one elderly lady from a shelter in Zaporizhzhia. Her hypertension had worsened,” says Stanislav. “I asked her to measure her blood pressure regularly and record the findings in a notebook, I gave her my own. During her next appointment we arrived next time, I asked her to show me the notebook. She showed it and smiled – it was empty. She said that she had no time to care about health while the war is ongoing.”, “Marina works is a separate room designated for psychological counselling,” says Stanislav. “She sees paediatric patients with their parents and adults separately. I can see how women are coping despite all the hardships. They are hiding their problems behind a smile. Marina helps them to overcome these negative emotions.”, Before the war broke out, the exhibition centre and concert hall in Zaporizhzia was a popular place for people to visit. Now, it is one of the main places in the region where internally displaced people gather to get help. Stanislav has observed huge queues multiple times while passing by., “People have different needs and MSF psychologists like Marina provide what support they can. Some need to get papers done, some come here to get basic necessities,” he says. “There are some who don’t want something tangible, they want to talk and share what they’ve been through, and through talking try to heal themselves. They seek faith in some future and want to learn to make plans during the war.”, “Quite often we come across people in their 40s or 50s, who spent years working on careers saving up to buy homes for their families, only to see their homes destroyed and their life savings along with them,” says Gilles. “It’s hard to understand just how hard this is on people – we witness the destruction and the impact it has on people, but unless it happens to you, you’ll never really know what it’s like.”, MSF psychologists often say only families and children can keep these people strong. But despite this, they remain in shock. It is important to provide these patients with a comfortable place where they can share their emotions. The specialist will listen to them and offer methods for coping with stress, trauma, and losses., MSF staff, many of whom are displaced themselves also receive stress management training. MSF works in 36 shelters in Zaporizhzhia and 46 shelters in Dnipro.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/providing-care-displaced-people-dnipro-and-zaporizhzhia
UNDP signs MOU with Ministry of Social Policy to enhance and expand partnership [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,Recovery and Reconstruction,19 Oct 2022,"UNDP to develop, deliver and digitalize solutions to evolving social challenges in Ukraine, Kyiv, 19 October 2022 – The United Nations Development Programme today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine to strengthen and streamline the delivery of important social services to address the wide and evolving range of needs of the Ukrainian people. Within this partnership, UNDP agrees to help improve legislation and sectoral policy, strengthen expertise and technical support through the capacity development of public officials, and expand cooperation with social, rehabilitation and social-administrative service, including with civil society organizations., Interim UNDP Resident Representative Manal Fouani said that in times of war, it is all too easy for the most vulnerable in society to fall through the cracks and be left behind. “We will work with the Ministry to make sure this does not happen,” she said. “Our experts bring the collective experience from nearly 170 countries, which combined with the ministry’s knowledge and expertise, will collaboratively design the best possible solutions for the current context in Ukraine.”, Under the agreement and with financial support from the governments of Germany and Korea, UNDP will provide immediate support to analyse and address current gaps in rehabilitation and social care service provision and develop new policies and programmes to ensure early recovery in the sector. The organization will work closely with the ministry to digitalize services in the social sphere and work to increase the level of awareness among targeted populations about the use of digital services. UNDP recently developed 14 new digitized social services solutions, through which displaced Ukrainians can register for benefits and apply for housing subsidies and pensions., UNDP is currently working on 13 additional digital solutions, for example, for single parents applying for benefits, services for child adoption and applications for benefits for low-income families., The Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine, Oksana Zholnovych, noted the importance of strengthening cooperation between the ministry and UNDP under conditions of full-scale war, and setting out its goals formally in the Memorandum., “The full-scale war has created extraordinary challenges for the existing system of social services and support,” Zholnovych said. “We, as a state, must provide for the needs of the most vulnerable sections of the population – people with disabilities, single elderly persons, and other categories that find it difficult to evacuate abroad, or who don’t want to. Internally displaced persons among these categories of people find it practically impossible to receive social services in their new communities.”, “That’s why we have to think of mechanisms that can give them the required help. So it’s important for us to secure technical and legislative support, and to employ the best world practices in reformatting the social support system. I’m confident that the conclusion of the Memorandum with UNDP will greatly strengthen this process.”, The minister also stressed that new digital models of support in the social sphere that will emerge as a result of cooperation between the Ministry of Social Policy and UNDP in Ukraine will provide convenient and effective services for people, and in the future could even become an example for other countries., “To overcome difficult life circumstances, it is not enough to hand out money – it’s also very important to provide the required services,” Zholnovych said., “But often local communities don’t have enough specialists and funds for this. So the Ministry of Social Policy wants to use the experience of the healthcare system and set up the central procurement of social services from various providers, thus creating competition that will improve the quality of these services. We also plan to purchase social services from the NGOs that have the necessary experience and specialists.”, “This will allow us to create a single network of social service providers across the entire country."", Background: At the start of the war, the Government of Ukraine was forced to make quick and drastic policy decisions in the social sector, to make sure that the people of Ukraine received support, even if, sometimes, such a decision was not supported by all the necessary enablers. UNDP stepped up and provided the necessary IT hardware and other necessary infrastructure, along with training and logistical support., Media enquiries: Yuliia Samus, UNDP Ukraine Communication; e-mail: yuliia.samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/undp-signs-mou-ministry-social-policy-enhance-and-expand-partnership-enuk
Ukraine: Winter must not be used as a weapon of war,News and Press Release,NRC,"Protection and Human Rights
Water Sanitation Hygiene",20 Oct 2022,"Attacks on civilian infrastructure needed for water, electricity and heating is increasing humanitarian needs and could further displace thousands across Ukraine and into neighbouring countries this winter., “The recent escalation of attacks against civilians and infrastructure is leaving the most vulnerable in desperate conditions as winter starts to bite. As the weather worsens, people are going to face the desperate choice of staying where they are without basic needs or packing their bags and moving to somewhere else in Ukraine or into neighbouring countries,” said Carlo Gherardi, Regional Director for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) in Central and Eastern Europe., “Attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure must stop. Human suffering is being prolonged, and as temperatures continue to plummet, humanitarian needs will increase. All warring parties must respect international humanitarian law and ensure that civilian lives and civilian infrastructure are protected throughout this conflict. Winter must not be used as a weapon of war.”, According to Ukraine’s government, 30 per cent of its energy infrastructure has been hit since the intensified missile strikes since October 10, leading to electricity cuts and blackout plans., “We are still working with our partners to provide critical relief items to people living in active conflict areas in the east, but we are now seeing increasing needs across the country due to widespread infrastructure damage, and it will only get worse. There needs to be concerted and coordinated efforts across the humanitarian and development sector if we are to get people back to their homes safely and enable them to stay. We cannot work on effective solutions for supporting displaced people while these attacks continue,” said Gherardi., Lack of water, heat or shelter in Ukraine could force many to flee across the border into neighbouring Poland, Moldova and Romania, communities already hosting significant numbers of Ukrainian refugees, and themselves living through the European cost-of-living crisis., In Poland, it is estimated that the number of new refugees from Ukraine could range from 500,000 to 750,000 before the end of the year, with half remaining in Poland while others move onwards to other European countries., In Moldova 40,000 new refugee arrivals are expected over the winter, in addition to the 90,000 already present in a context where 70 per cent of refugees are hosted by local families. Whole community support is needed to upgrade poorly insulated houses and support access to heating systems and winter items. Temperatures are already below zero, placing the life of thousands of people at risk. Moldova is also dealing with 30 per cent inflation affecting the host community’s capacity to meet their own winter needs and to support refugees., Notes to editors:, Photos can be downloaded for free use here., Facts and figures:, As a result of widespread hostilities in Ukraine, millions of people have fled from their homes, including an estimated 6,975,000 displaced inside Ukraine and up to 7,643,944 people who have fled to neighbouring countries or further afield across Europe., In Poland, NRC works almost entirely through partners, with the exception of the East Warsaw transit site, which NRC has been directly managing since 1 October 2022. With national organisations, NRC is providing Education, Information, Counselling, Legal Aid and Multi-Purpose Cash Assistance (MPCA)., In Poland, gaps between the country’s social protection and refugee needs are massive with 30 per cent of refugees currently hosted by Polish families - a figure which is steadily decreasing as fatigue sets in. These households are also struggling with cost of living and spiking energy costs. There is a growing concern that introduction of fees for stays in collective shelters, which are used by the most vulnerable, combined with a general hosting fatigue, will further exacerbate the dire situation of thousand more refugees seeking refuge in Poland and could potentially put them at risk of homelessness., In Moldova, NRC is working with a range of national and local partners to provide winterisation assistance, including provision of bedding, mattresses, blankets, and warm clothes, as well as rapid insulation and improvements to winter proof homes. NRC teams in Romania will work through ADRA, a national partner organisation, to provide bedding and small items to refugees in collective shelters and for those living in host communities, in addition to provision of heaters to households in rented accommodation., In Ukraine, NRC has both direct implementation and is working with and through our national and local partners, such as Vostok SOS, SSS, Luhansk Association of Organisations of Persons with Disabilities, League of Business and Professional Women and R2P to provide emergency relief assistance and services. Our winter response will be focused towards internally displaced persons in collective shelters and people in remote or rural areas. Geographically, NRC will target winterisation assistance to the North (Chernihiv, Makhariv, Borodyanka), East (Kharkiv), West (Lviv, Ternopil), and South (Odessa, Mykolaiv) of Ukraine., For more information, please contact:, NRC global media hotline: media@nrc.no, +47 905 62329",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-winter-must-not-be-used-weapon-war
"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (8-14 October 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,20 Oct 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, amid the ongoing Russian military invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces targeted over a dozen of regions across Ukraine with missile and drone strikes. The attacks prompted a wave of solidarity protests across the region. Violence related to the invasion also continued to spill across the border into Russia. Ceasefire violations continued along the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact. A deadly shooting occurred outside an LGBT+ bar in Slovakia, triggering solidarity and pro-LGBT+ rallies in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Italy. Meanwhile, the death of Mahsa Amini and rising living costs continued to spark demonstrations across Europe., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. In the Donetsk region, where almost half of the country's political violence was recorded last week, Russian forces engaged in offensive operations in the direction of Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and Soledar (ISW, 8 October 2022). In the Luhansk region, Ukrainian forces continued counteroffensive operations in the direction of Kreminna and Svatove (ISW, 12 October 2022)., Meanwhile, suspected Ukrainian security services triggered an explosion on 8 October, which severely damaged the Kerch bridge connecting Russia with the occupied Crimean peninsula across the Kerch Strait. Four Russian civilians were reportedly killed in the explosion. The bridge is an important supply and logistics artery for Russian military operations in southern Ukraine (New York Times, 8 October 2022). The Russian anti-terrorism committee claims that the bomb was loaded onto a truck that drove across the bridge (Meduza, 8 October 2022). Some analysts suggest that this claim aims to reduce the responsibility of Russian authorities for preventing the attack, claiming instead that an air or maritime drone may have been involved, or explosives attached to the bottom of the bridge (Molfar, 11 October 2022)., On 10 October, Russian forces launched missile and drone strikes across Ukraine, hitting critical infrastructure and civilian buildings in over a dozen regions, including strikes in the cities of Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro, and Zaporizhia. As a result, at least 20 civilians were reportedly killed and 108 were wounded (Suspilne Media, 11 October 2022). The strikes destroyed 30% of all Ukrainian power stations, knocking out power in hundreds of areas across the country (Volodymyr Zelensky, 18 October 2022; Ukrinform, 11 October 2022). Additionally, at least a further 29 civilians were reportedly killed in Russian airstrikes and shelling of Zaporizhia on 9 and 14 October. Rallies in solidarity with Ukraine and condemning the Russian attacks were subsequently recorded in Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Kazakhstan, Moldova, North Macedonia, Poland, and the United Kingdom., In Russia, two military enlistment offices and one local administration building were set on fire last week in the Republic of Bashkortostan, Udmurt Republic, and the Chelyabinsk region. Attacks on military enlistment offices have increased since the announcement of a ""partial mobilization"" on 21 September. Separately, the governors of Kursk and Belgorod regions accused Ukrainian forces of over a dozen incidents of cross-border fire, which hit infrastructure in villages and reportedly killed a resident in Shebekino (Novaya Gazeta, 10 October 2022). This violence contributed to the 115% increase in violent events in Russia last week relative to the weekly average for the preceding month. ACLED's Conflict Change Map also warned of increased violence in the country during the preceding four weeks., Meanwhile, in Belarus, President Aleksandr Lukashenko announced the formation of a regional group of armed forces in cooperation with the Russian Armed Forces (RFE/RL, 14 October 2022; 16 October 2022). According to Ukrainian officials, the joint regional group is likely intended to consolidate Russia's military presence in Belarus and divert Ukrainian forces to the northern regions bordering Belarus (Financial Times, 13 October 2022)., Daily ceasefire violations continued along the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact. Additionally, three Azerbaijani civilians were wounded in landmine explosions in the Agdam and Fizui districts of Azerbaijan and one Armenian serviceman was reportedly killed in a landmine explosion in the Tavush region of Armenia., In Slovakia, two men were shot dead in a suspected hate crime outside an LGBT+ bar in Bratislava on 12 October. A woman was also injured in the attack. The shooter, whose body was later found with apparent self-inflicted gun wounds, had written anti-LGBT+ and antisemitic social media posts prior to the attack (BBC, 15 October 2022). On 14 October, thousands of people, including the president and prime minister, joined a protest in commemoration of the two victims and in support of LGBT+ rights (BBC, 15 October 2022). A solidarity demonstration was also held in the Czech Republic. Additionally, marches and gatherings to oppose discrimination against LGBT+ people were recorded in Italy, where recent general elections and the likely formation of a right/far-right governing coalition have raised concerns about the protection of LGBT+ rights (Euronews, 28 September 2022; La Stampa, 12 October 2022)., The death of Mahsa Amini in Iran continued to spark solidarity gatherings across Europe last week for a fourth consecutive week. Rallies in support of the ongoing protests and women's rights in Iran were observed in Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Kosovo, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. In Germany, police arrested two people during a demonstration in front of the Iranian Consulate General in Hamburg on 10 October, after participants threw eggs and stones at the premises. Meanwhile, on the night between 13 and 14 October, unknown perpetrators attempted to set fire to a school in Hamburg owned by the Iranian state., Demonstration activity linked to rising living costs, inflation, and energy prices continued across the region last week, with cross-sector protests recorded in Belgium, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Moldova, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In Germany, more than 35 'Monday Walks' -- a spontaneous form of protest that had previously been adopted to oppose COVID-19 restrictions and vaccine mandates -- were observed on 10 October, with participants calling for a shift in the government's energy policy. Several walks were organized by far-right parties (Tagesspiegel, 11 October 2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-8-14-october-2022
"Experts of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women Commend Ukraine for Achievements in Gender Equality, Raise Questions on Conflict-Based Sexual Violence",News and Press Release,CEDAW,Protection and Human Rights,19 Oct 2022,"The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women today concluded its consideration of the ninth periodic report of Ukraine, with Committee Experts commending the State on the measures it had taken to advance gender equality in the country, while asking questions about how Ukraine was addressing conflict-based sexual violence., Dalia Leinarte, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur for Ukraine, said the Committee fully recognised Ukraine’s efforts to have this constructive dialogue during the time of genocidal armed aggression against the State. Ms. Leinarte commended the Ukrainian Government for the achievements in gender equality which took place in the last few years in Ukraine, including the adoption of legal instruments to combat discrimination against women; the approval of the State Strategy on Equal Rights and Opportunities for Women and Men until 2030; and the establishment of mandatory gender quotas for national and regional electoral lists, among other measures., Ms. Leinarte questioned the delegation about who brought cases of rape and conflict-related sexual violence before the courts? Who was responsible for coordinating this process? Could the delegation elaborate on the concept of rape being used as a tool of war? The Committee believed that Ukraine would come out of the war offering gender-sensitive reparations for survivors of sexual assault, and would be able to bring perpetrators to justice., The delegation said despite the full-scale military invasion of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, cases relating to the conflict were investigated. Taking into account the vulnerability of survivors of such crimes, the Government was introducing a comprehensive approach into investigating these crimes, in conjunction with civil society. The Prosecutor’s office coordinated the investigation of such crimes. Sexual violence was indeed being used as a weapon in this war. All activities of the law enforcement system in Ukraine focused on documenting war crimes. There were many cases relating to the conflict related to sexual violence against civilians. Specialised police mobile units had been created to identify cases of sexual violence in de-occupied territories., Introducing the report, Oksana Zholnovych, Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine and Head of Delegation, said Ukraine's ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was the basis of strategic Ukrainian documents, including the National Strategy for Human Rights. Since the beginning of the year, 95 cases of human trafficking had been recorded, and in 2021, the Government had approved the concept of the programme for combatting trafficking in human beings. New challenges related to the war were being taken into account, as due to the mass exodus of women and children leaving Ukraine, the risk of them being trafficked and sexually exploited had increased significantly. Since the beginning of the war, cases of sexual violence against civilians by the Russian military had been recorded in Ukraine and sexual violence was used as an instrument of war., In concluding remarks, Kateryna Levchenko, Deputy Head of the Official Delegation of Ukraine, thanked the Committee Experts for their careful consideration of the report. Ukraine looked forward to the Committee’s concluding observations. However, due to the Russian aggression, Ukraine would rely heavily on the help of other countries and international organizations for assistance with implementation., Gladys Acosta Vargas, Committee Chairperson, thanked the delegation for the constructive dialogue with the Committee, which had provided further insight into the situation of women and girls in Ukraine, in light of the particularly difficult situation. Ms. Acosta Vargas commended Ukraine for its efforts and recommended that the State take measures to implement all recommendations of the Committee., The delegation of Ukraine consisted of representatives fromOpens in new window the Ministry of Social Policy; the Ministry of Economy; the Ministry of Education and Science; the Ministry of Reintegration; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Ministry of Health; the Ministry of Internal Affairs; the Ministry of Justice; the Ministry of Veteran Affairs for European Integration; the Office of the Prosecutor General; the Prime Minister’s Office for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration of Ukraine; the National Policy of Ukraine; the Department for the Protection of Children’s Rights and Ensuring Equality Standards of the National Social Service; the Government Commissioner for Gender Equality; and the Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the United Nations Office at Geneva., The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women’s eighty-third session is being held from 10 to 28 October. All the documents relating to the Committee’s work, including reports submitted by States parties, can be found on the session’s webpage. Meeting summary releases can be found here. The webcast of the Committee’s public meetings can be accessed via the UN Web TV webpage., The Committee will next meet in public at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 19 October, to conclude its review of the ninth period review of Honduras (CEDAW/C/HND/9)., Report, The Committee has before it the ninth periodic report of Ukraine (CEDAW/C/UKR/9)., Presentation of Report, OKSANA ZHOLNOVYCH, Minister of Social Policy of Ukraine and Head of Delegation,said Ukraine's ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was the basis of strategic Ukrainian documents, including the National Strategy for Human Rights. In August 2022, the Government approved the State Strategy for Ensuring Equal Rights and Opportunities for Women and Men until 2030. The Istanbul Convention was ratified in June this year, and in 2021 the Code of Ukraine on Administrative Offenses was amended; in particular, the legal regulation of holding responsible perpetrators of acts of domestic violence and gender-based violence. The integration of a gender-based approach into the activities of public authorities at all levels had become an integral part of the formation and implementation of people-centred policies., To overcome stereotypical ideas about women, special attention was paid to journalists, and well-known women and men were involved in information campaigns. Since the beginning of the year, 95 cases of human trafficking had been recorded, and in 2021, the Government approved the concept of the programme for combatting trafficking in human beings. New challenges related to the war were being taken into account, as due to the mass exodus of women and children leaving Ukraine, the risk of them being trafficked and sexually exploited had increased significantly., Children were given the opportunity to continue their studies in secondary education institutions with ensured security. But the reality was that 2,608 educational institutions had been bombed and shelled, with 313 destroyed. In 2021, the gender pay gap between men and women decreased by almost 3 per cent, compared to the previous year. National labour legislation was being improved to expand opportunities for women's employment, including women and girls in rural areas., Preventative programmes for sex workers were being introduced, and the HIV prevalence rate among sex workers had a steady downward trend at 3.1 per cent., In 2021, the reconstruction of 50 regional clinical healthcare facilities was launched, however due to the war, this programme was suspended. After the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, 1,076 medical institutions were damaged and 144 were completely destroyed., As of 30 September, compared to the beginning of the year, the number of registered internally displaced persons had increased almost three and a half times, to over 4.7 million people, with more than 60 per cent of these being women. Since the beginning of the war, cases of sexual violence against civilians by the Russian military had been recorded in Ukraine and sexual violence was used as an instrument of war. As of September 2022, law enforcement agencies had initiated 43 criminal proceedings on sexual violence committed during the armed conflict. One of the main tasks was to quickly adapt the violence response system to the special needs of victims of conflict-related sexual violence, to provide victims with a full range of assistance and services. In Ukraine, the network of specialised support services for victims of domestic violence and gender-based violence had been expanded, comprising of 431 mobile teams of social and psychological assistance, 43 shelters, and 37 daycentres of social and psychological assistance. In 2022, almost 15,000 people had used these services., Many women's initiatives had been implemented in the Zaporizhia region, including four humanitarian hubs, where women who temporarily left the occupied territorial communities were engaged in volunteer activities. More than 800 women had already used the services. Ms. Zholnovych emphasised that the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine had led to limited opportunities to meet basic needs and rights. Ukraine was grateful to all States for their support, and was confident that the dialogue with the Committee would contribute to the further advancement of Ukraine in the implementation of the Convention., VOLODYMYR DZHYDZHORA, Head of International Cooperation and European Integration Department of the Office of the Commissioner, Office of the Ukrainian Parliament Commissioner for Human Rights, said Ukraine had taken several measures to accelerate the elimination of discrimination against women and to empower women in various spheres. In recent years, much had been achieved, but despite positive changes, gender inequality still existed in many areas. During 2019-2021, 96 people appealed to the Ombudsman regarding discrimination on the basis of gender, and in 2022, 21 appeals on similar issues were received., The armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine had created new challenges, including displacement; loss of livelihoods; risks of conflict-related sexual violence; and risks of human trafficking. Law enforcement agencies of Ukraine were conducting pre-trial investigations in more than 40 criminal proceedings on sexually violent acts committed by Russian servicemen. Cases of conflict-related sexual violence were reported from the occupied and de-occupied territories of Ukraine, which predominantly affected women and girls. Ukraine was making efforts to regulate the State policy on the protection of victims and to bring the perpetrators to justice., Questions by Committee Experts, DALIA LEINARTE, Committee Expert and Country Rapporteur for Ukraine, said the Committee fully recognised Ukraine’s efforts to have this constructive dialogue during the time of genocidal armed aggression against the State. Ms. Leinarte commended the Ukrainian Government for the achievements in gender equality which took place in the last few years in Ukraine, including the adoption of legal instruments to combat discrimination against women; the approval of the State Strategy on Equal Rights and Opportunities for Women and Men until 2030; and the establishment of mandatory gender quotas for national and regional electoral lists, among other measures. Who brought cases of rape and conflict-related sexual violence before the courts? Who was responsible for coordinating this process? Could the delegation elaborate on the concept of rape being used as a tool of war? The Committee believed that Ukraine would come out of the war offering gender-sensitive reparations for survivors of sexual assault, and would be able to bring perpetrators to justice., A Committee Expert asked how equality, respect for women’s rights, and women’s leadership could be ensured as strategic priorities in the economic and political reconstruction? Only a specific, innovative mechanism that mobilised all international actors and covered all sectors of economic intervention and decision-making in all parts of the territory could help construct a new paradigm that made equality an active principle in the recovery of the country., Responses by the Delegation, The delegation said despite the full-scale military invasion of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, cases relating to the conflict were investigated. Patterns were emerging, where instances of conflict-related sexual violence were being recorded in Ukrainian territories where the Russian military controlled settlements. Taking into account the vulnerability of survivors of such crimes, the Government was introducing a comprehensive approach into investigating these crimes, in conjunction with civil society. The Prosecutor’s office coordinated the investigation of such crimes. The first task was to provide services to survivors, including a safe and secure place of residence, in case of returning Russian soldiers. The Government was initiating an awareness raising campaign, so that survivors were not afraid to reach out and ask for support. Sexual violence was indeed being used as a weapon in this war., All activities of the law enforcement system in Ukraine focused on documenting war crimes. There were many cases relating to the conflict related to sexual violence against civilians; 43 criminal proceedings had been carried out and among those there were cases that involved several survivors of cases of rape. Specialised police mobile units had been created to identify cases of sexual violence in de-occupied territories. Special leaflets had been distributed by the police to the civilian population, to encourage civilians to reach out for assistance and inform them of the services available. Trainings were conducted for law enforcement representatives to allow them to recognise cases of conflict-related sexual violence. The delegation said a holistic approach was being offered to victims of conflict related sexual violence, as well as access to justice. In May this year, the Government signed a framework with the United Nations on the prevention of conflict-related sexual violence, and had developed a plan to implement the framework, in conjunction with international partners., Ukraine had created a network of centres for survivors of conflict-related sexual violence, which were opened in strategically important cities of Ukraine. They had become a hub for survivors in many areas where people were forcibly displaced. The centres took into account the key provisions of the Istanbul Convention, including confidentiality of information and consent. The centres were created to help survivors to start a new chapter in their life, and offer them all services such as psychological help and social benefits, all in one place. Four centres had already opened, but this was just a beginning, with a holistic network of centres planned to open all over Ukraine., The Government had signed a memorandum of cooperation with two key civil society organizations, and had started the procedure for providing temporary reparation to survivors of conflict-related sexual violence. Ukraine had created an expert gender group, consisting of more than 40 experts, and 24 working groups contributed to the recovery plan. Gender briefings had been prepared on the recovery of Ukraine, and gender equality and inclusiveness were seen as a key principle within the recovery plan., Questions by Committee Experts, A Committee Expert said the Committee appreciated all efforts made in strengthening the political machinery since the last discussion. The Committee would like to support Ukraine in the implementation of this policy machinery, which was slow. How did Ukraine ensure that decentralisation did not impede access to basic services? What was being done to overcome patriarchal attitudes? How did Ukraine expect to address the regions which did not have gender-specific approaches?, One Committee Expert thanked Ukraine for taking part in the important dialogue at such a critical time. Some key measures had already been introduced which deserved recognition, including the amendment of the law on social services in April 2022, extending the categories of people who could receive services. Would Ukraine consider introducing further temporary special measures to increase the number of women elected to political positions? What was being done to increase the participation of minority women? Would the State consider temporary special measures to increase the number of women involved in negotiations and the peace process? What did Ukraine need assistance with now? Were measures in place to increase rehabilitation services for victims of the conflict? Would measures be implemented to mitigate situations when women and girls had been issued Russian passports against their will?, Responses by the Delegation, The delegation said indicators were applied to see how the situation in Ukraine was changing, and how the State should react. Guidelines were provided on communication channels, which were critical for providing citizens with the services they needed. In difficult war time, there were two types of working people: those on the front line, and those on the economic front. The First Lady had initiated a national programme of psychosocial support, which coordinated civil society, United Nations agencies and other partners. The stress caused by daily bombings meant most Ukrainians required psychological support., Civil society organizations and non-governmental organizations were involved in all aspects of ensuring gender equality throughout the country. A new information platform had been created which highlighted all the changes in gender equality which had been made in everyday life. The national strategy of regional development included all questions relating to ensuring equal rights and opportunities at the regional level, and provided the key components of regional plans. Gender equality was reflected in the plan in all areas of life. More than 4.7 million people were internally displaced, with 60 per cent of these being women, and 22 per cent children. Legal aid, educational aid and temporary residence was provided to these people and financial aid was provided to families., Women who did not have documents certifying their identity or Ukrainian citizenship would be provided with the right to receive free secondary legal aid, allowing documents to be issued in a court order. More than 3,000 victims of human trafficking received information regarding their rights, and protection mechanisms. The issue of Ukrainian citizens who had received Russian passports was a completely new challenge. The Government was trying to tackle such cases, however, a comprehensive procedure to determine how these people received a Russian passport needed to be developed. The capacity of the actors who provided assistance to survivors of conflict-related sexual violence needed to be developed., Questions by Committee Experts, A Committee Expert asked if there was a possibility that a Russian soldier who had violated women’s rights could never be exchanged during a prisoner exchange? This may be a good preventative measure. Would the State consider implementing this policy?, One Committee Expert asked if the Government policy for gender equality could become fully functioning within the legislation?, Another Committee Expert asked about the challenges faced by mobile centres? Did they cover all of Ukraine? How would their work be expanded? Did civil society assist in providing psychosocial support for survivors? What were the State party’s plans to enact the draft law for strengthening the protection of women victims of conflict-related violence? What were the key findings on the study on the situation of female military personnel? Were there strategies to support women’s leading and shifting role throughout the present conflict? How would the action plan on gender equality be implemented?, A Committee Expert asked what measures would be taken to bring in line with international standards effective access to justice, and to ensure access to crisis centres? Would support be increased for women victims of violence and other vulnerable women? How would data collection be enhanced?, Another Committee Expert said the Government had a sponsored hotline dedicated to trafficking; was this still in operation? Some information received estimated that around 10 to 15 per cent of Roma lacked identification documents and were therefore vulnerable to trafficking. Would the Roma population be looked after when it came to registration? An estimated 104,000 were in State-run orphanages and at high risk of trafficking. How did the State envisage protecting them? There were situations where men pressured women with disabilities to marry them, to enable them to leave Ukraine. It was hoped that the authorities were dealing with these cases. The implementation of trafficking programmes required the attention of the Government. How would women at risk of prostitution be protected? Would the draft recovery plan have a section concerning trafficking?, Responses by the Delegation, The delegation said tackling domestic violence was a priority before the war. Additional analysis was needed, as the recording of domestic violence cases had decreased due to the conflict. In 2022, Ukraine adopted recommendations about discrimination in the military service and armed forces. There were around 5,000 women at the frontline, and 50,000 women working at different positions in the army. Increasing the ability of the defence sector to react to discrimination was a key priority of the Government. Support for women victims of violence was provided in the form of crisis rooms and hotlines, and was funded at a State and local level. Several hotlines were in operation and were being administered by the Government. There were also hotlines coordinated by non-governmental organizations. There were four national hotlines and 21 regional hotlines to combat domestic violence and support survivors. An audit of the hotlines had been conducted in September this year., The Ministry of Social Policy had created an inter-agency group to tackle the issues which arose during the implementation of the State’s policies. Newsletters and text messages were sent to those who had fled Ukraine to abroad, and a website had been developed on safety and security for women and girls who moved abroad. Amendments had been introduced to enhance the draft law on the protection of women in conflict, which was the reason for its delay. Measures had been introduced to support those in occupied territories and help those in areas of active hostilities. A survey had been carried out which showed that the level of awareness of the population in how to treat an unattended object in public spaces was low, particularly among women. This needed to be addressed. However, the level awareness of the public was now much higher, due to the conflict. New reports relating to the Istanbul Convention were being developed, including on the topics of domestic violence and sexual violence., The delegation said there was a serious number of laws and bylaws which needed to be amended, when it came to countering sexual violence and human trafficking. The Committee needed to pay attention to this particular issue, as there was ongoing exploitation of Ukrainians in many countries in the European Union. A platform called Aurora had been created, providing the opportunity for psychological and psychotherapy anonymous assistance. There were more than 22,000 job openings in Ukraine, and each of them would be reviewed to ensure no discrimination. There were around 12,000 orphans who were living abroad due to the conflict, and around 6,000 had relocated with foster families. In some cases, entire institutions had been evacuated. Concerning information had been received about children abroad, including risks of trafficking. The adoption of Ukrainian children had been suspended to mitigate these risks., Questions by Committee Experts, A Committee Expert asked about the draft recovery plan; was the crime of trafficking included within the 24 points? Had the amendments to the draft law on human trafficking, made in 2021, been accepted yet?, One Committee Expert welcomed Ukraine’s efforts to ensure gender equality despite the aggression caused by the Russian Federation. It was hoped that after the war Ukraine would set an example in parity and equality in decision making. Representation of women in high-ranking positions remained low, despite their vital role in all stages of the conflict and peace building, representing 27 per cent in the public service. What strategies were in place to intensify efforts to increase women’s representation in leadership roles, in parliament and public administrations? What strategies were in place to increase women’s participation in the diplomatic service? What protective strategies were in place for women politicians to prevent sexist attacks?, A Committee Expert said since 24 February, more than 9 million citizens had left Ukraine. This had resulted in issues for citizenship for women, girls and children who had fled the territory and for those born abroad. How was the State solving the problems of registration of births of children abroad?, Responses by the Delegation, The delegation said the draft law on human trafficking provided some amendments of the system in dealing with trafficking and gave the local bodies more authority. Draft legislation had been developed on prostitution to identify the needs of those involved and develop a roadmap to help them stop prostitution and reintegrate in society. By the end of 2021, women’s representation was 29 per cent in high-level positions; as of July 2022, 32 per cent of women were holding high-level positions. The number of women in managerial positions was increasing constantly. The largest number of women was represented in the State migration service, where women held 80 per cent of positions. Twenty-eight per cent of the positions in the national police of Ukraine were held by women. The number of women within the diplomatic service and in ambassador posts was increasing constantly; 40 per cent of roles in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were held by women. A strategy had been implemented to increase the representation of women in the Government through measures, which included providing mentorship for women, and encouraging men to take leave to care for their children. Despite the situation of war, Ukraine would continue to implement these measures., Employees were given compensation from the Government for hiring internally displaced persons. Amendments had been made to the Labour Code, ensuring 30 per cent of women would be represented in political parties. Training and workshops were organised for women with disabilities, to ensure they could take an active part in decision making at the local and regional levels. Simplified court procedures were in place for conducting birth registration in the occupied territories. In an app, there was a section for children, which let parents submit an application to receive a birth certificate. A list of documents needed to be submitted electronically, whether the persons were in Ukraine or abroad. Roma could also use this app. Parents of children born in the occupied territories did not pay State fees for registration. The procedure had been simplified to make the process easier for these people who were already facing immense challenges. Sixteen training programmes had been developed for civil servants, and more than 3,500 civil servants underwent these trainings each year. Around 90 per cent of participants in the training programmes were women., Questions by Committee Experts, A Committee Expert asked if Ukraine had ever had a Minister of Defence who was a woman? Were women working in all branches of the armed forces of Ukraine, including the navy and air force? What was their percentage compared to male officers? Were there female military attaches in embassies abroad?, One Committee Expert asked if Ukraine had changed the legislation for the procedure of getting citizenship for children who had not been born in Ukraine? What was being done to assist Roma born on Ukrainian territories who had difficulty accessing birth registration documents?, Responses by the Delegation, The delegation said female participation was very important in the defence sectors. There were several women who had achieved the highest official general ranking over the past few years, including those in the Ukrainian armed forces. There had been no women who had held the role of Minister of Defence, but there had been female Deputy Ministers. There was also a female Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs. The number of women at all levels in the security and defence sector was increasing. There were 38,000 women in the Ukrainian armed forces., The Ministry of Justice was in charge of issuing birth certificates. A simplified procedure was in place, established by the courts, so there were no big efforts needed from the person trying to obtain the birth certificate. Awareness raising campaigns were conducted among the Roma people to provide information on how children’s births could be registered. Russian occupiers had currently blocked citizens of Ukraine in occupied areas to go to government-controlled areas, which created issues and prevented them from receiving government services., Questions by Committee Experts, A Committee Expert commended Ukraine for policies on aligning educational material with the Convention and the laws of Ukraine. Since 2013, there had been a decline in the State spending on education; this had caused a reduction of teaching staff and a closure of teaching facilities. Had 2,500 schools been earmarked for closure, due to low number of pupils? How many of these schools had been closed? What were the number of schools damaged by the conflict? With the number of schools closed and the unreliable Internet, how had the digital divide been addressed? What had been done about the training of counsellors in schools, to assist with mitigating the psychological impacts of the conflict? How would the Government make up the learning time lost by children due to the conflict? Were there steps to address the detrimental impact of the conflict on girls’ education? What measures were being carried out to improve access to education for girls from minority groups, and combat prejudice against them?, Responses by the Delegation, The delegation said the Ukrainian educational system continued to function throughout the war. Education had been continuing in a hybrid format, and face to face in safe areas of Ukraine; 177 schools had been completely destroyed and over 1,000 schools had considerable damage; 17 universities had been destroyed and 51 had considerable destruction which meant study at these institutions could not continue. The First Lady had launched a mental health initiative which saw 25,000 school psychologists mobilised to work with students and teachers who had faced difficulties during war time. In the territories liberated from Russian aggression, education continued. Around 95 per cent of Ukrainian children were connected to the education system online. Schools which had a low number of children were optimised., There had been a complete audit of schools up to 2022 to check their safety. More than 65 per cent of schools were equipped with bomb shelters where students and teachers could stay during air raids. Members of the State Emergency Department of Ukraine were invited to schools to explain to children how they should behave in situations of danger. Methods were in place to prevent bullying, including punishment via a fee, and community service. There was a focus on the early development of Roma children, where experts visited schools and shared best practices for different regions. A strategy had been approved which related to all levels of education, and all principles were based on non-discrimination, using the Convention as a basis. There were no restrictions for girls when it came to studying., The level of digitisation in Ukraine was very high and there was a highly developed network of libraries in rural areas, which were used to develop the digital literacy of the population. A “no barriers” strategy had been adopted which aimed to help people of any gender, age or with disabilities to use services in all areas of daily life, to have access to education and to have access to decision making. Audits were conducted for educational establishments, and a special methodology had been developed to analyse the inclusivity of all educational establishments., Questions by Committee Experts, A Committee Expert asked about completion rates and cohort analysis? Revisions of history books needed to be taken into account regarding the roles that women played., One Committee Expert commended the State party for several amendments to the Labour Code. However, women continued to be segregated in low-income sectors, and they had been affected by high job losses. Would the State party consider a national recovery plan which would address the root causes of gender stereotypes and discrimination, with a laser focused attention on gender equality? A study conducted by the Government had identified women with family responsibilities and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex persons as the most vulnerable in the workplace. How would the State party use these findings to improve the situation of vulnerable women in the labour market, including those who used drugs? A large pay gap between men and women still existed; women’s salaries were on average 20 per cent lower than men for the same activities. What would a post-conflict Ukraine look like for women regarding equal pay? What steps would the State party take to reduce the wage gap between women and men? What would be done to improve the employment levels of vulnerable women post conflict?, Responses by the Delegation, The delegation said the wage gap had been reduced to around 18 per cent in 2022, with the aim to reduce this further. There would be a procedure within the courts to protect women who received a salary lower than their male counterparts who held the same position. In 2021, legislative amendments had been adopted to allow both mothers and fathers to take parental leave, even if they were not married. Employers were given incentives for employing those from minority groups, such as single mothers and women with disabilities. The current legislation prohibited women from working at night. The Government was working to bring legislation in line with the principles of the Convention. Gender audits were carried out in organizations to allow the Government to evaluate the conditions created for women, and observe what anti-discrimination norms were in place., Within the past three years, many legal acts in Ukraine had been amended with provisions on the non-acceptability of sexual harassment in the workplace. These amendments had resulted in mechanisms in place to respond to instances of sexual harassment. Among the priorities was promoting science, technology, engineering and math education which corresponded to the economic development of Ukrainian society., Questions and Responses, A Committee Expert asked if women led labour unions in Ukraine? What programmes were in place to encourage women to become leaders of labour unions?, One Committee Expert asked about allegations of women having to submit resignation letters when they were hired with open dates, in case they became pregnant?, The delegation said there were stereotypes of pregnant women and those with young children; however, the new labour law, which would come into force in March 2023, hoped to tackle these stereotypes. All social partners, the Government, and representatives of professional unions, were part of the international coalition on reducing the gender pay gap. The access of women to science, technology, engineering and math professions was being broadened., A Committee Expert said that in terms of sexual and reproductive health, and given the current situation, how were women receiving contraception? How were they receiving health care and treatments? Could the delegation explain about women who had been raped and about rape being used as a weapon of war?, The delegation said the Russian aggression was not just a conflict but a genocide against the Ukrainian people, with civilians, including pregnant women, being killed. Around 1,000 civilian women had been seriously wounded and were being treated in Ukraine and abroad. The healthcare system in Ukraine was a united front which helped Ukraine continue its fight for liberty. There were medical packages available for women who had just given birth and other health care packages were available which guaranteed free medical aid to citizens. In 2022, Ukraine had allocated 157 billion krona to provide access to medical care. As a result of the military aggression, 176 health facilities had been damaged, including 18 maternity wards, which made it difficult to provide healthcare. Thanks to international partners, there were mobile maternity teams which had been deployed. A huge problem had been experienced with the logistics of drugs for treating oncology patients., An emergency reaction system had been created which had allowed around 2,000 people who were wounded and with chronic diseases to be evacuated from hospitals, and received by clinics abroad. Ukraine was very grateful to international partners for this support. Taking into consideration the huge problem that the war was having on the mental health of the population, it was expected that the majority of citizens would need some kind of psychological support., Questions by Committee Experts, A Committee Expert said a large part of the population was threatened, and it was satisfactory that the Government had been able to provide social benefits to families and refugees through innovative solutions. Could the delegation confirm that most women who should receive this social benefit had actually received it? How did the delegation see the future of social benefits and aid provided to families, in light of the precarious situation of the population? How did the State plan to help people, especially women refugees, as they returned to Ukraine? Could clarification be provided on women in occupied areas, who were without the resources they needed? Was there a targeted action for women to be able to create businesses, including micro businesses?, Responses by the Delegation, The delegation said there was currently a massive air raid in Kyiv, and the delegates online had to go to the shelter, which meant they may not be able to participate in answering the questions. An international tribunal needed to be created to deal with the crimes against humanity. Over 6.4 million Ukrainian refugees had been relocated. Ukraine would bring back the people who had been forced to move when it was safe. Legislation had been amended to increase social support, including the baby package distributed to young parents when a baby was born. Parents now did not just receive a package which contained clothes and baby materials, but also received financial compensation., Since September 2022, an agreement had been ratified with a German bank regarding mortgage benefits, which would be provided to those who had been selected through a lottery. Around 500 internally displaced persons had been selected for receiving these mortgage benefits, and more than 500 loan agreements had been signed., Questions and Responses, A Committee Expert asked what measures had been undertaken to increase accessibility to social services for persons with disabilities in rural areas, particularly women? Were public services and high-quality medical assistance provided in rural areas?, The delegation said women made up 52 per cent of the rural population in Ukraine. Single, elderly women were very vulnerable and almost 48 per cent of them lived in rural areas. Social services, legal aid and employment services taking into account age, disability and any other conditions were offered to rural women, and were included in strategic documents. Ukraine had a programme called “affordable loans” and the Government had amended regulations on State support for entrepreneurs, to support agricultural producers in obtaining affordable loans. It was important to provide funding to business entities which were working to counter the Russian aggression., The delegation said there were areas in Ukraine which were quite remote, and support was in place to assist facilities in these areas. Mobile teams visited rural areas and provided specialised help. The key priority was to ensure that the remote villages had a network of primary medical care with outpatient facilities. It was important that the people living in these areas had access to key medicines, which could prevent chronic disease., A Committee Expert said the biggest issue in Ukraine was related to housing: around 60 per cent of internally displaced persons lived in one room shared by multiple families. What vision did the Government have to help internally displaced people in these terrible situations?, The delegation said internally displaced persons lived in difficult situations, but this was war. The delegation was under the impression that the Committee did not understand the situation the people in Ukraine were living in. People were being shelled all the time and there were limited resources; this needed to be taken into account. It was unknown how long the genocide would continue. It was vital for international organizations to support Ukraine as it was difficult to restore everything that had been destroyed. There were thousands of hectares of land which were now filled with mines. A lot of resources were required. The State would do its best to include gender equality in all the reconstruction programmes. Internally displaced persons had been living in schools; however, the State did everything possible to provide them with accommodation in houses and apartments., Questions by a Committee Expert, A Committee Expert asked what steps had been undertaken to prevent child marriage and its harmful consequences? What legal safeguards had been adopted by the State party to protect women with disabilities from forced marriage? What legislation had been enacted so that gender-based violence against women was taken into account in judicial decisions on custody? What precautionary measures would be taken to prevent children with violent fathers from being taken out of the country without their mothers’ consent? Could the delegation report on measures to provide support to mothers instead of separating them from their children? What legal safeguards were in place to ensure women were totally free and were not subject to trafficking with respect to surrogacy? What measures had the State taken to prevent the neglect of institutionalised children? What measures were offered to parents so they could regain custody of their children? What measures had been taken to provide adequate social protection to widows from the war?, Responses by the Delegation, The delegation said the evacuation of children who were in institutions to safe areas had been ongoing since 24 February. Children who had lost their parents could be taken in by relatives or friends, as well as foster families. A person who was 16 years or older could be granted the right to marry if it was in their best interest. Such cases included pregnancy, or having given birth to a child. The number of marriages before 18 was decreasing every year; from 756 in 2020 to only 324 in 2022. Up to 15 per cent of applications to the judiciary for early marriage were rejected. A draft law had been developed which addressed supportive reproductive technologies, with articles relating to women who wanted to become surrogate mothers. People who had a criminal record were unable to be guardians of a child. There were twice as many cases of trafficking in relation to surrogacy, compared to the previous year., Closing Remarks, KATERYNA LEVCHENKO, Deputy Head of the Official Delegation of Ukraine, thanked the Committee Experts for their careful consideration of the report, which would help the Government of Ukraine continue protecting women's rights and advancing gender equality. Ukraine had been facing many challenges since 2014, the year that marked the beginning of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine. Ms. Levchenko looked forward to the Committee’s concluding observations. However, due to the Russian aggression, Ukraine would rely heavily on the help of other countries and international organizations for assistance with implementation., GLADYS ACOSTA VARGAS, Committee Chairperson, thanked the delegation for the constructive dialogue with the Committee, which had provided further insight into the situation of women and girls in Ukraine, in light of the particularly difficult situation. Ms. Acosta Vargas commended Ukraine for its efforts and recommended that the State take measures to implement all recommendations of the Committee, for the benefit of all women and girls in the country., Produced by the United Nations Information Service in Geneva for use of the information media; not an official record.

"Ukraine, where sirens sound day and night: A focus on persons with disabilities and provision of emergency health services",Analysis,HI,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",7 Oct 2022,"New report: People with disabilities in Ukraine facing multiple threats, People with disabilities and older people in Ukraine are facing multiple protection threats, according to a new report from Humanity & Inclusion. Published today, the report includes alarming accounts from Humanity & Inclusion’s Ukraine teams, who are witnessing people with disabilities being disproportionately exposed to violence and abuse and having greater difficulty accessing humanitarian aid and the services they need., People with disabilities and older people in Ukraine are at direct risk of abandonment, violence, injury and death. Due to all the dangers and challenges of living in a war zone, caregivers of older people and family members with disabilities are making impossible decisions between fleeing and staying to care for their family members., Some of the situations witnessed by Humanity & Inclusion’s teams in Ukraine include:, People with disabilities who are unable to move or are confined to their beds are being left behind due to a lack of evacuation support. Many people with disabilities don’t even have access to information on how to evacuate., Most of the bomb shelters are not accessible to people who use wheelchairs or have restricted mobility. Consequently, people with disabilities are left behind and are dangerously exposed to explosive weapon attacks., Those people with disabilities who are able to flee the violence are particularly vulnerable during the mass movement and displacement of civilians. In the rush to escape, they may lose contact with relatives and caretakers and lose their identification papers. And once they arrive at one of the “collective centers” (schools, gymnasiums etc.) for internally displaced people, people with disabilities often lack the privacy they need for getting dressed or personal hygiene care, exposing them to a high risk of abuse (violence, sexual violence, robbery, etc.), People with disabilities and older people are arriving at the borders in very poor condition and there is inadequate provision at the borders for people with disabilities, “In situations of war there are huge changes which can have a significant impact on older people. They are exposed to highly distressing events, often where they had to be urgently evacuated from their homes. In cases of limited mobility, people are sometimes put in blankets to evacuate because they cannot walk on their own*. When we go to geriatric collective centers, we see some people in their beds crying due to the high level of distress. What they really need is human connection**. They have lost all their community support, which is one of the biggest risk factors of displacement.”
*Caglar Tahiroglu, Humanity & Inclusion mental health and psychosocial support specialist in Ukraine., Institutions operating at triple capacity, The most recent data indicate that people with disabilities, older and chronically ill people make up a high proportion of those who are internally displaced. The most recent data from the International Organization for Migration estimates that 25% of internally displaced families in Ukraine include at least one family member with a disability, 36% include a chronically ill person and 46% a person over 60.In the central and western parts of Ukraine, institutions hosting older people or children with disabilities are often operating at double or triple their capacity. Various reports show children with disabilities to be living in horrendous conditions in some institutions. Humanity & Inclusion staff have witnessed overcrowding, poor hygiene and a lack of technical skills and care in these centers, as well as a loss of contact between the children and their families. These children are also in danger of being abandoned entirely, as many of the center staff have evacuated with their families., “The medical doctor had a call from the East telling him that they needed to evacuate 42 children with severe disabilities because of the bombardments in the region. The children were put in a bus and arrived in ten hours. This is how little time the center had to prepare for the arrival of these children and we are talking about children with very specific needs. When we saw the needs in the institution, the priority was to save lives with an emergency response. As Humanity & Inclusion, we do not usually work in institutions because, of course, we support a more inclusive approach and the inclusion of persons with disabilities into the community. But this is a war situation. When we entered the institution and saw the state of the children and the staff, with all the team we were clear we had to do something.”
Caglar Tahiroglu, Emergency Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Manager, Humanity & Inclusion Ukraine, Critical lack of rehabilitation and mental health services, Based on Humanity & Inclusion's experience in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, we know that the number of people with disabilities in Ukraine will increase due to injuries caused by explosive and armed violence. Bombing and shelling cause complex injuries that can lead to amputations or permanent disabilities, requiring long-term rehabilitation care. It is crucial to develop health services adapted to people living with disabilities., Currently, health services in Ukraine lack rehabilitation capacity. Hospitals are overrun and, in order to cope, they need to shorten the length of stays and are discharging people early. There has been a huge increase in demand for prosthetics & orthotics and rehabilitation services, and there are challenges with under-staffing, inconsistent referral systems and weak data management., “By providing early rehabilitation, our goal is to prevent further complications. Any one injury will always come with a list of potential problems. So, when you have multiple injuries, they each have their own risks that affect recovery. There is great value in getting people to move safely. It doesn’t take long for the body to start deteriorating, and then recovery can be quite difficult.”
Gaëlle Smith, Humanity & Inclusion emergency rehabilitation specialist, Trauma and mental health problems are among the primary healthcare risks in Ukraine as the population is witnessing highly traumatic events. But despite the huge demand for mental health and psychosocial support there is limited access, due to the high cost and limited availability of services. Humanity & Inclusion teams are also observing strong signs of distress from staff working in hospitals and collective centers due to overwork, the increasing number of people in need, and the lack of resources., Humanity & Inclusion in Ukraine, Humanity & Inclusion teams in Ukraine are working to support the people most affected by the conflict, including injured people, people with disabilities, older people and those with chronic illnesses. Our activities include emergency rehabilitation care, mental health and psychological support, and risk education sessions to prevent accidents with explosive ordnance., Overall, teams work to reduce the suffering of conflict-affected populations experiencing the most vulnerability, by delivering an inclusive, immediate and multisectoral humanitarian response. Operations address the protection, health, and basic needs of conflict-affected populations, while reducing the risks caused by explosive ordnance contamination,
facilitating the delivery of aid in Ukraine, and supporting the wider humanitarian response in becoming more inclusive. HI specifically focuses on internally displaced persons, refugees, persons with disabilities, as well as persons with injuries and those with signs of psychological distress. In Ukraine, Humanity & Inclusion works in the eastern and western parts of the country, constantly adapting its approach to the changing context, and in Moldova, in line with the Ukraine Flash Appeal and the Refugee Response Plan., Notes, Interviews available with Humanity & Inclusion experts in Ukraine, Published on October 7, Humanity & Inclusion’s new report “War in Ukraine: A focus on people with disabilities and the provision of emergency health services” paints a harrowing picture of the situation for people with disabilities living in the war-torn country. The report is based on data reviews and first-hand observations from Humanity & Inclusion’s teams on the ground who are witnessing people with disabilities being disproportionately exposed to violence and abuse and having more difficulties accessing humanitarian aid and the services they need., Media Contact",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-where-sirens-sound-day-and-night-focus-persons-disabilities-and-provision-emergency-health-services

Furthermore, the Commission will provide an additional €175 million in humanitarian assistance to support those most in need in Ukraine and Moldova., The announcement comes as Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, is visiting Ukraine today to help coordinate one of the EU's most extensive emergency response operations. During his visit, he met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well as the Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, Olga Stefanishyna, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dmytro Kuleba, the Minister of Internal Affairs, Mr Denys Monastyrsky, and Minister for Communities and Territories, Oleksiy Chernyshov., Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič said: “While Russia is further escalating its brutal attacks against Ukraine, specifically targeting civilian infrastructure and residential buildings, I stand here in Kyiv reiterating that the EU is as dedicated as ever in its support to Ukraine. The upcoming winter is likely to bring major challenges to Ukraine and we must be prepared. Via our rescEU reserve, a temporary shelter capacity will be immediately deployed to three different regions in Ukraine: Rivne, Bucha and Kharkiv. In addition, the EU is boosting its humanitarian aid funding with further a €175 million to provide education, food, access to water, and protection from the cold winter for the most vulnerable. We are also working together by preparing a pathway for Ukraine to join the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.”, EU humanitarian response this winter will include:, The rescEU strategic reserve will be mobilised to deploy emergency stockpiles of shelter units and other items to Ukraine with a total value of €62.3 million. Overall, together with a second shelter reserve hosted by Romania, the EU has acquired the capacity to provide temporary emergency shelter for up to 46,000 people., An additional €175 million[1] in humanitarian aid will target the most vulnerable in ukraine. Out of this, €150 milion is allocated for operations in Ukraine, while €25 million is for operations in Moldova. The key priority is to provide winterised shelter in view of the expected freezing temperatures. Other priorities include education in emergencies, health, and protection assistance. This new funding will bring the total of EU humanitarian aid in response to Russia's war in Ukraine to over €500 million., The European Commission and Ukraine have also started to work together to prepare Ukraine to join the EU Civil Protection Mechanism in the future. The Mechanism has already been mobilised in its full force to support Ukraine with more than 70,000 tonnes of life-saving items delivered to Ukraine from 31 different European countries., Background, In response to the Russia's military aggression against Ukraine in February 2022, the European Commission is coordinating its largest ever operation under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. All 27 EU countries, plus Norway, Türkiye, North Macedonia and Iceland, have offered in-kind assistance ranging from medical supplies and shelter items to vehicles and energy equipment. Since 24 February, the European Commission has allocated €523 million for humanitarian aid programmes to help civilians affected by the war in Ukraine. This includes respectively €485 million for Ukraine and €38 million for Moldova., To further strengthen its emergency response, the EU is developing its own shelter reserves that can be deployed in the context of crises or disasters., As a first pilot, the EU is in the process of deploying 500 temporary shelter units to the Rivne region, 550 to the Bucha region – in addition to 1000 beds - and 600 to the Kharkiv region in Ukraine. Each unit can host up to five people and is fully equipped with beds and heaters. The units are being shipped to Ukraine from the rescEU emergency stockpile hosted by Sweden., This emergency shelter reserve includes temporary housing units that will be equipped with showers, toilets, basic toiletry kits, and communal spaces for gathering or eating. The Commission has also procured thousands of beds that can be used in temporary accommodation centres to welcome refugees or internally displaced persons. The shelter units are being provided as a temporary solution, while more permanent housing is being made available.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-eu-launches-winter-shelter-programme-and-boosts-humanitarian-aid-eu175-million

Shelter and Non-Food Items",19 Oct 2022,"Context, Since the start of the Russian invasion on the 24th of February 2022, Izium City (48,000 inhabitants), a settlement in the south-eastern part of Kharkivska oblast, has suffered numerous damages to facilities and infrastructure. The most intensive destructions were caused during on-the-ground battles in March., Ukraine regained control over Izium City in the beginning of September 2022. Local authorities reported that 80% of local buildings were damaged. Such damage to utilities and infrastructure might indicate challenges to sustain heating supply in the city during the approaching winter. Any damage to apartments and apartment blocks is likely to further expose residents to harsh weather conditions., To support the humanitarian response, IMPACT Initiatives has conducted a residential damage analysis to estimate the number of affected residents in Izium City. The analysis is based on recent high-resolution satellite imagery (acquired on 29 August, 2022) and follows a similar approach as the one used for the Irpin City damage assessment conducted in July 2022.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-residential-building-damage-assessment-izium-kharkivska-oblast-february-august-2022
UNDP and EIB equip a new air-raid shelter in Odesa [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",19 Oct 2022,"New facility can provide shelter and sustenance for 500 people, Odesa, 19 October 2022 – The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine, with the financial support of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and in partnership with the Odesa City Council, this week opened a renovated and equipped shelter in the city of Odesa. The city, which has sheltered more than 85,000 internally displaced persons from southern and eastern Ukraine, is often a target of missiles and drones., Jean-Erik de Zagon, Head of the Resident Representation of the European Investment Bank to Ukraine, said the EIB, as the EU Bank, is working to ensure the support stays flexible to the needs of Ukrainians. “We are doing everything we can to strengthen the response to emergencies in Ukraine. EIB has already disbursed over €1.7 billion to Ukraine since 24 February to help the government meet most immediate and urgent financial needs. And we want and we will do more. I am glad that together with UNDP and thanks to our Ukraine Recovery Programme we can also contribute to security for Odesa residents and ensure unhindered access to equipped shelters in the event of an escalation.”, The city of Odesa and the surrounding territories have repeatedly become the object of shelling and airstrikes since the full-scale invasion started in February. Most of the shelters are simple and insufficient, such as building basements and underground parking lots. They often do not have additional evacuation exits, nor potable water supplies and drainage systems, are not adapted for long-term storage of food and water and are not able to protect people from bunker busters and repeated attacks., Manal Fouani, interim UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine, said one of the priorities of her agency’s comprehensive response is the protection of civilians in wartime. “Providing adequate infrastructure for civilians’ safety and security is just one protective measure,” she said. “When the city is being attacked, residents of Odesa need to seek a safe place to shelter, to save their own lives, and the lives of their families. Supporting them, and providing shelter for their safety and security, is one of our top priorities.”, The repair and rehabilitation work included installing an air ventilation system using electrostatic and carbon filtration, replacing all life support systems (electrical network, sewage and water supply), and providing furniture such as beds. The shelter can accommodate at least 500 people., Henadiy Trukhanov, the mayor of Odesa, thanked the partners: “We greatly appreciate any help we can get to build proper air raid shelters to protect our people,” he said., The air-raid shelter was repaired and equipped within the Ukraine Recovery Programme (URP), financed by the European Investment Bank.

Ukraine: Russian Forces Tortured Izium Detainees [EN/RU/UK],Analysis,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,19 Oct 2022,"(Kyiv, October 19, 2022) – Russian forces and others operating under their command routinely tortured detainees during their six-month occupation of Izium, a city in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine, Human Rights Watch said today., Survivors described being subjected to electric shock, waterboarding, severe beatings, threats at gunpoint, and being forced to hold stress positions for extended periods. They identified at least seven locations in the city, including two schools, where they said soldiers had detained and abused them., “The cruel violence and abuse in Izium were not random incidents,” said Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Multiple victims shared credible accounts with us of similar experiences of torture during interrogation in facilities under the control of Russian forces and their subordinates, indicating this treatment was part of a policy and plan.”, In late September and early October, Human Rights Watch spoke with over 100 people in Izium who were there during the Russian occupation of the city, from March to early September 2022. Almost all said that they had a family member or friend who had been tortured, and fifteen people, fourteen men and one woman, described being tortured themselves. One of the men had ties to the armed forces but the rest were civilians. The families and friends of two other men who were detained and tortured said the men killed themselves within days their release., Those detained were taken from their homes, on the street, or from an outdoor market and held for up to 14 days. All the men said they were given electric shocks or beaten with hands, rifle butts, metal pipes, plastic pipes, a rubber hose, and in one instance a stick with a bag of sand at the end. One man was detained five times and tortured multiple times during each detention., The woman said soldiers slapped her, punched her in the stomach, and threatened to rape her during her day-long detention. The Washington Postreported the case of another woman apparently held in the same room at a different time, who said she was repeatedly raped. A man held there at the same time said he heard women screaming and overheard soldiers talking about sexual violence against at least one detainee., One 21-year-old man said soldiers detained him at an outdoor market on July 5 or 6 because they saw a tattoo on his elbow which he said is common among some people with right wing views. He said he had the tattoo because it was also popular among some Ukrainian football fans., One man detained in early April from his workplace at the water pumping station said the soldiers forced him to be recorded on video while they accused him of being a “Banderovets,” a term used derogatorily by Russians to refer to Ukrainians who support their government; the term is an allusion to the anti-Soviet partisan movement during World War II. When he was released two days later, some of his friends told him that they had seen the video. Human Rights Watch located the video reposted on YouTube, showing the man researchers interviewed being accused of being a “Banderovets.”, All those detained said they were ordered to reveal the names of Izium residents who served in the police force, the Territorial Defense Forces, or were veterans of the 2014 Ukrainian military and security force operations in the Donbas region, known as ATO. Some were accused of possessing weapons or drugs. Two said they were asked directly whether they supported Russia. Russian forces tried to compel one man who had a generator at his home to sign a document handing his home over to them. Another said forces came to his home, put marijuana on his kitchen table, and demanded that he sign a confession that he possessed drugs., All of those interviewed who were detained said Russian soldiers stole items from them, including money, jewelry, electronics, and cars., Human Rights Watch has previously documented Russian forces’ torture of people in other regions of Ukraine that they [occupied]https://reliefweb.int/node/3868734/)., International and national medical organizations and institutions should urgently establish services in the Kharkiv region and other de-occupied areas to support victims of torture, including psychosocial (mental health) support and specialist services for survivors of sexual violence., “We are still learning about the scope of the crimes and other abuses committed against people in Izium during Russian occupation, but it is clear that survivors need assistance now,” Wille said. “Our findings indicate that Russian troops have committed horrific abuses in many areas they have occupied, and there is real concern about similar abuses in other areas they continue to control.”, For more information on the facilities where people were tortured and the types of torture documented by Human Rights Watch in Izium, please see below., Torture Facilities in Izium, Witnesses identified seven facilities in the city that Russian forces had allegedly used as bases and detention facilities: two schools, a police station, a former hospital compound, a water and sanitation station, a private residence, and a private factory. Researchers were able to enter four of the facilities and verify that they were indeed used as detention facilities. Those interviewed are identified by pseudonyms for their protection., Two of the men said they were moved to various locations and did not know where they had been held. Several families heard that people were also being detained at Izium’s School No. 2, but researchers did not identify anyone who had been held there., One former detainee showed Human Rights Watch a private home now housing Ukrainian forces, where he believes Russian forces held him for a day. He said his captors threatened him, saying: “Don’t mess with us, or Kirov special forces will show themselves.” Later they took him to another house a long drive away, telling him it was “on the front line” and that he would disappear, before they drove him back to the city and released him. Residents of the area said that Russian forces were using the first house during the time the man said he was detained., City Railway Polyclinic, A building in the Verkhnie Selysche district on the left bank of the Donets River in Izium is next to the railway station, known colloquially as the “railway district.” It had stopped operating as a hospital about two years prior to Russian forces arriving in the city. Next to the main building is another building with at least three garages. Eight men, interviewed separately, said that Russian forces had detained them and others in two garages next to the main building, which they occupied. The woman said she was held in a small room in a building opposite the garages., Human Rights Watch visited the hospital on September 22, which was largely undamaged, and inspected the garages. The two garage rooms matched the former detainees’ descriptions, such as one with a brick wall and the other with cement walls. Before Human Rights Watch visited, Ukrainian police had searched the hospital compound., All eight men said they had been tortured with electric shocks. In one room in the building, Human Rights Watch saw two electric outlets that were blackened, but it’s unclear whether this resulted from the abuse. According to two Ukrainian electrical engineers, sockets can blacken in this way if they overheat for example during electric shocks if the electrodes were located close to each other on the victim’s body., Boghdan, 36, said he was a policeman, ATO veteran, and member of the Territorial Defense Forces, and that he was detained in a garage at the City Railway Polyclinic. Boghdan was held with another ATO veteran, Yevgeny, about 40, but Boghdan said that soldiers came and took Yevgeny away. Since the area was back under Ukrainian control, Boghdan said he has tried unsuccessfully to confirm whether Yevgeny had been released and if he is still alive., Two men said that they heard women’s screams while being held in the garages. Taisa, 36, said that Russian forces detained her and her husband at their home in mid-June and took them to the City Railway Polyclinic. She said she was held alone for a day in a small room in a building opposite to the garages on the hospital compound. At one point, a soldier came to the door and shouted that she should “prepare yourself, [another] soldier will be coming to rape you,” though it didn’t happen. She said she was taken to a room in the main building and interrogated once., The Washington Post interviewed a woman who said she was held for 10 days in early July in what, according to detailed descriptions from both women, researchers determined to be the same room, and subjected to electric shocks and repeated rapes, including through forced oral sex. Boghdan, who was held during the same time period there, said he heard women’s screams on multiple occasions, and said he heard two soldiers standing outside of the garage door one day speaking. “Don’t give her food, she didn’t give a blow job,” he remembered one of them saying., When inspecting the room, Human Rights Watch saw Alla, the name of the woman interviewed by The Washington Postcarved on the wall, as well the words and phrases “electricity, undressed or raped,” “barely alive,” “murdered,” “very painful,” and “help.” She told The Washington Post that she considered trying to kill herself in detention., Those held in the garages said they were fed only once a day and given about 1.5 liters of water to share with up to 13 people held in the garage., On the wall in one of the hospital rooms researchers found an emblem and the German words “Truth Sets You Free” written on the wall in what could have been a reference to the Nazis’ use of “Work Sets You Free” – the slogan on the gate to Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps. A former employee of the hospital told researchers that the emblem and phrase appeared on the walls after Russian forces started occupying the building. The emblem could depict crossed stick grenades, which was the symbol of the Dirlewanger Brigade, a German SS brigade from World War II., The hospital compound is next to the city’s cultural center, which the Russian military used as a base, nearby residents said. Human Rights Watch visited the center and saw numerous signs of a Russian military presence. On the doors of two ground floor offices, researchers saw “3rd squad, 2nd platoon” above a large Z, and “2nd squad, 2nd platoon, 8th company,” written in black pen., Izium Central Police Station, The Izium central police station, on the right bank of the Donets River, was a key base for Russian forces during their occupation, local police, officials, and residents said. Human Rights Watch interviewed five men who said they were held and tortured there. They described the cells where they were held – on the eastern side of the building on the ground floor or in the basement. Researchers found cards on eight cell doors, apparently with the number of people in each cell, from one to four., All five men said they were taken almost every day to the basement on the western side of the building, where they were interrogated and tortured. Two said that their captors forced gas masks over their faces when their screams became too loud. Researchers found five gas masks in a large room that used to be a shooting gallery, in the basement on the left side of the police station., Taras, 31, a builder, said that on August 19 or 20, two Russian soldiers stopped him at a checkpoint, took him to his house, and searched it, where they found bullet casings that he had collected, and then detained him. Taras said they left him in their vehicle for a few hours, then three soldiers took him into the police station., “They took me to one of the offices inside and beat me on and off for three hours, one with a metal rod and the other with a plastic pipe while they demanded that I give them the names of residents who were in the Territorial Defense Forces,” Taras said. “They even put a gun to my head and threatened to shoot me unless I gave names.”, Taras said they held him for two weeks in another room with between two and four others, fluctuating over time. He said one man detained with him, Vitali, 21, had been detained with his father, who was held in an adjacent room, and they heard his screams. Taras said that he had recently seen two of the men held with him, but he did not know what had happened to the other two., Yura, 46, who works for an energy operation, said Russian forces held him at the central police station for a week in late August. He said that an ATO veteran was in the prison cell below him and prisoners were passing each other cigarettes from one floor to the next through windows at the back of the cells. He said one day the man called up to him asking for a cigarette, saying it would be his last because soldiers were going to kill him. Yura said a short while later, he heard a door open and a gunshot ring out, and he never heard the man’s voice again., School No. 6, On September 23, Human Rights Watch visited School No. 6, on the left bank of the Donets River, where two men said they were detained and tortured. Three people living next to the school said that Russian forces occupied the school from roughly April to July. Ukrainian Emergency Service workers said that they had cleared landmines and unexploded ordnance from around the school. The school showed minor signs of damage and researchers observed the remnants of three PFM-1 anti-personnel landmines that had detonated and a fourth that appeared undetonated in a patch of grass next to the school., On April 21, Ihor, 48, an electrician who was arrested five times, said three Russian soldiers came to his apartment and accused him of having marijuana. They searched the apartment, put a bag over his head, and beat him as they marched him down the stairs and to their car. He said they drove him to School No. 6 and locked him in a hallway storage closet for about half an hour. At one point he said he called them fascists and they started beating, kicking, and slapping him. They brought him to a commander who asked him to identify residents who were members of the Territorial Defense Forces or ATO. They released him the next day., Zhenia, 19, was detained twice, including once at School No. 6. He said soldiers took him from his home on August 24: “At the school, one of the soldiers in charge came over and wanted to hit me. I covered my face. He said, ‘What are you, a boxer?’ Then he called over three soldiers and they all started beating me. They held me first in a storage closet and then in an office for three days but would take me outside sometimes to ask me questions and they would beat me; they even hit me on the head with their walkie talkies.”, A man living close to School No. 6 said he visited the school and spoke to the soldiers many times and that he deduced from their accent that the forces he encountered were LNR or DNR forces (forces from “Luhansk People’s Republic” or “Donetsk People’s Republic”, areas of the Luhanska and Donetska regions respectively, currently occupied by Russia)., *School **No. *12, On September 22, Human Rights Watch visited School No. 12, also on the left bank of the Donets River, which had been significantly damaged. Four neighbors and a teacher from the preschool opposite the now heavily damaged school said Russian forces occupied the school from early March through July., Andrii, 55, a civil servant, said that Russian forces took him from his home on April 7 to the school for several hours. He said soldiers blindfolded him and others they had detained in the yard of the school and made them step on round objects:, As we stepped on top of these objects, they shouted that we should not move because we were standing on grenades, and they made sounds as if they were taking out the pins. They kept us standing like that for four hours without moving at all; we were petrified. Finally, one of the soldiers told me to move, and I told him no, I didn’t want to die. He said, “Don’t worry, I have just put the pin back in.” Later as I was leaving, I saw the yard area and I realized they had lied to us; they had made us stand on a bunch of rocks., He showed researchers photographs his wife took of him after he returned home, with bruising to his legs, side, chest, and elbow from beatings., Torture, Beatings, A retired policeman said Russian soldiers came to his home in June or July and questioned him about his son, who was a policeman and ATO veteran and had fled the area. He said LNR soldiers, and another soldier who identified himself as Chechen, entered his home, hit him with the butts of their guns, knocked him to the ground, and demanded that he give them the address of police officers and others who were storing weapons, threatening they would take him “underground, where you will tell us everything.”, Another man, a serving policeman, said that as soldiers were searching his apartment in late April, one hit him in the jaw, knocking him down a flight of stairs and breaking his left arm. He said: “I started to scream. Neighbors came out and the soldier told them to go back inside, and that I had just fallen. He then grabbed me by the collar, brought me into our apartment and forced me onto the sofa next to my wife and demanded, ‘where are your weapons?’”, Mykhailo Ivanovych, 67, who was detained in late August for 12 days, said a soldier broke his left arm when he hit him with what Mykhailo Ivanovych thought was a plastic pipe. As of late September, Mykhailo Ivanovych’s arm still had not healed properly and he was awaiting surgery to reset the arm., Ihor, the electrician who was arrested five times, said soldiers beat him, including with the butt of a rifle, when they detained him on June 24 and took him to the hospital garage. He said they blindfolded him and led him to a room where they first pulled down his pants and beat his buttocks with something hard. Then they demanded that he give them the names of residents who were members of the Territorial Defense Forces, police, or ATO veterans., Mykhailo Ivanovych said on one occasion while he was blindfolded soldiers pressed what he said felt like needles into his back and shoulders. Researchers did not see scarring to his back and, according to the medical director at Physicians for Human Rights, electric shocks could feel like needles under the skin., The men interviewed said they were also kicked, slapped, and punched. At least two men had broken ribs when they were released, and one said he also had a broken sternum., Stress Positions, Ihor said that on several occasions, soldiers made him sit on the floor with his knees bent upwards. They then bound his hands under his knees and inserted a metal rod across his chest and under his armpits in a position he referred to as the “parrot” position. He said they then lifted up the metal pipe so that he was hanging., “At some point I told them, just give me a list of names of whoever you want, and I will sign it,” he said, but they never gave him anything to sign. He said they carried out a second interrogation like this the next day, before releasing him. He said forces forced him into the same position each time he was detained., Boghdan, the policeman, ATO veteran, and Territorial Defense Forces member, said soldiers forced him into the “parrot position” at least once, but he described it slightly differently, saying the metal rod was beneath his knees and above his elbows. He said one time the metal pipe was unable to carry his weight; when soldiers lifted him up, the pipe bent and broke. Both men said that after being hung in this position, they were unable to use their arms for hours., Boghdan said that a man held in the garage cell with him was someone he had once arrested as a policeman. He said the man fed him after he had been hung in the parrot position because he couldn’t move his arms. Boghdan said soldiers also put a plastic bag over his head and cut the airflow several times. At one point, when he refused to give the soldiers any information, one threatened that they would make him “sit on a bottle,” indicating anal rape. Boghdan said Russian forces only released him after he agreed to work for them as an informant going forward. Once released, he fled to Russia, and from there to Estonia, Poland and then returned through Ukraine to Kharkiv., Oleksandr, 52, an agronomist who was detained in early September, described a position he was forced into as the “spider:” soldiers forced him to lie on his chest and tied his hands to his feet behind his back. Then they put electrical pads in his hands and gave him electric shocks., Oleksandr said soldiers took him from his home, which has its own generator and internet connection, and during his interrogations, including when they put him into the spider position, tried to force him to sign a document giving ownership of his property to the Russian army., During his five days in detention, Russian soldiers also put him in what he thought was a storage building in his t-shirt, shorts, and shoes. They opened the doors and left him there blindfolded for a full day, with temperatures dropping to what he thought was around 10 degrees Celsius, particularly at night. “By the time they came to get me the next day, I just wanted them to kill me, to put an end to it,” he said. He said he heard the voices of other people being detained in the storage hanger., While he was held, Oleksandr’s wife said Russian forces came to the house and told her they had killed Oleksandr and would bring her his ears or the whole body to prove it. She only found out he was alive when he was released. She believed they had been attempting to get her to leave their home, so soldiers could take control of it., Oleksandr showed researchers his knee, which was still inflamed due to the severe beatings., Waterboarding, Two men said they were waterboarded. Oleh, 25, a builder, said soldiers pinned him to the ground, covered his face with a cloth, and poured water over his face on and off for about 30 minutes., Andrii said that the second time soldiers arrested him, on August 11, they took him to a house and left him blindfolded in the yard for two hours. “Then they took me down into a basement and held my nose shut and poured at least two liters of water down my throat,” he said. “I started throwing up. One said to me, ‘If you don’t start talking, we will bring you to the [soldiers] on the front line and then you will talk.’”, Andrii showed researchers the cloth and duct tape that had been used around his head to cover his eyes. The abuse continued, with soldiers giving him electric shocks on his ankles on and off for another day. Finally, a soldier told him, “You aren’t useful to us, we will kill you,” and they drove him to a forested area, forced him onto his knees, and put a gun to his head. Then a soldier told him if he told anyone about what had happened to him, the soldiers would come back and kill his family. Then they let him go., Electric Shock, All 14 men interviewed said they were given electric shocks, in some cases numerous times, mostly to their ankles, but some said they were shocked on their ears, toes, hands, fingertips, and genitalia. Oleh said soldiers shocked him on his ears and also said that three men held in the garage with him told him they had been given electric shocks on their genitalia., Ihor said that during several of his interrogations, soldiers put electrical wires around his ankles and shocked him on and off for 30 or more minutes., “They electrocuted me on my ankles for so long and with so much power that it felt like I was about to have a heart attack,” Oleksandr said. “They would always stop the shock at the last minute, just when you were on the brink of your heart stopping. They beat me afterwards, but because of the shocks, I didn’t even feel the beatings anymore; I couldn’t feel anything.”, Pillage, Ihor and Zhenia said that on April 17, they were driving a neighbor with her belongings from her home, which had been damaged in an attack, to a friend’s house at around 10 a.m. They said that outside a church in the central part of the left bank of the river, where Russian forces had a checkpoint, LNR or DNR forces, which he deduced from their accents, stopped the car and checked their identity documents. Then he said they accused them of stealing the belongings, even though the owner was in the car., The forces arrested Ihor and Zhenia and took them to the hospital garage where they held them for three days. During the arrest, Ihor said a soldier hit him in the chest with a rifle butt. He said they did not arrest the woman but took the car with her belongings. While in the garage, Ihor said, they were barely fed, and were only given about 1.5 liters of water a day, to be shared among the eight other people held with them. While there, he said solders beat him once, after they searched him and found a screwdriver in his pocket., Others said Russian soldiers entered their homes and took all of their electronics, including tablets, iPhones, televisions, and family jewelry, including gold and silver necklaces and rings. They said soldiers also took money they found in their homes or on them at the time they were detained, and in some cases their cars., Suicide, Human Rights Watch spoke to relatives and friends of two men, Mykola Papirnyi, 55, and Alexander Glushchenko, 43, who were both detained – Papirnyi for about two days in late June and Glushchenko in June for a day or two and again in July for three days. Both men took their own lives by hanging a day or two after their release., A man who had been detained with Glushchenko in one of the garages at the City Railway Polyclinic said that he and Glushchenko had been tortured while in detention and that Glushchenko had what his fellow detainees thought were several broken ribs when Glushchenko left the garage. One of Papirnyi’s friends said that Papirnyi had tried to commit suicide in May, after Russian forces confiscated his trailer. On the day he died, the friend found him hanging in his yard, wearing his best suit and shoes, with a ladder nearby, she said., Legal Obligations, All parties to the armed conflict in Ukraine are obligated to abide by international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, and customary international law. Belligerent armed forces that have effective control of an area are subject to the international law of occupation., International human rights law also applies, including the absolute prohibition on torture. Both Russia and Ukraine are parties to the Convention Against Torture and have treaty obligations not only to prevent torture but to investigate and punish those who are alleged to perpetrate it., The laws of war prohibit willful killing, rape and other sexual violence, torture, and inhumane treatment of captured combatants and civilians in custody. Anyone who orders or deliberately commits such acts, or aids and abets them, is responsible for war crimes. Commanders of forces who knew or had reason to know about such crimes but did not attempt to stop them or punish those responsible are criminally liable for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility., Russia and Ukraine have obligations under the Geneva Conventions to investigate alleged war crimes committed by their forces or on their territory and appropriately prosecute those responsible. Victims of abuses and their families should receive prompt and adequate redress., Ukraine, but not Russia, has endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration, a political commitment to take concrete steps to make students, teachers, and schools safer during armed conflict, including by agreeing to refrain from using schools for military purposes.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-russian-forces-tortured-izium-detainees-enruuk

Update 120 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (18 Oct 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,18 Oct 2022,"Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has restored the connection to its last remaining operating 750 kilovolt (kV) power line after it was lost for the third time in ten days, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today., IAEA experts present at the ZNPP site were informed by senior Ukrainian operating personnel that the connection was re-established at 9:30pm local time yesterday, almost 18 hours after the line was disconnected by a protection system that automatically takes such action when the voltage drops too low., The repeated outages show how precarious the nuclear safety and security situation continues to be at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant during the current military conflict in Ukraine. They also underline the need to establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the facility, following frequent shelling at or near the plant in recent months, Director General Grossi said., During the ZNPP’s previous two external power cuts – on 8 and 12 October, respectively – the plant’s emergency diesel generators provided the back-up electricity needed for reactor cooling and other essential safety functions. Yesterday, however, the ZNPP continued to receive power from an off-site 330 kV line that supplies electricity through a back-up system that was restored late last week. With today’s re-connection of the 750 kV line, the ZNPP now has both available, although its power situation remains fragile, Director General Grossi said., While there was no shelling in the vicinity of the plant overnight and today, the IAEA team noticed four landmine explosions during the day. The IAEA team was also informed that intensive shelling of infrastructure across the country has delayed work to restore a second 330 kV back-up external power line to the switchyard of the nearby thermal power plant, though repair work is expected to be performed today., Separately, the IAEA team on site has learned of the release of a ZNPP Deputy Director General, Valeriy Martynyuk, who was detained early last week. Director General Grossi welcomed his release. It follows the detention earlier this month of ZNPP Director General Ihor Murashov, regarding which Director General Grossi had been in contact with the relevant authorities to contribute to his release., However, Director General Grossi expressed deep concern about the recent detentions of two other ZNPP staff members, which have been confirmed by the IAEA. “This is another concerning development that I sincerely hope will be resolved swiftly.”, Director General Grossi is continuing consultations on securing the nuclear safety and security protection zone at ZNPP, and it is imperative to agree this as soon as possible, he said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-120-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-18-oct-2022

UNICEF’s Back to Learning Initiative has continued, supporting uninterrupted learning and interaction for all children across Ukraine., Since 24 February, 4,532,208 children and women in Ukraine have been able to access primary health care in UNICEF-supported facilities and through mobile teams. In addition, 3,586,349 people have been provided with access to safe drinking water and 965,896 people have received critical water, sanitation and hygiene supplies, including in newly accessible areas., Since 24 February, UNICEF-supported mental health and psychosocial support interventions have reached 2,243,415 children and caregivers while 77,016 children and their families have benefited from specialized services through case management and referral to support services. Additionally, 192,749 women and children have so far been reached by UNICEF-supported gender-based violence prevention, risk mitigation and response services., Since 24 February, 856,903 children have been engaged in formal or non-formal education and 384,860 children have benefited from learning interventions with supplies provided by UNICEF., A total of 143,763 households have been reached by UNICEF-funded multi-purpose humanitarian cash transfers., Situation in Numbers, 3.3 million Children in need inside Ukraine (Ukraine Flash Appeal 2022, August revision), 17.7 million People in need inside Ukraine (Ukraine Flash Appeal 2022, August revision), 7 million Internally displaced people (OCHA, Ukraine Situation Report, 21 September 2022.), 2.3 million Children targeted by UNICEF response in Ukraine from March to December 2022 (UNICEF revised HAC appeal October 2022), Funding Overview and Partnerships, UNICEF has received US$647 million for its response inside Ukraine out of its revised funding ask of US$987 million, which will be reflected in the updated UNICEF Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) appeal, to be published shortly. The revised ask reflects additional financial requirements to scale up and sustain critical services and protection assistance in Ukraine, including priorities like back to learning and winter-specific interventions, until the end of the year. The HAC is aligned with the revised OCHA Ukraine Interagency Flash Appeal that aims to provide 11.5 million people affected by the ongoing war with urgent humanitarian assistance until the end of December 2022., Generous contributions have come from the people and Governments of Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Liechtenstein, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Vietnam, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), Education Cannot Wait, the European Commission, OCHA-Country-Based Pooled Funds (CBPF) and the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF)., Ongoing fundraising campaigns by UNICEF National Committees and country offices have generated timely, and 85 per cent flexible support from the private sector including from corporate partners, foundations, philanthropy partners and individual donors, with actual funds already remitted amounting to US$700.9 million for both inside Ukraine and refugee-hosting countries. Private sector support has been unprecedented with donations received from over 761 businesses, 219 philanthropy partners, 130 foundations and a large base of individual donors across over 24 countries. Some prominent private sector donors and partners who have made significant contributions include Mr. Dmitry Muratov, who donated the proceeds of the sale of his 2021 Nobel Peace prize, Novo Nordisk, Fonden, Pandora, William Demant Foundation, Equinor, Ericsson, H&M, Marks and Spencer, JP Morgan, Phillips , Capgemini, Visa International, Lego Foundation, Axa, Hitachi, Heartland, Formula One, Daichi Sank, United Internet, Action, Ericsson, BMW, Daimler Trucks, Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix and Olam Group, SHO Partners, Akelius Foundation, Aeon Corporate Ltd and Co-op Deli Consumers Cooperative Union, Lund Trust, Apple, Google, ING, Louis Vuitton, Toyota, PWC, EY, Heartland, Ikea, Nokia, UBS and Optimus Foundation., UNICEF continues to work with the Government of Ukraine, United Nations agencies, civil society organizations (CSOs)/non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other humanitarian partners. Close consultations are also being held with Presidential advisors, key ministries (Foreign Affairs; Social Policy; Education; Youth; and Health), and mayors in several cities (including through Child and Youth Friendly Cities) and the Ombudspersons Office. Through its long-standing presence in Ukraine, UNICEF has established partnerships in key hromadas (municipalities) and will continue to expand these in all oblasts (regions). Around 92 government and civil society partners have been engaged with UNICEF to respond to the critical needs of children and families across Ukraine., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, While fighting in eastern Ukraine intensified over the reporting period, some areas are now accessible to humanitarian actors that are quickly bringing in life-saving supplies. UNICEF was present in the first United Nations-led convoys and humanitarian missions in Kharkivska oblast that delivered food, water, hygiene kits, shelter materials and critical household items, including bedding, thermal blankets and kitchen sets to thousands of families and children who had been cut off from humanitarian assistance for more than five months., According to the Ministry of Energy, approximately 773,000 households and businesses remain without power. Pressure on the power grid can deprive children from schooling and put patients at risk in hospitals and health facilities. Between the damaged infrastructures, the intense fighting, and the limited utilities, the upcoming winter will be harsh on families. UNICEF continues to assess the pressing needs and review winter plans in close coordination with government authorities, humanitarian partners and donors. UNICEF winterization plans are well underway to support vulnerable women and children in severely affected areas., Overall, within Ukraine, nearly 7 million are estimated to be internally displaced, with the majority displaced from Donetska, Kharkivska and Luhanska oblasts in eastern Ukraine. Kyivska (north-central), Kharkivska (eastern), Poltavska (central), and Dnipropetrovska (central-eastern) oblasts host a high proportion of internally displaced people in Ukraine, with 97,000 internally displaced people per raion (district). The numbers of registered internally displaced Ukrainians are decreasing in western Ukraine in Ivano Frankivska, Lvivska and Zakarpatska oblasts, which according to IOM, is likely due to people returning to their habitual residences or resettling elsewhere. Evacuations continue from the east and south of Ukraine and are expected to pick up speed as winter approaches.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unicef-ukraine-humanitarian-situation-report-no-21-30-september-2022

Commission disburses further €2 billion in exceptional macro-financial assistance to Ukraine,News and Press Release,EC,Recovery and Reconstruction,18 Oct 2022,"The Commission has today disbursed a first instalment of €2 billion under the €5 billion exceptional macro-financial assistance (MFA) operation for Ukraine. This is part of an MFA package of up to €9 billion, announced in the Commission's 18 May Communication on Ukraine Relief and Reconstruction and endorsed by the European Council of 23-24 June 2022. It is part of the extraordinary effort by the EU, alongside the international community, to help Ukraine address its immediate financial needs following the unprovoked and unjustified aggression by Russia., The Commission already disbursed the first €1 billion of this exceptional MFA package on 1 and 2 August 2022. This followed a previous €1.2 billion emergency MFA loan paid out to Ukraine in the first half of this year. With today's payment, the total MFA support disbursed to Ukraine since the Russian attack on February 24 has reached €4.2 billion., The funds have been made available to Ukraine in the form of highly concessional loans, with longer-term maturities than under regular MFAs and on highly favourable terms. The assistance supports Ukraine's macroeconomic stability and overall resilience in the context of Russia's military aggression and the ensuing economic challenges. In a further expression of solidarity, the EU budget for the first time will cover the interest costs on this loan, at least for the current multiannual financial framework. As for all previous MFA loans, the Commission borrows funds on international capital markets and transfers the proceeds on the same terms to Ukraine. This €2 billion loan to Ukraine is being covered for 70% of its value by funds set aside from the EU budget (for 9%) and by national guarantees by the Member States (for the remaining 61%)., Today's payment was made after Ukraine complied with reporting requirements laid out in the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Commission and aiming to ensure the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the use of the funds. For subsequent payments, Ukraine will have to demonstrate satisfactory progress towards the implementation of policy actions related to economic resilience and stability, governance and rule of law and energy. These policy conditions were agreed with Ukraine in the Memorandum of Understanding and are deemed feasible and relevant in the current situation of Russia's war against Ukraine, also for the future reconstruction of the country., This financial assistance comes in addition to the unprecedented support provided by the EU to date, notably humanitarian, development and defence assistance, the suspension of all import duties on Ukrainian exports for one year or other solidarity initiatives, e.g. to address transport bottlenecks so that exports, in particular of grains, could be ensured., Next steps, The disbursement of the subsequent instalments under this €5 billion package will follow swiftly and are planned before the end of the year., In addition, work on the remaining €3 billion part of the overall exceptional MFA package of up to €9 billion is ongoing, in parallel to work on a more strategic and predictable approach of EU financing support for Ukraine in 2023., Members of the College said:, President Ursula von der Leyen said: “The EU is standing by Ukraine through financial, humanitarian and military support as well as sanctions against the Russian aggressor. EU Member States are welcoming millions of refugees from Ukraine. Today we are once again delivering on our unwavering commitment to support Ukraine. The €2 billion paid out today will help address Ukraine's acute financing needs. Additional financial support will follow before the end of the year.”, Valdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President for An Economy that Works for People said: “Today's EU disbursement of €2 billion in emergency financial assistance to support Ukraine and its people is timely as winter approaches and Russia continues its brutal aggression. This constitutes the first part of the second stage of implementing the EU's planned macro-financial assistance package to Ukraine of up to €9 billion. We are working on unlocking the remaining €3 billion of this package for later this year and for more structured emergency support to follow in 2023. Today's disbursement will strengthen Ukraine's immediate resilience, help it to maintain essential services and sustain its capacity towards recovery. The EU remains committed to supporting Ukraine's relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction, together with international partners and financial institutions.”, Johannes Hahn, Commissioner for Budget and Administration, said: “Today's disbursement of €2 billion of the exceptional MFA package is evidence of our unwavering support for Ukraine. It enables the country to cover the running costs and most pressing needs. Further disbursements will follow before the end of the year”., Paolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy, said: “Day after today, the Russian campaign of terror continues, deliberately targeting Ukrainian civilians and critical infrastructure and demonstrating to the world the moral bankruptcy of the Putin regime. And day after day, Ukrainians demonstrate to the world their incredible courage and resilience. The European Union's solidarity with the Ukrainian people is unwavering and today's €2 billion payment is another sign of that commitment. More will follow in the coming weeks and months.”, Background, The EU has already provided significant assistance to Ukraine in recent years under its macro-financial assistance programme. Between 2014 and 2021, the EU provided over €5 billion to Ukraine through five macro-financial assistance programmes to support the implementation of a broad reform agenda in areas such as the fight against corruption, an independent judicial system, the rule of law, and improving the business climate., To finance the macro-financial assistance, the Commission borrows on capital markets on behalf of the EU. The borrowing for Ukraine is foreseen in the Commission's funding plan for the second half of 2022., Macro-financial assistance operations are part of the EU's wider engagement with neighbouring countries and are intended as an exceptional EU crisis response instrument. They are available to EU neighbourhood countries experiencing severe balance-of-payments problems. In addition to macro-financial assistance, the EU supports Ukraine through several other instruments, including humanitarian aid, budget support, thematic programmes, and technical assistance and blending facilities to support investment., The decision on the new exceptional €5 billion macro-financial assistance operation was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 20 September 2022. Today's disbursement comes after the Commission and Ukraine signed on 3 October a Memorandum of Understanding laying down the policy conditions and the enhanced reporting requirements linked to this exceptional MFA., Further information, European Council Conclusions of 23 June, Communication of 18 May 2022 on Ukraine relief and reconstruction, Macro-Financial Assistance to Ukraine, EU Delegation to Ukraine",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/commission-disburses-further-eu2-billion-exceptional-macro-financial-assistance-ukraine

A war they wanted no part in., In particular, I want to draw your attention to the most vulnerable groups among them – older people and people with disabilities who experience the trauma of violence and displacement in ways we can’t even begin to understand. Since the invasion in February, thousands of people– have died, and millions of families have been torn apart. Some 2,500 schools have been damaged or destroyed, according to the Government, disrupting education for over 5 million children., Health care facilities and practitioners have endured over 600 attacks, according to the World Health Organization, barring the sick from medicines and treatment., In conflict-affected areas, electricity supply, telecommunication and transport infrastructure have been devastated, affecting people’s access to water and heat just as the cold winter months approach., Incidents of sexual and gender-based violence, including trafficking and exploitation targeting women and girls, are on the rise. And we are hearing more reports of arbitrary detention from civilians., I join the Secretary-General in his calls to end this war and the senseless suffering it has caused. And I appeal for full respect for international humanitarian law throughout all military operations – in taking constant care to spare civilians and civilian objects; in facilitating humanitarian relief; in the humane treatment of all those in the parties’ power, including persons deprived of their liberty, and more., All States must ensure accountability for grave breaches of international humanitarian law., We are making all efforts to respond to needs where we can. Under Denise’s leadership, more than 590 humanitarian partners are delivering critical assistance and protection., Many of them are national and local aid organizations, women-led organizations and volunteers who are on the forefront of these efforts. I admire their bravery, and commitment., Together, we have reached over 13 million people across the country with some form of assistance since the invasion on 24 February., Most of this assistance has been provided in Government-controlled areas. It is critical that families be able to receive assistance in areas beyond the control of the Ukrainian Government, especially in parts of Donetska, Luhanska, Khersonska and Zaporizka oblasts where people are forced to live in a perpetual state of fear – and deprivation. The war in these and other places is showing no signs of letting up and we expect needs to grow as the bombardment continues and winter comes knocking., So, I want to thank donors, the private sector and individuals for your generous support. Now I need to call on you to keep up this support for humanitarian assistance. The people of Ukraine are displaying a resilience and fortitude that has awed all of us., We must continue to help them with life’s essentials, to ease their suffering and enable them to stand tall, dignity intact, as their struggle continues., Thank you very much.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/remarks-assistant-secretary-general-and-deputy-emergency-relief-coordinator-joyce-msuya-member-states-briefing-humanitarian-situation-ukraine-new-york-18-october-2022

Promotion and protection of human rights: human rights situations and reports of special rapporteurs and representatives, Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, Note by the Secretary-General, The Secretary-General has the honour to transmit to the General Assembly the report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, submitted in accordance with paragraph 11 (f) of Human Rights Council resolution 49/1, on the situation of human rights in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression., Summary, In this report, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine will refer to findings about events during late February and March 2022 in the four regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Sumy, as requested by Human Rights Council resolution S-34/1., During this first phase of its investigations, the Commission has found that war crimes, violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in Ukraine since 24 February 2022. Russian armed forces are responsible for the vast majority of the violations identified., Ukrainian forces have also committed international humanitarian law violations in some cases, including two incidents that qualify as war crimes., The Commission, composed of three experts, applies a “reasonable grounds to conclude” standard of proof in reaching its conclusions, based on a body of verified information., The relentless use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas has killed and injured scores of civilians and devastated entire neighbourhoods. The Commission documented indiscriminate attacks using cluster munitions, unguided rockets, and air strikes in the context of Russian armed forces’ attempts to capture towns and smaller settlements., These weapons systems are highly likely to have indiscriminate effects and cause significant harm to civilians. Indeed, most of the verified deaths since the outset of the hostilities have been caused by these weapons. Residential buildings, schools, and hospitals, among other parts of the civilian infrastructure, have been damaged or destroyed.
The Commission also found that Russian armed forces have shot at civilians attempting to flee and that during the conduct of hostilities, parties have deployed their military assets and troops in ways that can endanger civilians, in contravention of international humanitarian law., Furthermore, the Commission documented patterns of summary executions, unlawful confinement, torture, ill-treatment, rape and other sexual violence committed in areas occupied by Russian armed forces across the four regions on which it focused. People have been detained, some have been unlawfully deported to the Russian Federation, and many are still reported missing. Sexual violence has affected victims of all ages. Victims, including children, were sometimes forced to witness the crimes., Children have become the victims of the full spectrum of violations investigated by the Commission, including indiscriminate attacks, torture, and rape, suffering the predictable psychological consequences., These violations continue to have a devastating effect for victims and survivors. Significantly, victims emphasised the essential role of justice and accountability. In this regard, the Commission recommends enhanced coordination of international and national accountability efforts, to improve effectiveness and prevent harm to victims and witnesses.
The Commission, consistent with its mandate, will seek to contribute to the identification of those responsible.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/report-independent-international-commission-inquiry-ukraine-a77533advance-unedited-version-enruuk

"As Winter Approaches and Conflict Intensifies, Project HOPE Expands Mobile Medical Units into Eastern Ukraine",News and Press Release,HOPE,Health,18 Oct 2022,"Washington, DC (18 October 2022) – Project HOPE – the global health and humanitarian aid organization – has expanded into newly liberated areas of Eastern Ukraine to address the urgent health needs of those who are most impacted by the crisis. With winter swiftly approaching and a recent escalation in civilian casualties, it is critical that we protect humanitarian access, increase support for re-establishing vital health and medical care – particularly in the newly accessible areas – and double down on our commitment to support our friends throughout Ukraine., In the last month, Project HOPE has established an office in Kharkiv and is expanding deeper into the newly liberated territories – including Balakleya and Izyum – with mobile medical units to support those who have been cut off from accessing medical care. Many of those who were unable to evacuate – including the elderly and people with disabilities – have been without access to primary medical care since late February., “Healthcare facilities throughout Eastern Ukraine have sustained heavy damage and many healthcare providers evacuated to safety with their families when the conflict broke out. Those who stayed behind have been overburdened and left to treat war-related injuries that are unfamiliar to them,” said Karina Meyer, Program Officer for Ukraine, Project HOPE. “In eastern Ukraine, medical supply chains have been cut off for months, forcing healthcare facilities to rely on unsafe methods or deny treatment altogether. Moreover, care for chronic illnesses in conflict-affected communities is even more scarce. And when treatment for chronic illnesses does exist, people cannot afford it with incomes and pensions as low as $100 per month. We are proud of the efforts of our heroic mobile medical teams, but they can only do so much.”, With the fall and winter season approaching, the living conditions of internally displaced people (IDPs) are particularly alarming. Nearly a quarter of IDPs are without adequate housing for winter conditions, and over a third of those are unable to relocate, mostly due to a lack of funding. Among the two million IDPs in villages, 30% have no access to medical services. Over 700,000 households and businesses across the country remain without power and nearly 600,000 are without gas, which will be deadly as temperatures continue to rapidly decline., The humanitarian situation in Izium and Kupiansk, in Ukraine’s Kharkivska oblast, is extremely concerning after months of intense hostilities have left behind a path of destruction. In Izium, essential services have been decimated, leaving between 8,000 and 9,000 people completely dependent on humanitarian aid to survive., “We are bearing witness to a once-in-a-generation war that is ravaging communities, tearing families apart, and sending ripple effects across the globe,” said Chris Skopec, Executive Vice President of Global Health, Project HOPE., “As Project HOPE teams continue to gain access to newly liberated areas, we see the devastation of war everywhere we go – in the ravaged towns, ransacked medical facilities, and in the faces of Ukrainians who have endured so much. And, as the temperatures swiftly plummet and missiles continue to rain down in civilian areas, humanitarian and medical access is a matter of life-or-death.”, How Project HOPE is Responding in Ukraine:, Project HOPE continues to implement a highly coordinated, comprehensive humanitarian intervention in Ukraine and in the neighboring countries of Moldova, Poland, and Romania. Emergency programming in Ukraine focuses on supporting local primary and secondary health facilities with essential medical equipment and supplies. In the surrounding countries, Project HOPE has partnered with 11 local organizations to target gaps in essential services including primary health, mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), and protection. In all locations, Project HOPE continues to work closely with government officials, local partners, and coordination clusters to ensure efforts address the most pressing needs., Access photos with caption and credit information here., To schedule an interview, please contact Courtney Ridgway: cridgway@ProjectHOPE.org, About Project HOPE, Founded in 1958, Project HOPE is a leading global health and humanitarian organization operating in more than 25 countries around the world.

"UN Commission has found an array of war crimes, violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in Ukraine [EN/UK]",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,18 Oct 2022,"NEW YORK/ VIENNA - Based on its investigations of the events in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Sumy regions in late February and March 2022, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine has found reasonable grounds to conclude that an array of war crimes, violations of human rights and international humanitarian law have been committed in Ukraine. Given the gravity of the identified violations, there is an undeniable need for accountability, the Commission said on the day of submitting a detailed written report to the UN General Assembly., ""The impact of these violations on the civilian population in Ukraine is immense. The loss of lives is in the thousands. The destruction of infrastructure is devastating,"" said Chair of the Commission Erik Møse., The Commission documented attacks where explosive weapons were used indiscriminately in populated areas that were under attack by Russian armed forces. The Commission also found that Russian armed forces attacked civilians attempting to flee., There are also examples of both parties to the armed conflict, although to different degrees, failing to protect civilians or civilian objects against the effects of attacks, by locating military objects and forces within or near densely populated areas., Russian armed forces are responsible for the vast majority of the violations identified, including war crimes. Ukrainian forces have also committed international humanitarian law violations in some cases, including two incidents that qualify as war crimes., The Commission documented patterns of summary executions, unlawful confinement, torture, ill-treatment, rape and other sexual violence committed in areas occupied by Russian armed forces across the four regions on which it focused. People have been detained, some have been unlawfully deported to the Russian Federation, and many are still reported missing. Sexual violence has affected victims of all ages. Family members, including children, were sometimes forced to witness the crimes.  , These violations continue to have a devastating effect on civilians. Significantly, victims emphasised the essential role of justice and accountability. Family members who lost loved ones have expressed a strong need for justice to be done. A stepfather whose son was killed in Bucha told the Commission: ""I used to want to find those who were responsible and kill them. But now I want the guilty to be put on trial and I want the truth to come out."", In this regard, the Commission recommends enhanced coordination of international and national accountability efforts to improve effectiveness and prevent harm to victims and witnesses. The Commission, consistent with its mandate, will seek to contribute to the identification of those responsible.   , The Commission visited 27 towns and settlements and has interviewed 191 victims and witnesses. Its investigators inspected sites of destruction, graves, places of detention and torture, as well as weapon remnants, and consulted a large number of documents and reports., Having paid particular attention to violations committed in the four regions specified in the May resolution - Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy - the Commission will gradually devote more of its resources to the broader time scope, wider geographical and thematic framework as tasked by the March resolution., Issues of interest will include possible violations in filtration camps, alleged forced transfers of people, conditions under which expedited adoptions of children are allegedly taking place, as well as changes in local administration and so-called referenda, the consequences of which are becoming clearer given recent events., The full report as submitted to the UN General Assembly can be found here., The Members of the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine are available for interviews., Background, The United Nations Human Rights Council created the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine to investigate violations and abuses of human rights, violations of international humanitarian law, and related crimes that may have been committed in the context of the aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine. The Commission is required to present its findings and recommendations, including on accountability of those responsible for the violations, to the UN Human Rights Council in March 2023.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",18 Oct 2022,"Starting on 24 February 2022, a large-scale armed conflict in Ukraine triggered an unprecedented humanitarian crisis across the country, characterised, among other elements, by the displacement of a significant proportion of the Ukrainian population., As early as April 2022, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) began observing significant return movements. Conditions of return vary widely, as returnees arrive back to areas not directly affected by the war, but which have experienced a significant influx of internally displaced persons (IDPs), as well as to conflict-affected and recently de-occupied areas which have sustained severe damage. Due to the volatility of the current situation, it is impossible to determine what proportion of the returns observed at present are permanent or temporary. Existing data shows, however, that the returnee population in Ukraine is characterized by a unique set of needs and vulnerabilities which set it apart from those who had never been displaced and from the population of IDPs., To support partners in providing targeted, evidence-based assistance to those returning to their areas of habitual residence following a period of forced displacement, IOM presents the Ukraine Returns Report. This publication will strive to analyze IOM’s latest data on the situation and needs of the returnee population and on the conditions of return, collected through the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) assessments conducted in the country., This September 2022 edition of the Ukraine Returns Report presents a detailed analysis of data collected through the ninth round of IOM’s General Population Survey (GPS), conducted between 17 and 26 September among the adult population in Ukraine. The geographical scope of the assessment covers the entire territory of Ukraine, all five macro-regions (West, East, North, Centre, South, and the city of Kyiv), with the exception of the Crimean peninsula and the non-government-controlled-areas of Ukraine (NGCA). The general population survey was conducted using a random‐digit‐dial (RDD) approach, and 2,002 unique and anonymous respondents aged 18 and over were interviewed using the computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) method.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-returns-report-1-september-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",18 Oct 2022,"Executive Summary, Conflict, By early September, Ukrainian forces started recapturing areas of Kharkiv oblast, reaching the city of Lyman (Donetsk oblast) by the end of the month. The liberation of thousands of square kilometres resulted in the grim discovery of a mass grave in Izyum (containing of 447 bodies). Ukrainian forces also continue to make progress in the south towards the city of Kherson. Shelling and missile strikes continue to cause the majority of casualties with 1,222 civilian casualties registered by OHCHR in September., Displacement, The displacement picture saw a significant change with a decrease of 730,000 IDPs in September compared to the previous month (10.5% drop). However, the number of returnees remains relatively static. Conflict and safety remain the biggest push/pull factors. The majority of IDPs continue to originate from, and reside in, the eastern part of Ukraine. Latest survey data indicates a significant drop in the proportion of female IDPs, although they still represent 61% of the overall IDP population. The number of refugees from Ukraine continues to increase in Europe with over 7.6 million individuals having fled their country, a 600,000 people increase compared to the previous month., Humanitarian Access, To protect civilians from the conflict, Ukrainian authorities have decided to conduct compulsory evacuations in oblasts close to the front line, namely Donetska, Kharkivska, Khersonska, Luhanska and Zaporizka oblasts. More than 80,000 people have been evacuated since August. On the humanitarian actors’ side, newly liberated areas were successfully reached with critical supplies, despite the fuel challenges and risks from Explosive Remnants of War (ERW). However, with winter approaching, access is threatened by potential frozen roads and difficult weather conditions., Humanitarian Conditions, The conflict is still centred mostly in eastern and southern Ukraine and continues to put civilian lives at risk, leading to an increase in rights violations in September (including forced displacement and detention) and inherent trauma. In addition to the direct impact on people, damage to critical facilities and to civilian infrastructure continues to impact access to services for the population, as well as livelihood opportunities, notably due to business closures in conflict-affected areas. Livelihood coping strategies are heavily reported by 96% of IDPs and 91% of non-displaced. Elderly persons and persons with disabilities are amongst the most vulnerable groups, with many of them facing barriers to accessing finances (such as pensions) and thus to accessing services such as healthcare, but many also face barriers to humanitarian aid., This is aggravated by inflation driving up the price of goods and services, including food, medicines and fuel. The lack of WASH facilities (due to damage and disruption) is increasing the risk of communicable diseases. Indeed, respiratory diseases have already increased in September and are likely to increase even more as winter approaches. Multisectoral risks are exacerbated with the coming of the winter, 12 million people are in need of shelter repair materials and thus vulnerable to the weather conditions (likely to drop to -20 degrees Celsius in some parts of the country), the issue further compounded by widespread electricity and heating disruption. Moreover, food consumption remains a challenge for seven million people even though the number of people reporting lack of food decreased compared to August. Positive news was the restarting of schools on September 1st; however, many are forced to use mixed modalities or distance learning due to insecurity., Overall, needs are shifting with the onset of winter with utility bills, fuel and heating appliances becoming widespread needs across the affected groups. Whilst financial support remains the preferred option this should not mask issues around food security (close to half the households in all affected groups cited food as a use for financial assistance). Health needs remain high, as does the need for hygiene items (including menstrual hygiene products).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-crisis-situational-analysis-17-oct-2022

Both residential and non-residential buildings have been struck – leading to deaths and injuries, while others have been rescued from the rubble, according to reports., There has also reportedly been more damage inflicted on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, with hundreds of towns and villages having lost power, including in the north-eastern Sumska oblast and the central Dnipropetrovska oblast., The Mayor of the southern city of Mykolaiv said that a drone strike there set a sunflower-oil terminal and pharmaceutical warehouse on fire., The UN and humanitarian partners, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and The Red Cross Society of Ukraine, are responding to immediate needs while continuing to access the newly retaken areas of the country and helping at least 2.4 million Ukrainians prepare for winter, SITUATION OVERVIEW, Drone and air attacks were reported in Kyiv and other locations across Ukraine on 17 October, according to Government officials, humanitarian security reports and humanitarian partners – a week after the intensification of air and missile attack in the capital and country on 10 October (see Ukraine: Escalation of Attacks Across the Country – Flash Updates Nos. 1-3). The Kyiv City Administration reported early morning on 17 October that several residential buildings had been damaged and a fire started in a non-residential building in the central Shevchenkivskyi district. Ukrainian Railways reported shelling near the capital’s central train station. City officials announced that all education facilities in Kyiv had switched to remote learning., More reports of attacks involving drones, missiles and shelling continued to be received from across Ukraine throughout the day – along with updated reports of more damage to civilian infrastructure and more civilian casualties. At around noon, the Ukrainian Red Cross reported that one person had been killed in a drone strike on a residential building in Kyiv and that more people had been rescued from beneath the rubble and taken to hospital. Not long afterwards, the Office of the President of Ukraine (OPU) updated that 2 people had been killed in Kyiv, another 4 injured and 19 rescued. Meanwhile, the north-eastern Sumska oblast reported that at least three people had been killed and a further nine injured when rockets struck a civilian building, and that rescuers were searching for survivors. The Mayor of Mykolaiv, the administrative centre of the southern Mykolaivska oblast, said that drone strikes there had sparked fires at a sunflower-oil terminal and pharmaceutical warehouse. From 1 to 16 October the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) recorded 680 civilian casualties in Ukraine., The Ukrainian Government reported that the drone and missile strikes had damaged more energy infrastructure in multiple oblasts, including in Sumska and the central Dnipropetrovska oblasts – a report confirmed by a humanitarian partner. The Government said that the power supply in hundreds of towns and villages was disrupted as a result, while adding that restoration works were already underway. The Government repeated its recent call for all Ukrainians to restrict their use of electricity, especially during peak hours. Last week, Ukraine’s Energy Minister was reported saying that almost one-third of the country’s energy infrastructure had been impacted and damaged in the strikes on 10 and 11 October alone., Separately, the Office of the President of Ukraine and oblast authorities reported at least 62 civilian casualties across Ukraine over 14, 15 and 16 October, including as a result of missile strikes and shelling in both Ukraine Governmentcontrolled and non-Ukraine controlled areas. Some 25 civilian casualties were reported in the areas of the eastern Donetska oblast currently beyond the Government’s control.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-flash-update-no4-17-october-2022-enukru

This included in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia during much of the reporting period and then during a massive attack in cities right across the country on 10, 11 and 12 October – resulting in more civilian casualties and extensive damage to critical infrastructure. The shelling of civilian convoys in the eastern Kharkivska and southeastern Zaporizka oblasts reportedly killed and injured dozens of people., While the so-called referendums on parts of Ukraine joining the Russian Federation – eastern Donetska and Luhanska, southern Khersonska, and south-eastern Zaporizka oblasts – were condemned by Ukraine and its Western partners. President Vladimir Putin went on to announce the annexation of the regions 30 September. The moves – along with the Russian Federation’s announcement on 21 September of a military mobilization – have been widely interpreted as contributing to the uncertainty and instability around the war, including on the issues of freedom of movement and humanitarian access. On 12 October the UN General Assembly passed a resolution stating the attempted annexation of these regions as illegal. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reported that, in at least some cases, men in the areas that are not under control of the Ukrainian Government are being conscripted to fight in the war on the side of the Russian Federation., The shelling of a convoy of civilian vehicles in Zaporizka oblast on 30 September resulted in the reported deaths of at least 25 people and injuries to 50 more. The people in the convoy had reportedly planned to drive into the areas of the oblast that were beyond the control of the Government of Ukraine to deliver supplies and evacuate relatives. Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine Denise Brown was among those who condemned the attack while saying that, unfortunately, it was only one of the attacks leading to civilian casualties in Ukraine that day. On 1 October, it was reported that a similar incident had occurred the previous week, likely on 25 September, when a convoy of civilian vehicles was shelled near Kupiansk in Kharkivska oblast – killing at least 20 people, including 13 children and a pregnant woman. On 7 October, a humanitarian security report identified at least five civilians killed and another five injured in an air attack while part of a civilian convoy in Khersonska oblast., Other incidents showed the ongoing dangers to everyone in areas where the Government of Ukraine regained control, especially in Kharkivska oblast. Reports from 25 September show two civilians seriously injured in shelling while waiting to receive supplies in Kozacha Lopan, north of Kharkiv and along the Russian border. Ongoing reports also indicated that civilians had been killed and injured in landmine explosions in multiple locations, including when an ambulance reportedly set off a mine explosion near Balakliia on 2 October, killing the driver and injuring a medical assistant. The NGO Nonviolent Peaceforce on 23 September published the report Kharkiv Snapshot: Civilian Protection Needs & Responses in Ukraine – focusing on the risks and needs in the areas, where the Government of Ukraine regained control., A massive wave of air and missile attacks across Ukraine on 10 October, and continuing the next two days, killed and injured scores of people, including in the centre of Kyiv, and damaged critical infrastructure – especially power, heating, water and gas utilities. The State Emergency Service of Ukraine (SESU) reported at least 120 civilian casualties, including 19 people killed. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was “deeply shocked by today's large-scale missile attacks by the armed forces of the Russian Federation on cities across Ukraine that reportedly resulted in widespread damage to civilian areas and led to dozens of people being killed and injured” and added that, “this constitutes another unacceptable escalation of the war and, as always, civilians are paying the highest price.”, Since the full-scale war began in February, verified civilian casualties in Ukraine have now exceeded 15,500. The Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) verified, as of 9 October, at least 15,592 civilian casualties – with 6,221 people having been killed and 9,371 injured. Most civilian casualties continued to be recorded and verified in the eastern Donetska and Luhanska oblasts – 56 per cent or a total of 8,653 casualties, including 3,696 people killed and 4,957 injured. HRMMU continued to stress that it believes the actual figures are much higher. On 27 September, HRMMU published its Report on the Human Rights Situation in Ukraine: 1 February-31 July 2022 – covering issues including damage and destruction to civilian objects and economic and social rights. And the World Health Organization, through its Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care, showed that verified attacks on health care in Ukraine – some 550 since 24 February – represent approximately three-quarters of the global total of 750 over the same period. Finally, the UN Human Rights Council reported on 23 September that the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, based on its investigations into events in northern Chernihivska and Kyivska, north-eastern Sumska and eastern Kharkivska oblasts, “has concluded that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine., Concerning internal displacement, assessments indicate that the situation remains far from stable. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported in its General Population Survey Round 9 that, while the total number of internally displaced Ukrainians decreased by more than 732,000 between August and September to 6,243,000 million, more than 740,000 people countrywide also said they are considering moving before the start of the heating season and winter. Authorities in the western Lvivska oblast told colleagues from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) that they are among those expecting an increase in displaced people because of the ongoing fighting and lack of basic utilities in parts of eastern and southern Ukraine. Among the more in-depth studies on internal displacement, REACH Initiative on 30 September published a report on needs, responses and gaps – just days after REACH also posted, on 26 September, an assessment focusing on central Dnipropetrovska oblast. Taking a wider view of the response throughout the war, the International Crisis Group on 26 September published the study Responding to Ukraine’s Displacement Crisis: From Speed to Sustainability – arguing in part that “the grassroots effort organized to help them is not sustainable” and that, “donors should keep channeling aid to civil society but lay the groundwork for the state to step in.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-12-oct-2022-enuk

Keeping watch over Ukraine’s humanitarian cyberspace,News and Press Release,ETC,Logistics and Telecommunications,17 Oct 2022,"The Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) secure internet network in Ukraine keeps responders―and their information―safe from recurrent cyberattacks, Cyberspace―where much of us spend our time―is extremely vulnerable to attack. In Ukraine, reports of cyber insecurity amid the conflict are rife. It is reported that the first month of active conflict saw three times as many cyberattacks against Ukraine’s information infrastructure compared to the same period in the previous year***., Against this backdrop, it is critical to protect humanitarian responders from disruptive malware, network jamming, and information breaches so they can focus on delivering lifesaving assistance to crisis-affected populations., The WFP-led Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) provides a secure internet connection to the community of inter-agency responders in Dnipro and Lviv, two key operational locations in central and western Ukraine. More than 260 humanitarian responders from 12 UN agencies and INGOs have registered on the ETC connectivity network since the onset of the crisis., “The loss of hours associated with network jamming can and is capable of jeopardizing the humanitarian operational response and effective coordination among frontline actors,” says Prakash Muniandy, head of the WFP Technology Division (TEC) in Ukraine., Equipped to respond to cyber threats, ETC partner Cisco Crisis Response bolstered the cybersecurity set-up for the ETC secure network by providing vital expertise in technical design and equipment. Regular reports from Cisco on attempted cyberattacks to the network are pinged to the team in Ukraine almost daily., WFP FITTEST’s IT Emergency Specialist Abdul Halim Yousufzai explains, “Although it’s impossible to 100% secure any network, our ETC network is mitigated against attacks of many kinds, protected behind a robust firewall.”, Invisible yet critical, the behind-the-scenes fight against cyberattack is 24/7., Secure data solutions are crucial to all WFP TEC operations―and the people we serve within them. Currently, cash-based assistance is being delivered to over 700,000 people affected by the crisis across Ukraine, with plans to reach up to 1.5 million people by the end of the year., Cash transfer platforms and tools used by WFP must be kept digitally protected to ensure this assistance safely reaches those who need it most., Leopold Happy, Senior TEC Officer comments, “Cybersecurity is everyone’s challenge. Through an intensive campaign, WFP in Ukraine has been able to proactively contain and prevent any attacks on our networks, enabling us to save and change lives in a safe working environment.”, The secure cyber solutions deployed in Ukraine are a key tool in the armour needed to prevent phishing attacks targeting humanitarian workers and the hacking of communications channels that are often a lifeline in emergency operations., Armed with these cyber tools, responders using the secure network in Ukraine can log in each morning amid the unfolding crisis knowing the flow of humanitarian data and information is safe, ultimately ensuring assistance securely reaches affected communities across Ukraine., ----, * Державна служба спеціального зв›язку та захисту інформації України [State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection of Ukraine], “За місяць війни вже сталося майже втричі більше хакерських атак різного виду, ніж за аналогічний період минулого року [During one month of conflict, there have been almost three times as many hacker attacks as during the same time period last year],” Facebook, 3 April 2022.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/keeping-watch-over-ukraines-humanitarian-cyberspace

The impact of the war in Ukraine and subsequent economic downturn on child poverty in Eastern Europe and Central Asia,Analysis,UNICEF,"Education

Protection and Human Rights",17 Oct 2022,"Child poverty across eastern Europe and Central Asia soars by 19 per cent, as Ukraine war and rising inflation drive four million children into poverty - UNICEF, On the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, UNICEF warns that the ripple effects of the increase in child poverty could result in a steep rise in school dropouts and infant mortality, GENEVA/NEW YORK, 17 October 2022 – The war in Ukraine and rising inflation have driven an additional four million children across eastern Europe and Central Asia into poverty, a 19 per cent increase since 2021, according to a new UNICEF study published today., The impact of the war in Ukraine and subsequent economic downturn on child poverty in eastern Europe and Central Asia – which features data from 22 countries* across the region - shows that children are bearing the heaviest burden of the economic crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. While children make up 25 per cent of the population, they account for nearly 40 per cent of the additional 10.4 million people experiencing poverty this year., The Russian Federation accounts for nearly three-quarters of the total increase in the number of children living in poverty due to the Ukraine war and a cost-of-living crisis across the region, with an additional 2.8 million children now living in households below the poverty line. Ukraine is home to half a million additional children living in poverty, the second largest share, followed by Romania, with an additional 110,000 children, the study notes., “Beyond the obvious horrors of war – the killing and maiming of children, mass displacement – the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine are having a devastating impact on children across eastern Europe and Central Asia,” said UNICEF Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia Afshan Khan. “Children all over the region are being swept up in this war’s terrible wake. If we don’t support these children and families now, the steep rise in child poverty will almost certainly result in lost lives, lost learning, and lost futures.”, The consequences of child poverty stretch far beyond families living in financial distress. The sharp increase could result in an additional 4,500 children dying before their first birthdays, and learning losses could be equivalent to an additional 117,000 children dropping out of school this year alone, the study notes., The poorer a family is, the greater the proportion of their income committed to necessities such as food and fuel. When the cost of basic goods soars, the money available to meet other needs such as health care and education falls, the study notes. The subsequent cost-of-living crisis means that the poorest children are even less likely to access essential services, and are more at risk of violence, exploitation and abuse., For many, childhood poverty lasts a lifetime. One in three children born and raised in poverty will live their adult lives in poverty, leading to an intergenerational cycle of hardship and deprivation, the study notes., The challenges faced by families living in or on the brink of poverty deepen when governments reduce public expenditure, increase consumption taxes or put in place austerity measures in a limiting effort to boost their economies in the short-term, as this diminishes the reach and quality of support services that families depend on., The study sets out a framework to help reduce the number of children living in poverty and prevent more families from falling into financial distress:, UNICEF has recently partnered with the EU Commission and several EU countries to pilot the EU Child Guarantee initiative to mitigate the impact of poverty on children and provide them with opportunities to thrive in adulthood. With more children and families now being pushed into poverty, a robust response is warranted across the region., UNICEF is calling for continued and expanded support to strengthen social protection systems in high- and middle-income countries in eastern Europe and Central Asia; and the prioritization of funding for social protection programmes, including cash assistance programmes for vulnerable children and families., “Austerity measures will hurt children most of all – plunging even more children into poverty and making it harder for families who are already struggling,” said Khan. “We have to protect and expand social support for vulnerable families before the situation gets any worse.”, *including Kosovo, under UNSC Resolution 1244, Media contacts, Iryna Mazur

Russia-Ukraine: ICRC ready to visit all prisoners of war but access must be granted [EN/RU],News and Press Release,ICRC,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,16 Oct 2022,"Geneva (ICRC) - A team of 11 staff of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), including one doctor, is ready in Donetsk to visit any prisoners of war held in the area, including at the Olenivka penal facility. Their mission would be to check on the conditions of internment and treatment, deliver essential supplies, and ensure the prisoners of war can contact their families., The intense hostilities in the area today underscore the dangers involved and how difficult this mission has been to fulfill. Our team has been ready for months, but to this day does not have at the same time both the minimal security guarantees on the ground and the local authorisation to conduct a visit., This is emblematic of a wider and unacceptable fact: today, the ICRC still does not have unimpeded and repeated access to all prisoners of war in this international armed conflict. This is despite nearly eight months of persistent demands by our teams to visit all places of detention and internment., Blaming the ICRC for being denied full and immediate access does not help prisoners of war or their families. The ones who can make a difference for prisoners of war in any international armed conflict are the States involved and the detaining authorities. They are the ones obliged to treat them humanely in line with the Geneva Conventions and to give the ICRC access to all of them., Prisoners of war are entitled to receive regular visits from delegates of the ICRC under the Third Geneva Convention. In any armed conflict, when we visit prisoners of war we give them and their families the emotional lifeline of keeping in touch with one another. We provide ongoing essential care such as medical assistance., We share our findings and recommendations for concrete improvements to their treatment and internment conditions confidentially and directly with the authorities. Prisoners of war and their families deserve that glimmer of hope and humanity in the agony of armed conflict., Any actions we take---whether in public or behind closed doors---are guided by one priority: the lives, integrity, and wellbeing of prisoners of war. Our determination is undimmed. We will never stop demanding access to prisoners of war until we are able to see all of them not just once, but repeatedly, wherever they are held., Note to editors and producers:, 1. Established in 1863, the ICRC operates worldwide, helping people affected by conflict and armed violence and promoting the laws that protect victims of war. A neutral, independent and impartial organization, its mandate stems from the Geneva Conventions of 1949. it is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and works in more than 100 countries., 2. The ICRC has been working in Ukraine since 2014 with a team of over 600 staff members.

Update 118 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (14 Oct 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,14 Oct 2022,"Ukrainian engineers have managed to restore back-up power to the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), a much-needed development after the plant twice over the past week lost all access to external electricity, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today., The availability of back-up off-site electricity through the switchyard of the nearby thermal power station provides Europe’s largest nuclear power plant with a buffer if the connection to its last remaining operating 750 kilovolt (kV) power line were to be cut again, the Director General said., When the ZNPP’s connection to the high-voltage line was temporarily cut on Saturday and again on Wednesday due to damage caused by shelling, the plant had to rely on its emergency diesel generators for electricity until the line was restored., In recent days, two of the ZNPP’s back-up power lines – connecting it to the thermal power plant switchyards – have been repaired, the IAEA team at the site reported to Agency headquarters. Today, one of the 330 kV external lines connecting the switchyard of the thermal power plant to the grid was also restored, enabling the plant to receive electricity that way, if needed., “Working in very challenging conditions, operating staff at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant are doing everything they can to bolster its fragile off-site power situation. Restoring the back-up power connection is a positive step in this regard, even though the overall nuclear safety and security situation remains precarious,” Director General Grossi said., Before the conflict, the ZNPP had access to the grid through four high-voltage power lines, but three of them have fallen victim to the fighting. The back-up power lines – offering indirect access to the electricity grid – had also been down in recent weeks., A secure off-site power supply from the grid is essential for ensuring nuclear safety, also with the six reactors in a shutdown mode. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict., The IAEA team also said further preparatory activities to restart reactor unit 5 were continuing, and that work to also restart unit 6 was expected to get under way tomorrow. Restart will take a number of days., Separately, the ZNPP has received additional fuel supplies for its 20 diesel generators, following the arrival of seven trucks, of which five recently came from the city of Zaporizhzhya, and two earlier from Russian-controlled territory, the IAEA team said. The plant currently has fuel for at least ten days operation of diesel should external power be lost., Director General Grossi has in recent weeks engaged in high-level consultations with Ukraine and Russia aimed at agreeing and implementing a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP as soon as possible, stressing it is urgently needed to help prevent a nuclear accident. The consultations are progressing., During recent high-level meetings in Ukraine and Russia, he has also raised the increasingly difficult and challenging work conditions for the ZNPP’s Ukrainian staff. They are facing “unacceptable pressure”, he said, due to demands to sign a new employment contract with Russian state company Rosatom to keep their jobs, while national Ukrainian operator Energoatom is urging them not to do so and instead follow its instructions., “I made clear that the staff must be allowed to carry out their vital tasks without undue interference or pressure,” the Director General said., Since early August, there has been frequent shelling at or near the ZNPP, causing widespread concern about nuclear safety and security at the site. In the past few days, the IAEA team said, there appears to have been little shelling in the vicinity of the plant itself. However, there were two landmine explosions in the afternoon today outside the ZNPP perimeter fence.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-118-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-14-oct-2022

WHO is in Ukraine for the long haul,News and Press Release,WHO,Health,14 Oct 2022,"Statement by WHO Regional Director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, 14 October 2022, In just ten days from now we will mark eight months of relentless war in Ukraine., But this week, the bombings of Kyiv, Dnipro and other cities nationwide have refocused global attention to the survival of the civilian population of Ukraine – and the survival of the health system itself., The escalation of the humanitarian emergency requires an escalation of the humanitarian response., Let me clearly state: WHO is there to stay. To stay and support the Ministry of Health, under the leadership of Health Minister Dr Viktor Liashko. To stay and support our more than 150 health partners on the ground., The immediate priority: Responding urgently to the damage done by the latest attacks on health – with the current total of WHO-confirmed attacks on health at 620 since the war began in February. We need to scale up our support to the rebuilding process., In parallel, we have ongoing efforts to boost the capacity – and the morale - of the exhausted health and care workforce. So far, WHO has helped train about 11,000 healthcare workers on a range of issues including trauma surgery, mass casualties, chemical exposure, epidemiology and laboratory diagnostics., This complements ongoing efforts to bring in lifesaving medical supplies – over 1,300 metric tons so far. Supplies such as power generators for healthcare facilities; oxygen; ambulances; surgical kits; medicines to treat non-communicable diseases; and vaccines, both for routine immunization and COVID-19., The second priority are the immediate health needs of people in the newly accessible areas back under Ukrainian control. We must find ways to respond to the magnitude of physical and mental suffering endured by these populations. Also, for months now, we have been urgently requesting humanitarian access to occupied areas like Mariupol and Donbas, so that WHO and partners can assess needs and provide support., The third priority is anticipating and preparing for the significant challenges that winter will bring. Too many people in Ukraine are living precariously, moving from location to location, living in sub-standard structures or without access to heating. This can lead to frostbite, hypothermia, pneumonia, stroke and heart attack., The destruction of houses and lack of access to fuel or electricity due to damaged infrastructure could become a matter of life or death if people are unable to heat their homes. According to the Government of Ukraine, over 800,000 houses have been damaged or destroyed in the country since the start of the war, and thousands of people are now living either in collective centres or damaged buildings, without the protection they need against the harsh cold season., The coming brutal winter could prove particularly dangerous for vulnerable people - including the elderly, patients with chronic conditions, and maternal and neonatal services, especially given the current reality of low COVID-19 and other vaccines coverage. Indeed, we have seen COVID cases rise sharply in recent weeks, as they have elsewhere in the WHO European Region. We must prepare for an increased burden of respiratory diseases this autumn and winter, as seasonal influenza co-circulates with SARS-CoV-2., Wintertime challenges and the latest escalation in fighting could add to significant internal displacement, with an anticipated 2 to 3 million people on the move within Ukraine itself, as well as another exodus of refugees to surrounding countries., Consequently, there will be an even greater strain on health services both in Ukraine and refugee-receiving countries., Mental health issues will also likely be exacerbated. Earlier this week, on World Mental Health Day, we noted that almost 10 million people at the present time are potentially at risk of mental disorders such as acute stress, anxiety, depression, substance use and post-traumatic stress disorder. This estimate was made before this week’s escalation of hostilities., The fourth priority I’d like to emphasise is the crucial continuation – despite the raging war – of health care reform in Ukraine., Before the war, the country had embarked on an ambitious health care reform process that had already begun showing strong results., However, recent economic analyses from the World Bank suggest the war could push 60 percent of the population below the poverty line, and UNDP estimates put that figure as possibly even higher – making it more and more challenging for people to afford essential medical services. An urgent roadmap is needed to expand universal health coverage in the months and years ahead., I would like to acknowledge here donor governments who make our work possible. WHO’s humanitarian ask, so far, has averaged to about US$ 10 million per month for our response in Ukraine. We need donor support to remain steady, if not increase, to enable, in turn, our support to Ukrainian health partners in the long term and for the health needs of refugees in surrounding countries., We can expand on these and other issues when we take your questions – but let me conclude by reiterating the message I conveyed at the very beginning: WHO is in Ukraine for the long haul. The country and its people can count on our partnership and support, today and always., Thank you very much., ENDS, Contacts:, Roy Wadia, rwadia@who.int, Bhanu Bhatnagar, bbhatnagar@who.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/who-ukraine-long-haul
Ukraine Crisis: 1-7 October 2022,News and Press Release,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,14 Oct 2022,"On 1 October, Ukrainian forces liberated the strategic town of Lyman in the Donetsk region, which Russia had used as a logistics and transport hub for its military operations in northern Donbas (The Guardian, 2 October 2022). Ukrainian forces also continued to advance in the Kharkiv region, wresting control of several settlements around Kupiansk and Borova, and closing in on the administrative border with the Luhansk region. The Ukrainian military command also announced the reclamation of over a dozen towns in the Beryslavskyi district of the Kherson region., Russian forces continued to target civilian infrastructure with shelling and airstrikes last week, killing dozens of civilians. In Zaporizhia, Russian forces shelled residential buildings on 6 October, reportedly killing 17 people (Ukrayinska Pravda, 8 October 2022). Additionally, at least six civilians were reportedly killed and seven injured in landmine explosions in the Kharkiv, Donetsk, Sumy, and Chernihiv regions. Meanwhile, several mass burial sites with the bodies of suspected civilians killed during the Russian occupation were found last week in Lyman and Sviatohirsk (Ukrayinska Pravda, 7 October 2022). As of 6 October, Ukrainian police also claim to have discovered 22 Russian torture chambers throughout the de-occupied Kharkiv region (Centre for Strategic Communications, 6 October 2022)., For more information, including previous infographics and an interactive dashboard, visit our Ukraine Crisis research hub.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-1-7-october-2022
Education App Offers an Escape for Children in Ukraine’s Bomb Shelters,News and Press Release,War Child,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",14 Oct 2022,"As a wave of missiles and rockets descended on Ukraine on Monday, thousands of children and families sought shelter underground reliving the horror they experienced back in February. Despite this desperate picture, a sense of calm and composure is radiating from the subways and bomb shelters - captured best by children playing educational games on mobile and tablet devices., This is the story of Can’t Wait to Learn - a fundamental part of War Child’s Ukraine Response., Taking shelter, No child should be part of war. Ever. Just like no civilians or civilian infrastructure should ever become targets. Yet, on Monday, these basic principles were disregarded as missiles and rockets rained down on schools and homes across Ukraine with 19 people reported dead and 105 injured at the time of writing. From Kharkiv to Lviv, more than 100 missiles have been fired since the escalation in violence started., In the capital Kyiv, a busy playground - known by all the locals - was among the sites first hit. Viktor, a teacher at a primary school in the city, was preparing for his first lesson when the air raid sirens sounded. “Several children had entered the classroom; some were just approaching the school”, he says. “We’ve become so used to the sound of sirens that we knew exactly what to do. I gathered the children and we made our way down into the bomb shelter, expecting to be back in an hour, as usual. But in the end, we had to stay there, in the basement, for over five hours.”, A moment of escape and distraction, During those long hours, while the sounds of the violence lingered in the background, Viktor did everything he could to create an oasis of calm for his pupils. “We sat on the floor playing the Can’t Wait to Learn games on tablets and mobile phones. We solved math problems together. “I’m learning, not waiting” is the motto - and so they did. It also distracted them from what was going on outside and offered an escape when they needed it most.”, And what is Can’t Wait to Learn exactly? Available now to download on IOS and Android, the app is a collection of government-approved educational games that is granting children from Ukraine the opportunity to continue learning - no matter where they are., Launched at the end of September together with key partners, the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine (MESU) and NGO Osvitoria, the app has already seen some 8,770 children continue their learning journey remotely. The aim is to see a total of 70,000 Ukrainian children following the programme by October next year. “In light of the ongoing violence, the government took the decision to transfer all schooling to online - for this week and potentially for much longer”, says Kate Radford, Senior Consultant for Can’t Wait to Learn: Ukraine. “Can’t Wait to Learn was made with this crisis scenario in mind.”, Finding hope, Despite the renewed terror experienced by children and families overnight, Oleksandra Yarova, Communications Lead for War Child’s Ukraine Response and a Ukrainian refugee herself, echoes the same story as Viktor. “We’ve been here before and while it may be horrendous, I find hope in responses such as Can’t Wait to Learn. It’s a small solution that can ultimately have a big impact. This is why we do what we do.”, Yarova also goes on to explain how interventions like Can’t Wait to Learn may be education-focused yet directly contribute to children’s improved mental health and wellbeing. “The math and reading games were co-created with Ukrainian children”, she says. “Meaning, the characters, graphics and stories are familiar and engaging - offering a sense of comfort amidst the chaos around them.”, Schools and hospitals should never be targets, Talking of small solutions to a growing problem, War Child has contextualised its ReachNow Tool for use in Ukraine and neighbouring refugee host countries. This tried-and-tested tool is designed to support community members to identify children and adolescents in need of mental health support and guide them towards pathways to care., This is a firm reminder that civilian objects - especially schools and hospitals - should never be used for military purposes or as targets. War Child and other humanitarian organisations must be able to access these services in order to do their job and protect young lives., Around the world, more than 32 million children have never seen a teacher as a result of armed conflict. Meanwhile, hundreds of schools are used as wartime targets. Can’t Wait to Learn provides a solution to close the education gap for these children.

Russia-Ukraine international armed conflict: ICRC asks for immediate and unimpeded access to all prisoners of war [EN/RU],News and Press Release,ICRC,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,14 Oct 2022,"Geneva (ICRC)—We share the frustration regarding our lack of access to all prisoners of war (POWs) held in the international armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine. We have been working since February to obtain access to check on the conditions and treatment of POWs and keep their families informed about their loved ones. We have been able to visit hundreds of POWs but there are thousands more who we have not been able to see., The Third Geneva Convention obliges parties to an international armed conflict to grant the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) immediate access to all POWs, and the right to visit them wherever they are held., We want to stress that our teams are ready on the ground—and have been ready for months—to visit the Olenivka penal facility and any other location where POWs are held. However, beyond being granted access by high levels of authority, this requires practical arrangements to materialize on the ground. We cannot access by force a place of detention or internment where we have not been admitted., All States have committed to respect the Geneva Conventions. Giving the ICRC access to visit prisoners of war is a legal obligation. It also helps preserve humanity in an international armed conflict that has created immeasurable loss for countless families., Our mission can only be achieved through coordinated efforts with parties to the conflict. And we ask them and the international community to support the role we have been given., Note to editors and producers:, Established in 1863, the ICRC operates worldwide, helping people affected by conflict and armed violence and promoting the laws that protect victims of war. A neutral, independent and impartial organization, its mandate stems from the Geneva Conventions of 1949. it is based in Geneva, Switzerland, and works in more than 100 countries., The ICRC has been working in Ukraine since 2014 with a team of over 600 staff members. Working closely with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society and our Red Cross Red Crescent Movement partners, we are increasing our response to the vast and growing humanitarian needs in Ukraine., For more information, please contact:, Crystal Wells, ICRC Geneva, +41 79 642 8056

FRONTEX: EU external borders in September,News and Press Release,EU,Protection and Human Rights,13 Oct 2022,"In the first nine months of this year, nearly 228 240 irregular entries were detected at the external borders of the European Union, according to preliminary calculations. * This represents an increase of 70% compared with the same period of last year and is the highest total recorded for the first three quarters of the year since 2016., Key developments:, 228 240 irregular entries recorded in first nine months of 2022, highest since 2016, 33 380 irregular entries recorded in September, Western Balkan, Central Mediterranean routes remain most active, Western Mediterranean, Eastern Land Border routes see drops in detections, In September, EU Member States recorded about 33 380 irregular crossings, 25% more than in the same month in 2021., Top migratory routes:, The Western Balkan route continues to be the most active migratory route into the EU with 19 160 detections in September, twice as many as a year ago. The high number of illegal border crossings can be attributed to repeated crossing attempts by migrants already present in the Western Balkans., The pressure also remains high on the Central Mediterranean route with daily arrivals putting strain on the reception capacities in Italy. Frontex supports the Italian authorities with officers for registration and identification of arrivals. In September, about over 7200 irregular crossings were registered on this route, slightly more (5%) than in 2021., People fleeing Ukraine and entering the EU through border crossing points are not part of the figures of illegal entries detected. According to the latest Frontex data, more than 11 million Ukrainian nationals have entered EU from Ukraine since the start of the war. At the same time, a significant number of Ukrainian nationals have returned to their country., Responding to the high migratory pressure, Frontex has more than 2360 standing corps officers and staff at various sections of the EU external border, as well as in Albania, Serbia, Montenegro and Moldova. In total, more than 2 300 standing corps officers and Frontex staff are taking part in various operational activities, In the first nine months of 2022, the number of irregular migrants (~52 700) detected in the Channel surpassed the annual figure for 2021 (~52 000). So far in 2022, this represents a 68% increase on the same period in 2021, including both attempts and crossings in small boats. As the winter approaches, the number of attempts might increase before the sea conditions worsen and make the crossing more dangerous., *The figure includes other less active migratory routes not mentioned in this press release. The final figures may be higher due to delayed reporting., Note: The preliminary data presented in this statement refer to the number of detections of irregular border-crossing at the external borders of the European Union. The same person may attempt to cross the border several times in different locations at the external border.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/frontex-eu-external-borders-september

On 13 October missile attacks were reported over western Lvivska, Rivnenska and Volynska oblasts. No civilian casualties have been reported thus far but humanitarian agencies are closely following developments for potential impacts on civilians. On 12 October, 50 casualties were reported in Ukraine’s controlled areas, with eastern Donetska (20) and south-eastern Zaporizka (15) oblasts the most affected. Meanwhile six civilian casualties were reported in non-Government-controlled areas of Donetska oblast. In central Dnipropetrovska oblast, the city of Nikopol, which has been under continuous shelling since mid-July, reportedly came under attack with the reported use of heavy artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS). Overnight attacks there on Oct 12 reportedly injured one civilian, damaged more than 30 apartment buildings and gas and electricity lines. The city authorities are reportedly clearing the debris and providing shelter materials to residents whose houses were affected. In Mykolaiv city, a missile attack reportedly damaged a five-storey building. Rescuers saved an 11-year-old boy trapped under the rubble for six hours, and the search for seven more people is ongoing. On 12 October the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported that external power to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) had been restored. This was just a few hours after its connection to the grid had been cut for a second time in less than a week. IAEA Director General Raphael Mariano Grossi welcomed the restoration of external power and announced he would travel to Kyiv after his visit to Moscow as part of IAEA’s continuing efforts to establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP.
In New York, with 143 votes in favour and 5 against, the General Assembly adopted a resolution on 12 October declaring as “unlawful” the actions of the Russian Federation in holding so-called referendums and the subsequent attempted annexation of 4 regions of Ukraine. The resolutions demands that Russia “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.” The resolution also welcomes the efforts of the United Nations, Member States and humanitarian organizations to respond to the humanitarian and refugee crisis and supports efforts to de-escalate the current situation and find a peaceful resolution of the conflict through political dialogue, negotiation, mediation and other peaceful means.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-escalation-attacks-across-country-flash-update-no-3-13-october-enruuk

The UN Secretary General, António Guterres, condemned the attacks in a statement., • Attacks have also been levied on key civilian infrastructure, including the energy network, causing large-scale blackouts and leaving people without power. These attacks on infrastructure exacerbate concerns over capacities of IDPs and conflict affected people to cope over the coming winter months., • As areas continue to become newly accessible, the vast scale of the humanitarian needs and the extensive damage to critical infrastructure is becoming apparent. In Lyman in Donetska oblast, the Interior Ministry reported damage to half of the residential buildings, with 10% destroyed completely.

Our country management and security teams are working closely together to continually assess and strengthen our robust security protocols, while continuing to monitor and respond to security developments since our last situation report., In Zaporizka oblast, the situation in and around Zaporizka Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) remains tense, as the settlement and the area near the ZNPP continues to suffer from mortar and artillery fire, as well as consistency of electricity and water supply. On September 6, the the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) published Nuclear Safety, Security and Safeguards in Ukraine, covering the period from April 28 to September 5. In an address on September 12, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi reiterated his call for the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around ZNPP., In Kherson and Kharkiv oblasts, Ukrainian forces have been making gains after launching offensive operations to retake territory lost to the Russians. In some of these recovered areas, Ukrainians have discovered mass burial sites and other evidence of war crimes, with the Ukrainian Ministry of Reintegration reporting that the number of victims in Izyum may exceed those of Bucha. By the end of the month, Ukrainian forces had retaken the town of Lyman, in the north of Donetsk oblast, which Russian forces had been using as a key logistics hub. These advances and other developments have led Russian President Vladimir Putin to announce a new military mobilisation, and to hold a referendum to annex Donetsk,
Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts—a move that was widely condemned by the international community and that could lead to a significant escalation of the war.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-situation-report-22-october-12-2022

In total, 1 494 applications have been received from small and medium-sized agricultural producers requesting a total of 30 120 sleeves for temporary grain storage., Due to high interest among farmers for this support, the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine (MAPF) and the Food and Organization of the United Nations (FAO) are opening a second call for applications for farmers who were unable to apply to the first call. The second call is open until 23 October through the State Agrarian Registry (SAR)., Under the terms of the programme, farmers must have the land area under official cultivation from 100 to 10 000 hectares, and use the received sleeves to store their own harvested products.

The key requirement is that the location of the cultivated lands must be in the government-controlled territories of Ukraine., The selection and verification process of applications to the first call has already started, and in the coming days farmers will receive the confirmation of assistance through the SAR and will be notified of the address of the warehouse from which they should collect their assigned sleeves., The project is implemented jointly by MAPF and FAO, with the generous financial support of Canada, Japan and the Minderoo Foundation totalling USD 60.5 million. It is expected that the programme will cover 30 percent of the national need for the grain storage., Viktoriia Mykhalchuk

"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (1-7 October 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,13 Oct 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, the Russian military invasion of Ukraine continued amid ongoing counteroffensive operations by Ukrainian forces. In Russia, attacks on enlistment offices continued, while artillery fire reportedly targeted regions close to the Ukrainian border. Fighting continued along the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact. In Kyrgyzstan, the government's handling of border disputes sparked demonstrations. The death of Mahsa Amini in Iran continued to drive solidarity rallies across Europe., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the east and the south of the country last week. On 1 October, Ukrainian forces liberated the strategically important town of Lyman in the Donetsk region, which Russia had used as a logistics and transport hub for its military operations in northern Donbas (The Guardian, 2 October 2022). Ukrainian forces also continued to advance in the Kharkiv region, wresting control of several settlements around Kupiansk and Borova from Russian troops, and closing in on the administrative border with the Luhansk region. The Ukrainian military command also announced reclaiming over a dozen towns in the Beryslavskyi district of the southern Kherson region., Russian forces continued to target civilian infrastructure with shelling and airstrikes last week, killing dozens of civilians. In Zaporizhia, Russian forces shelled residential buildings on 6 October, reportedly killing 17 people (Ukrayinska Pravda, 8 October 2022). Additionally, at least six civilians were reportedly killed and seven injured in landmine explosions in the Kharkiv, Donetsk, Sumy, and Chernihiv regions. Meanwhile, several mass burial sites with the bodies of suspected civilians killed during the Russian occupation were found last week in recently liberated Lyman and Sviatohirsk (Ukrayinska Pravda, 7 October 2022). As of 6 October, Ukrainian police also claim to have discovered 22 Russian torture chambers throughout the de-occupied Kharkiv region (Centre for Strategic Communications, 6 October 2022)., In Russia, three military enlistment offices were set on fire last week in the Republic of Tuva and in the Krasnoyarsk and Krasnodar regions, following the announcement of a ""partial mobilization"" on 21 September. Following anti-mobilization demonstrations held between 21-29 September and growing public discontent around the war in Ukraine (ISW, 2 October 2022), allies of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny announced the recreation of a network of headquarters in Russia and recruitment of members and volunteers (Activatica, 4 October 2022). Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation was recognized as an extremist organization in June 2021 and closed down., Meanwhile, governors of the Belgorod and Kursk regions accused Ukrainian forces of shelling villages close to the Ukrainian border, which reportedly resulted in the death of two residents (TV Rain, 3 October 2022; Novaya Gazeta, 6 October 2022)., Ceasefire violations continued along the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact throughout last week, with the majority of armed clashes recorded on 3 October. Additionally, three Azerbaijani civilians and one Armenian civilian were wounded in landmine explosions in the western Tartar and Martuni regions of Azerbaijan and the eastern Gegharkunik region of Armenia. Separately, 17 Armenian prisoners of war that had been captured during the 13-14 September clashes were returned to Armenia on 4 October (168 Hours, 4 October 2022). At the diplomatic level, following the EU Leaders Summit in Prague on 6 and 7 October, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev agreed to recognize the territorial integrities of Armenia and Azerbaijan and deploy an EU civilian observer mission to the Armenia-Azerbaijan border (OC Media, 7 October 2022)., In Kyrgyzstan, protests related to border disputes with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan were held in border regions of the country. Residents of villages bordering Tajikistan organized several protests condemning the Kyrgyz government's actions following clashes between Tajik and Kyrgyz border guards in mid-September. Protesters criticized the removal of several Kyrgyz border posts from disputed territory (Belta, 26 September 2022). They also demanded that the government either increase security and financial support for bordering villages or provide residents with arms for self-defense. Meanwhile, residents of the Osh region protested against the government-announced border deal with Uzbekistan, demanding that the contested Kempir-Abad (Andijan) water reservoir remain on the Kyrgyz side of the border (Eurasianet, 7 October 2022)., The death of Mahsa Amini in Iran continued to spark solidarity rallies across Europe last week for a third consecutive week. Rallies in support of the ongoing Iranian protests and women's rights in Iran were recorded in Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In Switzerland, police used rubber bullets against demonstrators in Bern after one demonstrator tried to enter the Iranian embassy's premises and remove a floating Iranian flag. In Germany, an Iranian citizen carried out an arson attack on the Iranian embassy in Berlin, to show support for Iranians protesting against the Iranian regime following Amini's death (Tagesspiegel, 4 October 2022)., Note: This dashboard automatically updates to cover the latest four weeks of data released by ACLED.

"Atrocity Alert No. 321: Ukraine, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mozambique",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,12 Oct 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., RUSSIAN AIRSTRIKES KILL AND WOUND CIVILIANS ACROSS UKRAINE, On Monday, 10 October, Russian airstrikes hit 20 cities across Ukraine, killing at least 26 people and wounding over 100 others. According to Ukrainian officials, Russian forces launched at least 112 cruise missiles and 37 drones. The bombardment targeted power plants, bridges and civilian infrastructure, and left entire cities without power, water or heat. Strikes in the capital city, Kyiv, landed in tourist sites, next to a children’s playground and in busy intersections during rush hour. Ravina Shamdasani, Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, stressed that, “these strikes may have violated the principles of the conduct of hostilities under international humanitarian law,” adding that intentionally targeting civilians and civilian objects “amounts to a war crime.”, The offensive likely marked the largest aerial assault since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said that, “nearly eight months later, lives and civilian infrastructure are being inexcusably destroyed. Today [10 October] is another day of anguish for the Ukrainian people. As we speak, my colleagues are reporting to me horrifying strikes on urban centers in Kyiv, Dnipro, Lviv, Zaporizhzhia, Chernihiv, Odesa and elsewhere.”, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in an address on 10 October that the strikes were in retaliation for the 8 October bombing of Kerch Straight bridge that connects mainland Russia with Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014 amidst international condemnation. Ukraine has yet to take responsibility for the explosion, but welcomed the damage., The strikes on Ukraine have received international condemnation and calls for de-escalation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appealed to the international community for air defense systems to assist in protecting civilians. In response, members of the G-7 – an inter-governmental political forum comprised of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and United States – released a statement condemning the attacks and recalling that “indiscriminate attacks on innocent civilian populations constitute a war crime.” Prior to the 10 October offensive the UN Human Rights Council-mandated Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine documented evidence of war crimes, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians, torture and sexual and gender-based violence, since the start of the conflict., As the war in Ukraine continues unabated, civilians are paying the ultimate price. Over 7 million Ukrainians have fled to neighboring countries, while another 6.2 million remain internally displaced. Sarah Hunter, Ukraine Expert at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said, “protecting populations in Ukraine from atrocities must be paramount to all political discourse around the conflict. The international community must utilize all avenues to push for an end to this conflict, provide aid for those in need and pursue justice for the thousands of victims and their families.”, UN REPORT FINDS TORTURE “WIDESPREAD” IN DR CONGO, Armed groups, as well as defense and security forces deployed to combat them, have perpetrated “widespread” torture in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), according to a new report published by the UN Joint Human Rights Office (UNJHRO) in the DRC and the peacekeeping operation in the country (MONUSCO). The report covers the period April 2019 to April 2022 and documented at least 3,126 acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, while acknowledging that torture is likely underreported. Members of armed groups committed approximately 1,833 of the cases of torture, while defense and security forces were responsible for 1,293 cases, leading to 2,295 victims, including civilians and captured members of armed groups., The majority of cases of torture were documented in conflict-affected provinces of eastern DRC, including Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu and Tanganyika. Armed groups often committed torture at illegal barriers along main roads, during attacks on homes and displacement sites or during ambushes against civilians suspected of collaborating with the defense and security forces or rival armed groups. UNJHRO documented how torture is also a “frequent practice” in the context of restrictions on democratic and civic space, with human rights defenders and members of civil society working on issues of peace, human rights or health as the primary targets. These cases of torture were accompanied by other violations, including arbitrary arrests and illegal detention., Under international law, torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment are illegal and can amount to a war crime and/or crime against humanity. Acting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Nada Al-Nashif, stressed, “torture can never be justified, no matter the circumstances or the context. The DRC authorities must act with urgency and determination to put an end to this scourge.”, The DRC government has taken some steps to address torture, including ratifying the Additional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and establishing the National Committee for the Prevention of Torture, as well as engaging with the UN Committee against Torture and the Human Rights Council’s Universal Periodic Review to align domestic legislation with international law regarding the prevention and eradication of torture. Despite these efforts and the scale of abuses documented in the latest UNJHRO report, only two army officers, 12 police officers and 75 members of armed groups were convicted of torture during the reporting period., The DRC government must tackle impunity – which has created an environment conducive for torture – by investigating violations and strengthening judicial proceedings. Congolese authorities should implement a survivor-centered approach, including by providing support and redress to victims. UNJHRO and MONUSCO should continue supporting national human rights institutions and implementing technical assistance programs regarding the prevention of torture., FIVE YEARS ON, EXTREME VIOLENCE CONTINUES IN CABO DELGADO, MOZAMBIQUE, Last week marked five years since extreme violence erupted in northern Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado province. Since October 2017 an armed extremist group known locally as “Al-Shabaab” and loosely affiliated with the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has engaged in a violent insurgency concentrated in Cabo Delgado. The group’s campaign has been characterized by attacks against civilians, including beheadings and sexual and gender-based violence, as well as the recruitment of child soldiers and the destruction of civilian infrastructure. Five years on, over 6,200 people have been killed and, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the violence has forcibly displaced nearly 1 million people., After a relative lull in violence between mid-July to late August, attacks escalated during September, spilling over into Nampula province, south of Cabo Delgado. In one particularly violent incident, armed insurgents beheaded at least six people, kidnapped three and burned a church on 6 September in Nampula. Fatal attacks in Ancuabe and Chiure districts, Cabo Delgado, as well as in several villages in Erati and Memba districts, Nampula, destroyed houses and civilian infrastructure, including health facilities. UNHCR estimated that violence in Nampula displaced over 12,000 people during September while local authorities have claimed the number may be closer to 38,600. Those fleeing, the majority of whom were women and children, reported leaving due to attacks or fear of attacks. Since the start of October, members of Al-Shabaab have continued to engage in sporadic raids around Cabo Delgado, beheading civilians and burning buildings., UNHCR Spokesperson, Matthew Saltmarsh, noted that, “extreme violence and displacement have had a devastating impact on the population. People have witnessed their loved ones being killed, beheaded, and raped, and their houses and other infrastructure burned to the ground… The humanitarian situation across Cabo Delgado has continued to deteriorate.” Although UNHCR has determined that Cabo Delgado remains too volatile and dangerous for the safe return of civilians, displaced people have begun returning to their areas of origin in recent weeks., Jaclyn Streitfeld-Hall, Director of Policy and Research at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “despite efforts by regional forces to aid Mozambique in combating Al-Shabaab over the past year, civilians continue to face a heightened risk of atrocities amidst renewed attacks. It is imperative that UNHCR, as well as Mozambique’s security forces and their regional partners enhance their efforts to address growing protection needs and ensure the protection of civilians and displaced persons, including through increasing patrols in areas vulnerable to attack.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/atrocity-alert-no-321-ukraine-democratic-republic-congo-and-mozambique

"With 143 Votes in Favour, 5 Against, General Assembly Adopts Resolution Condemning Russian Federation’s Annexation of Four Eastern Ukraine regions",News and Press Release,UN GA,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,12 Oct 2022,"GA/12458, ELEVENTH EMERGENCY SPECIAL SESSION,, 13TH & 14TH MEETINGS (AM & PM), Continuing its emergency special session, the General Assembly today condemned the Russian Federation’s attempted illegal annexation of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, and demanded it immediately withdraw all its military forces from Ukraine territory., By the terms of the text, titled “Territorial integrity of Ukraine: defending the principles of the Charter of the United Nations” — adopted by a recorded vote of 143 in favour to 5 against (Belarus, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Nicaragua, Russian Federation, Syria) with 35 abstentions — the Assembly demanded that the Russian Federation immediately reverse its decisions of 21 February and 29 September related to the status of the four abovementioned regions., These acts are a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter, the Assembly declared. It called on all States, international organizations and United Nations agencies not to recognize any alteration by the Russian Federation of the status of the four regions of Ukraine., [The Assembly’s eleventh emergency special session resumed on 11 October after the Security Council on 30 September failed to adopt a resolution intended to condemn the Russian Federation referendums that preceded Moscow’s proclamation of its annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. (See Press Release SC/15046 for details.) The draft Council resolution also would have declared that the referendums taken from 23 to 27 September in parts of those regions are neither valid nor form the basis for any alteration of the status of these regions of Ukraine, including any purported annexation by the Russian Federation.], In the discussion today, many Member States deplored the Russian Federation’s aggression towards its neighbour and its attempted annexation of Ukrainian land as blatant disregard for the bedrock principles on which the Organization was founded. The Czech Republic’s representative said the Russian Federation’s organizing of “fake voting amidst the war” is yet more proof of the intimidation and violations Ukrainian citizens are facing., Some speakers were more neutral in their approach, while a handful sided with the Russian Federation. Among them was the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, whose delegate said that the people of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia voted to be a part of the Russian Federation. He also added that illegals acts of aggression against former Yugoslavia, as well as Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, by the United States and other Western countries, have yet to be addressed by the Security Council., The representative of Papua New Guinea expressed dismay that the Russian Federation as a permanent member of the Security Council could threaten nuclear war with such ease. Council members do not solely represent their own interests, but peace and security on a global scale. “Take a hard look at your respective actions and ask whether you deserve a seat,” he said., Several delegations, such as Brazil and India, expressed worries that their concerns and suggestions were not included in the draft text, with Brazil’s representative underscoring that his delegation’s calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities were left out., India joined several other speakers in expressing deep worry that the people of the global South were feeling pain from a food, fuel and fertilizer shortage, and sky-high price increases, as a result of the war., Some delegates stressed the need to promote dialogue and diplomacy so that peace can prevail. They expressed concern that not enough was being done to bring parties to peace talks., The representative of the United States said that the path to peace does not run through placations. The only way to bring peace is to “show what we will not tolerate”, she said., Canada’s delegate dismissed the Russian Federation’s claims of Russophobia. “We do not seek Russia’s destruction; what we seek is for the Russian Federation to live up to its commitment” and to act as a steward of peace, he said., The Russian Federation’s representative reiterated that the populations of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia voted that they did not want to return to Ukraine and that more than 100 international observers from Italy, Germany, Venezuela, Latvia and other countries, who observed the referendum, recognized its outcome as legitimate. He called today’s text a politicized and openly provocative document that risks destroying any efforts towards a diplomatic solution to the crisis., Also speaking today were the representatives of Guatemala, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Ecuador, Slovakia, Republic of Korea, Australia, Chile, Viet Nam, Colombia, Moldova, Federated States of Micronesia, Croatia, Hungary, Spain, Cyprus, Argentina, Portugal, Greece, Liberia, Belgium, Japan, Georgia, Azerbaijan, New Zealand, Slovenia, Uruguay, Syria, Montenegro, Ghana, Cambodia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Palau, Timor-Leste, Germany, France, China, Venezuela, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Angola, Algeria, South Africa, Pakistan, Egypt, Bangladesh, Thailand, Mauritius, Brazil, Cuba and Bolivia, as well as the Permanent Observers for the Holy See and the Sovereign Order of Malta., A representative of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance also spoke., The representatives of Rwanda, Pakistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo made statements in exercise of the right of reply., The Assembly will meet again at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 October, to consider the tenth annual report of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals., Statements, JUAN ANTONIO BENARD ESTRADA (Guatemala) said that beyond the systematic abuses committed by the Russian Federation against the people of Ukraine, acts of annexation by the Russian Federation of Ukraine’s territories are null, and violate international law and the Charter of the United Nations. He condemned the Russian Federation’s attacks on residential areas, urging the Security Council to respond to this “growing threat”. Guatemala did not hesitate to express its support for the Ukrainian people. Today’s resolution does not favour a unipolar world, he said. Rather, it is an appeal to defend the United Nations Charter. Guatemala is a State that recognizes the critical importance of dialogue and diplomacy, he said, adding that its Constitution prioritizes respect for human rights., FERGAL TOMAS MYTHEN (Ireland) condemned the Russian Federation’s attempts to illegally annex the Ukrainian regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, and its holding of illegal, illegitimate and sham referendums. Such actions are another blatant breach of the United Nations Charter and do not represent the freely expressed will of the people in those regions, he said. Ireland, he continued, remains fully committed to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders. Describing the Russian Federation’s veto as a “reprehensible attempt to excuse its own military aggression against Ukraine, a fellow member of our United Nations,” he reiterated the call to abolish the veto. He then called on the Russian Federation to immediately cease hostilities, unconditionally withdraw from the entire territory of Ukraine and refrain from further threats of the use of force of any kind, including nuclear weapons., MAURIZIO MASSARI (Italy), associating himself with the statement delivered by the European Union, deplored the Russian Federation’s sham referendum, which he said blatantly violates international law. He urged the Russian Federation to put an end to its military aggression and genuinely commit to diplomatic dialogue. “Russia needs to stop immediately this senseless war,” he said, which is hitting the most vulnerable people in Ukraine and beyond. He urged all Member States to stand together to resist the Russian Federation’s aggression and together uphold the United Nations Charter., CORNEL FERUȚĂ (Romania), aligning himself with the European Union, stressed that the Russian Federation’s actions in organizing the illegal referendums in four Ukrainian regions under occupation, and subsequently attempting to annex them, are attempts by the Kremlin to justify its illegal military occupation. Also strongly condemning this morning’s missile attacks against civilian objectives in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, he added that the international community has a legal obligation not to recognize any alteration of the status of the Ukrainian regions concerned. “Let us be clear, Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Crimea and Sevastopol are Ukraine,” he said, adding that the draft resolution under consideration defends the United Nations Charter and represents a building block for peace., LACHEZARA STOEVA (Bulgaria), aligning herself with the European Union, said that on Monday, the Russian Federation’s armed forces killed 12 civilians. Attacks against civilians are prohibited under international humanitarian law and constitute war crimes, she said, condemning the Russian Federation’s illegal annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia following the so-called illegal referendums. Her country will never recognize it, just as it never recognized the illegal annexation of Crimea, she said, adding that such actions not only undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty but also dismantle the existing world order. This war must end now and the Russian Federation must end it by immediately withdrawing all military forces from the territory of Ukraine, she said, cautioning delegates: “Today it is Ukraine, tomorrow it could be any one of us.”, CRISTIAN ESPINOSA CAÑIZARES (Ecuador) rejected the use of force by one State against another and said his Government does not recognize the acquisition of territory by force. He rejected the referendums held by the Russian Federation in territories of Ukraine under foreign military occupation, stressing that these referendums lack legal validity and violate international law. He appealed to the Russian Federation to withdraw its troops from Ukraine’s territories and reiterated Ecuador’s support for endeavours that promote diplomatic solutions., MICHAL MLYNÁR (Slovakia), associating himself with the statement delivered by the European Union, expressed outrage that despite calls from the majority of States, the Russian Federation is escalating its assault on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Ukraine is an independent, sovereign State. The so-called referendums in areas under the Russian Federation’s occupation cannot be called the “true expression of the will of the people”, he said. Slovakia will continue to provide support to Ukraine in its “just struggle” to pursue sovereignty and territorial integrity. “It is the Russian Federation that started the war, and it is only the Russian Federation that can end it — and it should be done immediately and without delay,” he stressed. Perpetrators of crimes committed in Ukraine should be held to account. He appealed to every delegation to vote in favour of today’s draft resolution. The international community must send a clear signal that such behaviour cannot and should not be tolerated. This is not a vote between Ukraine and the Russian Federation but “between the power of law and the power of force”, he said., JOONKOOK HWANG (Republic of Korea) said the international community has continuously condemned the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine. “Unfortunately, Russia has not answered the calls of the international community,” he added, reiterating his support for the sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The Republic of Korea cannot accept the Russian Federation’s attempt to divide Ukraine. The core values of the United Nations are at stake today, he warned. The Russian Federation’s illegal actions should not be accepted nor tolerated. He said that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was the only country that has expressed support for the Russian Federation’s annexation of Ukraine’s territory. Nations must unite to overcome threats to international peace and security., MITCHELL FIFIELD (Australia), noting that his country is proud to join all Member States that are determined to uphold the Charter, stressed that the sham referendums in the occupied areas of Ukraine have no legal effect. Describing them as a dangerous escalation and urging all Member States to support the resolution under consideration, he said his country will continue to stand with the brave people of Ukraine. Noting that his country responded to the annexation with travel bans and financial sanctions, he called on the Russian Federation to comply with its obligations under the Charter. Paying tribute to the remarkable courage of the Ukrainian people, he called for a peace that is not just an absence of war but one that enables them to live freely., Ms. OJEDA TAPIA (Chile), recalling that Article 2 of the United Nations Charter states that all Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any States, added that the Charter also calls for resolution of disputes by peaceful means. Reaffirming commitment to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, she rejected the illegal referendums held in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The international community must not remain indifferent to this illegal annexation, she said, also noting the efforts being undertaken by many stakeholders to resolve the matter peacefully., DANG HOANG GIANG (Viet Nam) recalled his own country’s history with its decades of war. Since the foundation of the United Nations, Member States had unfortunately witnessed many acts of aggression. Viet Nam aims to promote friendly relations among neighbours. “It is with a heavy heart that we have been following the situation in Ukraine,” he said, reiterating his call for the immediate cessation of hostilities and earliest resumption of dialogue. It is important to ensure the safety and security of civilians, as well as of critical infrastructure. Peace and stability of the entire world is at stake, he said, calling on international partners to provide aid to people in need. Efforts must be laser-focused on de-escalation., SONIA MARINA PEREIRA PORTILLA (Colombia) reiterated her country’s rejection of war and violence under any circumstance, and urged parties to the conflict to seek a negotiated and peaceful solution., JAKUB KULHÁNEK (Czech Republic), associating himself with the statement delivered by the European Union, said Russian Federation President Vladimir V. Putin’s regime once again flagrantly violates international law and European security. Changing Ukraine’s borders “absolutely has no validity”. He urged all Member States to reject the Russian Federation’s illegal annexation of Ukraine’s territory. Organizing “fake voting amidst the war” is yet more proof of the intimidation and violations Ukrainian citizens are facing. He expressed support for the establishment of an international tribunal to hold to account perpetrators and violators of international law in Ukraine., SONG KIM (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) stressed the crucial role of the right to self-determination, adding that the people of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia have the right to decide their international political status at their own discretion. The people of those regions have exercised their right through a referendum held from 23 to 27 September 2022, he said, adding that his country respects their will. They aspire to integration into the Russian Federation, he said, adding that the United Nations Charter and international law must not be applied in a selective and partial manner. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of former Yugoslavia, as well as Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, were violated brutally by the United States and other Western countries, he said, adding that such unlawful and illegal acts have never been called into question in the Security Council., GHEORGHE LEUCĂ (Moldova), aligning himself with the European Union, said that the Russian Federation’s unprovoked war of aggression has triggered the largest refugee crisis in Europe since the end of the Second World War, prompted global food shortages and deepened the European energy crisis. Also pointing to reports of massive human rights violations, he condemned the massive missile attacks conducted recently against civilian infrastructure in Ukrainian cities. Further, airspace-monitoring data shows that free-cruise missiles launched from the Russian Federation’s military ships in the Black Sea have crossed his country’s airspace, he said, condemning this serious risk to the security of Moldova. His country will not recognize the illegal referendums conducted by the Russian Federation, he stressed, expressing support for the draft resolution., JEEM LIPPWE (Federated States of Micronesia), associating himself with the Pacific Islands Forum, said he did not recognize the so-called referendums held by the Russian Federation in the four occupied regions of Ukraine. The annexation of Ukrainian territory by the Russian Federation violates the principles of international law. For the abovementioned reasons, his delegation would vote in favour of today’s resolution, he said., IVAN ŠIMONOVIĆ (Croatia), associating himself with the statement delivered by the European Union, expressed concern that tens of thousands of people have died and that the “crimes committed are piling up”. The annexation of the temporarily occupied territories in Ukraine is null and void, he said, urging Member States to reject and condemn the action. “By doing so, we are not only protecting Ukraine, but the UN Charter,” he said. The Russian Federation continues to violate and blatantly ignore international law. He asked: What kind of “greed” is inciting the leadership of the largest country in the world to annex the land of its neighbour? A “yes” vote for today’s resolution is a just vote for Ukraine., ZSUZSANNA HORVÁTH (Hungary), associating herself with the statement delivered by the European Union, rejected and condemned the illegal annexation of Ukraine’s territories. “We will never recognize the illegal referenda,” she said. Ukraine has the right to liberate occupied territories. The United Nations Charter is not optional. If one Member State decides to disregard international law, others may follow. Violations by the Russian Federation are unacceptable and must be called out. Any use or threat of use of weapons of mass destruction is contrary to various international instruments and agreements. “A nuclear war cannot be won and therefore must never be fought,” she said. Too many Member States are finding themselves faced with myriad crises: cost of living, energy, food and climate change. Uncertainty and political upheaval are growing. The war constitutes a great security risk. The ensuing rise in the cost of food and fuel is a real and concerning challenge. “Our continent is facing its most severe energy crisis,” she said, calling for dialogue and diplomacy. “We have to use whatever tool available for peace,” she added., AGUSTÍN SANTOS MARAVER (Spain), aligning himself with the European Union, condemned the sham referendums held in parts of Ukrainian territory temporarily under the Russian Federation’s military control. The Russian Federation persists in its flagrant violations of international law, he said, adding that the international community will never recognize these illegal annexation attempts. Reaffirming respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, he appealed for an immediate ceasefire and expressed support for the efforts of Member States and the Secretary-General towards de-escalation. Noting that the Russian Federation’s veto paralysed the Council at a time when that country is threatening to use nuclear weapons, he said such actions undermine global peace., ANDREAS HADJICHRYSANTHOU (Cyprus), associating himself with the European Union, condemned the illegal referendums held in the occupied regions of Ukraine and the subsequent attempts at annexing them. International law is clear that boundaries cannot be altered by use of force, he said, adding that a referendum cannot take place unilaterally without the consent of the Government of the territory, and that it is not an exercise of the right to self-determination. States have a legal duty to withhold recognition of such acts, he said, noting that his own country has been divided for 50 years due to the crime of aggression. Stressing the role of multilateralism in maintaining international peace and security, he said that diplomacy and not war is the solution., MARÍA DEL CARMEN SQUEFF (Argentina) said her country is against the acquisition of territories by force. The Russian Federation must immediately cease its military aggression in Ukraine. The attempted referendums and subsequent annexation are null and void and have no standing in international law. She underscored the need to reach a solution so that a political dialogue can take place. The recent pandemic, climate change and the displacement of millions of people around the world have demonstrated that the international community has enough urgent problems to confront, she said, pointing out that war is something that the United Nations had committed to relegate to the past., ANA PAULA BAPTISTA GRADE ZACARIAS (Portugal), associating herself with the European Union, said the Russian Federation’s attempt to annex Ukraine’s territories is null and void. Ukraine has a right to self-defence in the face of ongoing aggression. “No security concern can ever be a legitimate reason to invade a neighbouring country,” she said. The global impact of the conflict is of real concern. The Russian Federation must stop this war and withdraw from Ukraine, she said, stressing that it is critical to uphold a rules-based international order., MARIA THEOFILI (Greece), associating herself with the European Union, said the United Nations Charter is clear. Respect for the territorial integrity of all countries is the cornerstone of international law. This is the foundation of international order. Violations of international law, no matter whom they target, are “a threat to us all”, she said. Greece will spare no effort to protect the Greek community in Ukraine, she said, adding that justice must be carried out and crimes against humanity held to account. Greece will vote in favour of today’s draft text., CECILIA FORGBE MC GILL (Liberia), noting that this is an unprecedented moment in international history, condemned the Russian Federation’s sham referendums and annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia as a flagrant violation of the Charter and international law. Article 2 of the Charter prohibits the use or threat of use of force, she noted, condemning the violence and intimidation taking place in Ukraine. That country deserves the support of the international community in all its efforts to maintain its sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence, she said, stressing that Member States must make all efforts to prevail upon the invading nation to cease all its hostilities., FILIP DE MAESSCHALCK (Belgium), associating himself with the European Union, said that his country “understands the value of multilateralism” and is aware of the shared heritage among all Member States. The consequences of the Russian Federation’s illegal violent actions are unfortunately being experienced by all members of the Organization, he said, noting its impact on sustainable development, food security and global energy supply. Pointing to the increasing number of human rights violations, he said that on Monday, towns and densely populated areas where civilians were living were bombed indiscriminately. “’The protection of civilians’ are mere words for the aggressor,” he said., ISHIKANE KIMIHIRO (Japan) condemned the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine, including recent missile attacks against cities across the country, which led to the deaths of innocent civilians. The attempted illegal annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions clearly breaches the Charter and international law, he said, adding that the General Assembly must not accept such outrageous actions. Further, such unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force shake the very foundation of the international order, he said, adding that while the Security Council has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace, it failed to act because of the veto cast by the Russian Federation., DAVID BAKRADZE (Georgia), associating himself with the European Union delegation, said the Russian Federation has continued to disregard calls from resolutions adopted in the General Assembly. He reiterated Georgia’s support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. As a state that in 2008 witnessed the Russian Federation’s aggression first-hand, he said Georgia wanted to share a vital message: “Time matters, words matter.” They matter for future generations and for the United Nations in tackling global challenges. It is the collective responsibility of the international community to defend the principles of the United Nations Charter, he underscored., YASHAR T. ALIYEV (Azerbaijan) said he did not recognize the results of the so-called referendums held in Ukraine’s territories. His country reiterated that strict compliance with the norms and principles of international law is critical to the maintenance of international peace and stability., JUSTIN PETER FEPULEAI (New Zealand), stressing that the sham referendums in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are illegitimate and have no legal basis, said they are a clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity. Annexing the territory of another State through force qualifies as an act of aggression, he added. The international community has an obligation to speak up when there is a violation of international law, he said, adding that the Secretary-General has been very clear that the Russian Federation’s actions have no basis in any international legal framework. The Russian Federation must comply with the legally binding orders of the International Court of Justice to immediately suspend its military operations in Ukraine, he said., BOŠTJAN MALOVRH (Slovenia), aligning himself with the European Union, denounced the Russian Federation’s threats to use nuclear weapons. Civilians, the vast majority of whom are women and children, are often the main victims in armed conflicts, he noted, underscoring that the shelling of residential buildings as well as other civilian infrastructure represents a severe violation of international law. Calling on the Russian Federation to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access and assistance to all persons in need, he expressed support for all efforts to de-escalate the current situation through political dialogue and negotiation. Slovenia is committed to the promotion of a culture of peace and dialogue, he said, expressing support for the current draft resolution., CARLOS AMORÍN (Uruguay) said his country did not recognize the annexation by the Russian Federation of Ukrainian territories. “These referenda are in clear violation of international law,” he added. Uruguay reiterates its support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and calls on the Russian Federation to cease its aggression. He also underscored the importance of diplomacy in helping resolve the conflict., FRED SARUFA (Papua New Guinea) said his delegation continues to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. “For us, this is the right thing to do,” he said. How many more General Assembly and Security Council meetings must be convened to end the aggressive actions of the Russian Federation, he asked. This cannot and must not be allowed to continue. The destructive socioeconomic impacts of the Russian Federation’s war in Ukraine are many. He further condemned the annexation of Ukraine’s territories, expressing dismay that a permanent member of the Security Council could threaten nuclear war with such ease. He applauded the seven Council members who “stood up” for peace and security, but expressed disappointment that some members of the Council “have yet again failed us”. Council members do not only represent their own interests, but peace and security on a global scale. “Take a hard look at your respective actions and ask whether you deserve a seat,” he said., BASSAM SABBAGH (Syria) said the rostrum of the General Assembly is being manipulated by Western countries for their own interests, as demonstrated by the request for this resumed special emergency session. Describing the draft resolution as hostile towards the Russian Federation, he said Member States have not had the opportunity to introduce amendments to the text. That constitutes clear proof that these countries want to take a hostile stance against the Russian Federation, he said. Such a provocative approach shows that they are trying to fuel the conflict and to push neo-Nazism in Ukraine to one side, rather than resolving issues through dialogue and negotiation. He condemned Western States for ”whipping things up against the Russian Federation through fake information, false news and falsified images”., DRAGANA ŠĆEPANOVIĆ (Montenegro), aligning herself with the European Union, said that international peace and security have been endangered to an extent never seen in the post-Second World War period, by the Russian Federation’s unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine. “The fact that a permanent member of the Security Council and a nuclear State exercised brutal force breaching the territorial integrity and sovereignty of its neighbouring country should make everyone’s blood run cold,” she said. Rejecting the Russian Federation’s attempted illegal annexation of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, she said the terror and violence that the people of Ukraine are exposed to must stop immediately. “Russia will not stop in Ukraine,” she said, adding that her country is again experiencing “Russian spying and other destabilizing malign activities”., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana) said that commitment to the United Nations Charter is not a passive duty, but the war against Ukraine has challenged its most basic principles. The international community has a responsibility to help the parties come to peace talks. All Member States have rights, no matter how small they are, he said, underscoring Ukraine’s right to sovereignty and territorial integrity. He stressed that the Russian Federation’s annexation of Ukrainian territories is “null and void”. The Russian Federation’s attempt to use historical wrongdoing to justify current action is unacceptable. The war in Ukraine must end now, he said, emphasizing the need to prioritize the safety of civilians. The Russian Federation must withdraw its forces from the internationally recognized border of Ukraine., SOVANN KE (Cambodia), in explaining his co-sponsorship and “yes” vote for the resolution, urged all Member States to respect and adhere to the principles and values of the United Nations. Annexation of regions from a sovereign country is a flagrant violation of the Charter, he said. He called for all parties to resolve the conflict peacefully, urging them to ensure the safe passage of civilians and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance in and around Ukraine., GEORGES NZONGOLA-NTALAJA (Democratic Republic of the Congo) said that while his delegation voted in favour of the resolution, it deplores “the politics of double standards of the powerful of this world when it comes to Africa”. Much has been spent on Ukraine during the last eight months, but very little attention is paid to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where more than 7 million people have died and thousands more suffer in internally displaced persons camps. He recalled that Rwanda and Uganda invaded his country in 1998, and that Rwanda continues to plunder its natural resources, occupying several places in North-Kivu province. Yet no strong action has been taken by the international community. Neither the Security Council nor the General Assembly have adopted resolutions to impose sanctions on Rwanda, he said., ILANA VICTORYA SEID (Palau), associating herself with the Asia Pacific Forum, condemned the Russian Federation’s aggression, “sham referenda” and attempt to annex Ukrainian territories. Adding that the war has had widespread consequences, she said children and families are going hungry from food inflation. Moreover, in countries like Palau, people are dealing with soaring temperatures, unable to cool their homes as energy prices shoot through the roof. In other countries, families will suffer a frigid winter, she said, stressing that those who are most vulnerable will get hit the hardest. Addressing Member States who have remained neutral on the Russian Federation’s aggression, she urged them to uphold the principles of the United Nations Charter and the notion that nations simply cannot and should not redraw borders., KARLITO NUNES (Timor-Leste), highlighting the international community’s moral obligation to defend sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity, said that upholding the international rule-based order is not an option; it is a must. Expressing concern about the eight months of killing and destruction, he quoted the French Philosopher, Jean-Paul Sartre, who said, “When the rich make war, it’s the poor that die.” Peace is possible, he stressed, adding that the Russian Federation and Ukraine are “brothers and neighbours.” Calling upon all countries to help the two States build peace and live harmoniously side by side, he quoted his country’s President, who said in his address to the General Assembly that the Russian Federation, Ukraine and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries must swallow their pride, review past policies that led to this mutual suicide and back away from each other’s borders., MICHAEL ALEXANDER GEISLER (Germany), recalling that the United Nations was created to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, said that a permanent member of the Security Council has now brought it back. The Russian Federation’s playbook is simple, he said, adding that the country has seized land and then organized a referendum to secure its land grab. Further, it does not shy away from nuclear threats against a country that has voluntarily given up its nuclear arsenal, he pointed out. Asking the Russian Federation’s Government if it still subscribes to the January 3 2022 declaration by the leaders of all five nuclear-weapon States reaffirming that a nuclear war must never be fought, he stressed: “Today it is Ukraine; tomorrow it could be any of us.” The sham referendum and the Russian Federation’s illegal annexation are null and void, he stressed., ANNIKA SILVA-LEANDER, a representative of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, called the Russian Federation’s referenda a violation of international law. The referenda were also conducted in gross violation of international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Her Institute called on the international community to condemn these actions as illegal. She deplored the Russian Federation’s “use and abuse” of the veto power in the Security Council, which calls for a profound reform of the body in ensuring it can truly uphold peace and security. Those in the Assembly who would support Ukraine’s reconstruction process should do so with democracy at the forefront of all action. She welcomed the adoption and enforcement of sanctions on the Russian Federation., ROBERT KEITH RAE (Canada) said the reality and truth are clear. The Russian Federation’s war goes against the principles that lie at the heart of the United Nations Charter. Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin would have the world believe that there is some kind of conspiracy against his country. But the West did not create the Charter. “The Soviet Union signed the Charter; China signed the Charter,” he said. There is no grand conspiracy against the Russian Federation. “The international community is not anti-Russia,” he said. Rather it is anti-launching an illegal and disastrous invasion of Ukraine. “Apparently, imperial habits die a very hard death,” he continued. There is no Russophobia. The Russian Federation’s own soldiers, tanks and military are abusing Russian-speaking areas. It is the Russian Federation that has twice violated Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity since 2014. The Russian Federation claims it is a friend of the Charter. “We do not seek Russia’s destruction; what we seek is for the Russian Federation to live up to its commitment under the United Nations Charter” and to act as a steward of peace, he said. The responsibility of the Security Council permanent members is to preserve international peace and security. Think of how much better the world could be if Member States were debating in this chamber “how we can rebuild and how we can remake economies that have been impacted by the cascade of devastation” of the last several years, he said., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) said that the current debate is about defending the Charter, the cement that binds the Organization. By attacking Ukraine, the Russian Federation has not only unleashed a war with global repercussions, but also violated the most basic principles of international law. What is happening today in Europe could happen in Asia or Africa or Latin America tomorrow, he cautioned, adding that his country will never resign itself to a world in which force overrides law. Stressing that France would never recognize the fake referenda, he added that it worked with partners in a transparent and inclusive process to draft a text that everyone should be able to support., GENG SHUANG (China), noting that, after eight months of the crisis, a peaceful settlement is not in sight, added that this has led to increased uncertainty in an already turbulent world. At the recently concluded high-level general debate of the Assembly, leaders from around the world called on the parties to cease fighting, he said, stressing the role of dialogue. Also underscoring the importance of increasing humanitarian relief and minimizing the spillover effects of the conflict, he said that abandoning the cold war mentality is crucial. Emphasizing that any action taken by the Assembly should be conducive to a political solution, he added that the draft resolution under consideration will not help achieve that. His delegation would therefore abstain from the vote, he said, adding that the Assembly’s work should be conducted in full accordance with rules of procedure., LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said the draft resolution is not only important to the future of Ukraine and Europe, but the very foundation of the United Nations. The facts are clear: a Member State, one with a permanent seat on the Security Council, has attempted to annex territory from its neighbour. One country cannot take the territory of another by force. Eight years ago, the General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution affirming Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. “Believe me, there is nothing we would like to see more than peace,” she said, adding: “We would also like to stop seeing Russia commit war crimes.” The path to peace does not run through placations and does not involve turning the other way in the face of flagrant violations, she said. The only way to bring peace is for the international community to show what it will not tolerate. “These United Nations will not tolerate seizing a neighbour’s land by force and the destruction of the United Nations Charter,” she said. Today’s resolution makes clear that the Organization rejects the Russian Federation’s affront to territorial integrity and sovereignty. The United States will vote in favour on the resolution and urges every country to do the same. “Let us condemn Russia for its attempt at illegal annexation,” she said., GABRIELE CACCIA, Permanent Observer for the Holy See, reiterated pleas to end the conflict which destroys by the hour the mutual trust on which the international order depends. He underscored Pope Francis’ pleas for an immediate cessation of hostilities. Having directly addressed both the leaders of the Russian Federation and Ukraine, Pope Francis believes all countries must do everything they can to promote and support initiatives for dialogue. They must also refrain from escalation hostilities. With the lingering threat of nuclear escalation, the need for dialogue is even more urgent, he stressed., PAUL BERESFORD-HILL, Permanent Observer for the Sovereign Order of Malta, said that no nation can allow this conflict to spiral out of control because, no matter how far away, “the detritus of burning rage” will consume the entire world. The Order is a sovereign entity that seeks to embrace as its citizens those who are left behind, “the forgotten people of our world, often stateless, homeless, the trafficked, the migrant and refugee”, he said. Appealing for a cessation of hostilities on behalf of innocent civilians suffering through no fault of their own, he pointed to the many human consequences of the crisis: a father crying over a wife killed during a missile attack; an elderly woman crippled and confined to bed, while gunfire rages outside her flat; a mother laying to rest her only son, a soldier killed in battle; a child bereft of its parents, clutching a broken doll. When the innocent see no way out of their pain, then the international community fails the United Nations Charter, he said, adding “we are better than that”., Action, Speaking in explanation of vote before the vote, the representative of the Russian Federation said that the tallies of the referenda held in Luhansk, Donetsk, Kerson and Zaporizhzhia show that the vast majority of those who voted supported the idea of these regions becoming a part of his country. Despite the difficult security situation due to “the provocations of the Kyiv regime”, the populations of these regions voted that they do not want to return to Ukraine. More than 100 international observers from Italy, Germany, Venezuela, Latvia and other countries who observed the referenda recognized its outcome as legitimate, he said. The draft resolution under consideration, he added, is a politicized and openly provocative document that not only ignores all of these facts, but also could destroy any efforts towards a diplomatic solution to the crisis. By introducing this draft, he continued, Western States are pursuing their own geopolitical goals and are again “trying to use the members of the General Assembly as bit players”. Their expressions of commitment to the international law are vivid examples of hypocrisy, he said., Also explaining his vote before the vote, the representative of Venezuela said there were no consultations on today’s draft text, which shows the lack of interest in forging consensus on the resolution. This method of work will not bring Member States closer to achieving peace. “We now find ourselves at a moment of greater confrontation,” he said. Today, the role must be to correct course and prevent a chain reaction that could lead to the abyss. “We are getting closer and closer to the point of no return,” he added. This is not the time to instrumentalize the General Assembly, he warned, urging Member States to do their part in reducing tensions. Nuclear war does not have winners and losers. It ensures mutual destruction and suffering for all the people of the world. Today’s draft will not contribute to furthering international peace and security, he said, also warning against continuing a war that could generate consequences which could hurt generations to come., The representative of Nepal said the conflict in Ukraine is deeply concerning. The United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that all Member States must settle disputes through peaceful means while upholding the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Nepal will vote in favour of the draft resolution today, he said., The representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines said her delegation will vote in favour of the draft resolution, expressing concern about the recent referenda and subsequent annexation. The manner in which the referenda were conducted was not in accordance with international norms, she said, adding that it is a violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. She called for mature diplomacy, adding that the world cannot afford another catastrophic conflict., The Assembly then decided that, in accordance with Article 18 of the Charter, a two-thirds majority of members present and voting is required for the adoption of draft resolution A/ES/11/L.5., The Assembly then adopted the text by a recorded vote of 143 in favour to 5 against (Belarus, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Nicaragua, Russian Federation, Syria), with 35 abstentions., The representative of Saudi Arabia, speaking in explanation of vote after the vote, and on behalf of the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, said he voted in favour of the draft resolution because the group is committed to upholding the principles in the Charter of the United Nations. All countries must abstain from the use of force, he added. The Gulf Cooperation Council hopes that work will continue until a satisfactory solution is reached before any further political and economic repercussions., The representative of Angola, also explaining her vote after the vote, said her country voted in favour of the resolution in accordance with the well-founded principle of territorial integrity, which is also in line with the Constitutive Act of the African Union. In spotlighting the countless human casualties and consequences for world peace and security, as well as economies, she reiterated her country’s appeal for parties to cease hostilities and strive for the peaceful resolution of the conflict through dialogue and in full respect of international law., The representative of Algeria, expressing great concern over the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine, reaffirmed his country’s commitment to international law and the United Nations Charter, particularly respect for the sovereignty of States and opposition to the annexation of territories by force. He called on the international community and the United Nations to discharge their responsibilities, fully end double standards and work on ending all forms of occupation and annexation by force of territories on the Organization’s agenda for decades, particularly Palestine, the occupied Syrian Golan and Western Sahara., The representative of South Africa said that the detrimental effects of the war are being felt around the world. The territorial integrity of States, including Ukraine, is sacrosanct, she said, calling on parties to respect international law. In the context of heightened tensions, all efforts should be geared to a political solution, she said, adding that some elements of the resolution do not address this. Any additional resolutions should focus on concrete proposals to end the war, she stressed., The representative of Pakistan said that his delegation abstained from the vote. The right to self-determination applies to people under foreign or colonial occupation and those who have not exercised that right, as in the case of Jammu and Kashmir, he said. “We look forward to seeing similar concern and condemnation” regarding India’s annexation of illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir, he said, adding that while his delegation agrees that the referendums cannot be conducted on people who are part of a sovereign State, the draft includes provisions that it cannot endorse. Irrespective of the origin of the conflict, the highest priority is the immediate cessation of hostilities through negotiation or mediation, he said., The representative of Egypt said his delegation voted for the draft resolution. Egypt reiterates its call to the parties in the conflict to put an end to hostilities and contain the negative impact on civilians. “Where would we be if we stopped and listened to each other?” he asked, adding that the world would benefit from more understanding and dialogue. Egypt refuses to accept double standards, which will lead to a system that is unable to resolve disputes between parties. He also underscored the food and fuel crises facing developing countries., The representative of India expressed deep concern for the conflict in Ukraine and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities. “The global order we all subscribe to” is based on the territorial integrity of all States, she said. India stands ready to support all efforts aimed at de-escalation. It is unfortunate that as the war unfolds, the entire global South continues to suffer food, fuel and fertilizer shortages, as well as price hikes. She said there were other pressing issues at play, some of which had not been addressed in the text. Her delegation abstained from the vote for that reason, she said, adding that India is on the side of peace and will remain firmly there. Before concluding she addressed the remarks of the delegate of Pakistan, stressing that Jammu and Kashmir are and will continue to be an integral part of India., The representative of Bangladesh said his country voted in favour of the resolution, reaffirming its belief that respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and peaceful settlement of all disputes must be universally complied to, without any exception. He underscored the need for the international community to take similar stands against the annexation of Palestinian and other Arab lands by Israel. Adding that antagonisms like war, economic sanctions and countersanctions can bring no good to any nation, he encouraged dialogue and mediation to solve crises and disputes, urging parties to refrain from action that may further endanger peace and security., The representative of Thailand said that his “small, sovereign nation” holds international law and the Charter sacred, but his delegation chose to abstain from the vote because of the volatile and charged atmosphere. Expressing concern that this marginalizes the chance of diplomacy to bring about a negotiated solution to the crisis, he cautioned against the politicization of international principles, and called for constructive engagement., The representative of Mauritius said his delegation voted in favor of the resolution because it respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations, big and small. Expressing concern about the global consequences of the crisis, he noted that selectivity in applying principles can affect the credibility of the United Nations., The representative of Brazil said international law and the United Nations Charter must be respected and preserved. As much as facilitators of today’s text showed flexibility, Brazil’s calls for a cessation of hostilities and return to dialogue were not included. “We must avoid the crystallization of disputes,” he said. Brazil is deeply concerned with the threat of nuclear weapons, he emphasized, adding that any use of nuclear weapons would be catastrophic for humanity. His delegation abstained from the vote., The representative of Cuba said that countries of the global South are being forced to live under the rules of Western Powers, adding that double standards and political manipulation damage the cause of peace. It is an act of “supreme hypocrisy” that those most responsible for violating the United Nations Charter now proclaim themselves to be the defenders of it. Cuba supports the peaceful resolution of conflict, he said, expressing concern over the absence of calls to de-escalate the conflict. “It is our responsibility to reduce tensions, not increase them,” he said. “We will not achieve peace by promoting confrontation.” He said Cuba’s delegation abstained from the vote., The representative of Bolivia, rejecting the use of aggression to resolve conflicts between States, said the international community must work together to make the world a zone of peace. Expressing concern about the escalation of violence in the military conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine, he said this has led to instability around the world. Noting the prevalence of double standards, with many speaking about promoting peace while supplying weapons that worsen the crisis, he called for the establishment of a high-level committee, with members acceptable to all parties to the conflict, in order to find a political solution. Bolivia abstained from the vote, he said, stressing that the Assembly must promote a genuine platform for dialogue and peace., Right of Reply, The representative of Rwanda, speaking in exercise of the right of reply, said that the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s representative misused the meeting to spread baseless propaganda. Rwanda is fully committed to working with that country within existing frameworks on various matters, including the dignified return of Congolese refugees who have stayed in neighboring countries for too long, he said., The representative of Pakistan, exercising his right of reply in response to India’s remarks, said that Jammu and Kashmir are not a so-called part of India, nor is it India’s internal matter. “India remains in occupation of an internationally recognized disputed territory,” he said, adding that its final disposition must be decided in accordance with the democratic principle of a free and impartial plebiscite under United Nations auspices. “If India has any respect for international law and moral courage, it will end its reign of terror, withdraw its troops and let the Kashmiris freely decide their future,” he said, noting the country’s “Islamophobia and bigotry against minorities”, particularly Muslims., The representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo recalled Rwanda’s occupation of his country, the atrocities it committed and its plundering of his country’s economy. The international community has emphasized the crisis in Europe while ignoring the crisis in Africa and placing restrictions on armament, he said. In urging an end to the double standard, he called on the international community to condemn and take action against any invasion or occupation of a country by another., The representative of Rwanda, taking the floor again, said that the Democratic Republic of the Congo needs to move beyond blaming his country for its problems and look for homegrown solutions. Whenever there are elections in that country, Rwanda is brought up, he said, adding that both countries as neighbours need to address the real problems., UKRAINE",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/143-votes-favour-5-against-general-assembly-adopts-resolution-condemning-russian-federations-annexation-four-eastern-ukraine-regions

IMF Executive Board Approves US$ 1.3 Billion in Emergency Financing Support to Ukraine,News and Press Release,IMF,Recovery and Reconstruction,7 Oct 2022,"Washington, DC: The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a disbursement of US$1.3 billion (SDR 1,005.9 million) under the food shock window of the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to help meet Ukraine’s urgent balance of payments needs., The scale and intensity of Russia’s war against Ukraine that started more than seven months ago have caused tremendous human suffering and economic pain. Amid massive population displacement and destruction of housing and key infrastructure, real GDP is projected to contract by 35 percent in 2022 relative to 2021 and financing needs remain very large. This disbursement under the RFI (equivalent to 50 percent of Ukraine’s quota in the IMF) will help meet urgent balance of payment needs, including due to a large cereal export shortfall, while playing a catalytic role for further financial support from Ukraine’s creditors and donors., The authorities deserve considerable credit for having maintained an important degree of macro-financial stability in these extremely challenging circumstances and have requested program monitoring with board involvement to strengthen their policy commitment and further catalyze donor support., The Executive Board reiterated its strong support for the Ukrainian people., Following the Executive Board discussion, Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director and Chair, made the following statement:, ""Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that started over seven months ago has caused large loss of life, massive population displacement, and significant destruction of infrastructure and housing. The impact on economic activity has been enormous: real GDP has severely contracted, inflation has risen sharply, trade has been significantly disrupted, and the fiscal deficit has increased to unprecedented levels., ""The Ukrainian authorities deserve considerable credit for having maintained an important degree of macro-financial stability in these extremely challenging circumstances. As the economy adapts to the now prolonged war, key macroeconomic policies have been geared toward safeguarding priority expenditures, easing pressure on the hryvnia and international reserves, and preserving financial stability., ""Against this backdrop, and in light of the persistent urgent balance of payments needs, including due to a large shortfall in cereal exports, the IMF has approved new emergency financing for Ukraine totaling SDR 1,005.9 billion (about US$1.3 billion) under the new Food Shock Window., ""Ukraine faces risks and uncertainties related to the hazardous security situation, policy implementation capacity, and external developments. Unique to the extreme circumstances now prevailing in Ukraine, very high uncertainty makes it difficult, at present, to assess with sufficient precision what would be required to ensure sustainability of Ukraine’s debt, but the balance of probabilities suggests that there are higher risks of debt being unsustainable., ""In conjunction with Ukraine’s continued commitment to economic, fiscal and governance reforms as well as strong engagement of all other stakeholders, including International Financial Institutions and the private sector, the bulk of Ukraine's official bilateral creditors and donors— through the relevant Executive Directors at the Fund—have signaled that they intend to continue financially supporting Ukraine to help achieve a balanced growth path and medium-term external viability., ""In order to allay the risks to the Fund from lending to Ukraine under these circumstances, these bilateral creditors and donors have reaffirmed their recognition of the Fund's preferred creditor status in respect of the amounts outstanding to Ukraine, including the requested drawing by Ukraine under the new RFI Food Shock Window. They undertake—given Ukraine's continuing cooperation with the Fund—to provide financial support on appropriate terms to secure Ukraine’s ability to service to the Fund its existing obligations that have already been approved by the Executive Board and the amounts provided under the new Food Shock Window, in accordance with the Fund's preferred creditor status. They have also confirmed that during this initial period of support by the Fund a deferral by the Group of Creditors of Ukraine will be in place as announced on July 20, 2022, with respect to those obligations of Ukraine that are falling due to them., The Fund will remain closely engaged with the Ukrainian authorities, with whom staff discussions will start soon on Program Monitoring with Board involvement (PMB). The PMB will aim to provide a strong anchor for macroeconomic policies, further catalyze donor support, and help to pave the way towards the upper credit tranche arrangement."", IMF Communications Department

Update 117 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (12 Oct 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,12 Oct 2022,"External power has been restored to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), a few hours after its connection to the grid was cut for a second time in less than a week, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today., The IAEA team of experts present at the ZNPP said the plant's connection to its last remaining operating 750 kilovolt (kV) power line was re-established around 1:40pm local time, enabling the plant to switch off the diesel generators that had been providing the reactors with electricity after the off-site power was lost in the morning., Director General Grossi welcomed the restoration of external power but stressed that the power situation at the ZNPP, Europe's largest nuclear power plant, remained very fragile., Ukraine's national nuclear operator Energoatom earlier said shelling had caused the off-site power loss by damaging a sub-station -- part of the grid's electrical transmission and distribution system -- located far from the plant itself. Last Saturday, the ZNPP's external power connection was cut due to renewed shelling near the plant. It was repaired the following day. The plant's diesel generators have fuel for about 10 days., The plant's six reactors are in cold shutdown but still require power for cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions., A secure off-site power supply from the grid is essential for ensuring nuclear safety. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-117-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-12-oct-2022
Update 116 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (12 Oct 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,12 Oct 2022,"Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) lost all external power for a second time in less than a week today, further underlining the precarious nuclear safety and security situation at the facility and the need for urgent action to protect it during the current military conflict, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said., The IAEA team of experts present at the ZNPP reported that the connection to its last remaining operating 750 kilovolt (kV) power line was cut around 9am local time. The plant’s emergency diesel generators automatically started operating to provide the six reactors with the electricity they need for cooling and other essential safety functions., Ukraine also confirmed the power loss. Its national nuclear operator Energoatom said shelling had caused it by damaging a sub-station – part of the grid’s electrical transmission and distribution system – located far from the plant itself. Last Saturday, the ZNPP’s external power connection was cut due to renewed shelling near the plant. It was repaired the following day but is now down again. The plant’s diesel generators have fuel for about 10 days., “The repeated loss of off-site power at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant is deeply worrying. The fact that the plant’s external power was lost because of an incident far away shows how vulnerable it is with only one power line connecting it to the grid,” Director General Grossi said. “The situation at the plant is clearly untenable and immediate action is required to strengthen nuclear safety and security and prevent a nuclear accident from happening.”, Director General Grossi has proposed the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP, engaging in high-level talks with Ukraine and the Russian Federation aimed at agreeing and implementing such a zone as soon as possible., Last week, he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv and they will meet again there tomorrow, following the Director General’s discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg yesterday., A secure off-site power supply from the grid is essential for ensuring nuclear safety. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-116-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-12-oct-2022
Overcoming the trauma of war,News and Press Release,SOS,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",12 Oct 2022,"What SOS Children’s Villages in Ukraine and Poland do to protect the mental health of children affected by war, “Mental health support is an absolute necessity”, Nearly half of Ukraine’s population is in urgent need of humanitarian assistance as a result of the full-scale invasion that started on 24 February 2022. Since then, 7 million people have been internally displaced and another 7 million, including 2,5 million children, have left the country., “Mental health support is an absolute necessity,” says Yevgeniya Rzayeva, SOS Children’s Villages’ emergency response manager who moved from Kyiv to Warsaw following the invasion. “Ukrainian people are still shocked and under tremendous stress. They do not know what to do or how to move forward with their lives. Many are traumatized by the war itself and by the losses they have suffered when their relatives or friends were injured or killed and their homes destroyed.”, Experiences of war during childhood and adolescence can have long-term psychological and social consequences. There are clear disparities between the mental health of war-affected people and the general population. Children in war conditions experience, witness or are threatened with staggering violence and abuse. They often lose loved ones, are forced to flee their homes and separate from their families. Lack of access to basic services and education threatens their development., Every child has the rights to live, have a family and a safe home, as stated in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. War violates these rights on multiple levels with serious consequences for children’s mental health. Post-traumatic stress disorder and depression are the mental disorders most common among children exposed to conflict. Other reported conditions include acute stress reactions, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, panic, anxiety and sleep disorders., MHPSS in Ukraine, Mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) has been a high priority in the emergency response of SOS Children’s Villages in Ukraine. For the past months, mobile teams of psychologists have reached more than 2,000 people in different parts of the country. Specialists have worked with children to teach them techniques that reduce stress, fear and anxiety. This summer, almost 2,000 children took part in therapeutic camps. Yevgeniya Rzayeva says: “The camps gave children an opportunity to enjoy nature, swim and play together. In this friendly environment, psychologists organized group activities focused on overcoming the trauma of war.”, In social services centers across western and central Ukraine, over 7,000 internally displaced children and families have received daily care, counseling and other forms of individual support. For the past six months, SOS Children’s Villages Ukraine have kept scaling up their emergency response. All the family strengthening activities and support for internally displaced people contributed to protecting the mental health of children. The total number of people supported crossed 82,000 in August 2022., For children in parts of Ukraine, war has been the everyday reality since 2014. UNICEF estimated that nearly half a million children caught up in the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine were facing grave risks to their physical and mental health and needed psychosocial support. Acute stress, nightmares, social isolation and panic attacks were among the reported symptoms., SOS Children’s Villages Ukraine began supporting foster families in the Luhansk region in 2012, and kept providing them support throughout the Donbas War. In mid-February 2022, some of the children and their foster parents moved to western Ukraine. Once the full-scale invasion started, foster families were evacuated abroad., “Living in eastern Ukraine was terrifying already since 2014, but what we have been going through for the past six months is very different,” says Nataliia Herasymenko, acting head of the unit for foster family care from SOS Children’s Villages in Ukraine. “This time, children had to leave everything behind and move to a different country. They kept asking why. They could not understand why they cannot go back home.”, Arriving in Poland, Nataliia Herasymenko and her child were among the foster families from Luhansk who moved to western Ukraine in mid-February 2022 because of the tension building up in the region. “Once we arrived to Truskavets, we all felt relieved. We could rest and enjoy our time in the Lviv region. Everything was going well until 24 February. When we heard the sirens that Thursday, we understood the invasion had started. Everyone was simply terrified.”, Nataliia and the other families were evacuated to the SOS Children’s Village in Krasnik, Poland. “We arrived very early in the morning, but everything was already prepared: our bedrooms, food and clothes. All the staff members were there waiting to welcome us.”, Since the beginning of the invasion, SOS Children’s Villages in Ukraine and Poland have been working together in their emergency response. At first, the focus was on relocation assistance: providing transport, accommodation and basic necessities. The foster families have been welcomed in four SOS Children’s Villages. SOS Children’s Village Poland also welcomed evacuated children from residential institutions., “We tried to care for them in the same way we would like to be cared for: to make them feel secure in all possible ways,” says Barbara Michota, deputy director of the SOS Children’s Village in Krasnik. “From day one, we were working around the clock to organize the reception. We wanted to make sure the Ukrainian families had someone they could come to day and night. And we listened to stories: someone’s husband was still in Ukraine, someone left a dog behind, someone else cried every time they saw a cat because their own cat died under the rubble. The relationships that started with these emotional conversations will last a lifetime.”, Healing through movement, Once the basic needs of the arriving families were met, the planning of regular MHPSS activities started. For years following the outbreak of the Dobnas war, SOS Children’s Villages in eastern Ukraine offered mental health and psychosocial support to families and children traumatized by conflict, family separation and neglect. Psychological care and speech therapy were provided to children who developed speech disorders, had problems socializing and self-expressing and suffered other consequences of the trauma of war. In social centers in Luhansk, where the families living now in Krasnik come from, mental health-related services were a vital part of the holistic support for families., In Poland, Nataliia Herasymenko started with movement-based group activities for children and young people so they could get to know one another and take their minds off the situation in Ukraine, even for a moment. Physical activity plays a big role in protecting the mental well-being of children and caregivers. In Krasnik, Barbara Michota leads fitness classes for foster mothers so they can bond and reduce stress. Children train in jiu-jitsu and play other sports that help them integrate and stabilize their emotions., Aleksandra Sikorska, SOS Children’s Villages’ psychologist, is currently adding TeamUp to the range of MHPSS activities in Poland. This method of working with refugee children, developed by War Child Holland, has already been used by SOS Children’s Villages in Greece, Italy and Sweden. During their summer camp stay in Caldonazzo, Italy, Polish and Ukrainian children took part in TeamUp sessions., “Through movement activities, non-competitive sports and play, children practice their psychosocial skills. The use of language is minimal, so everyone can join in. TeamUp boosts integration in international groups: children who at first approach one another hesitantly get encouraged to socialize when they see they can have fun together,” says Aleksandra, the psychologist. “The power of TeamUp lies in humor, genuine laughter and positive emotions that activate other parts of the brain than those responsible for fear, stress and sense of danger. On top of that, by observing children during the sessions, we are able to identify those that need more specialist care.”, Targeted mental health support, In all the Polish programmes, children, foster parents and other caregivers have access to psychological care. Some of them still meet online with the specialists they worked with in Ukraine, some attend in-person meetings. Psychiatric care is organized as needed for children who suffer from more severe mental disorders., Psychologist Aleksandra Sikorska says: “Therapy and medical interventions are one part of MHPSS services we provide - not all Ukrainian children and families need it. What everyone needs is a secure environment and day to day support. We must make sure the refugees have the feeling of agency, are listened to and well-informed. What also helps is the sense of community between the families that share similar experiences. Finally, there is the importance of mental health support for foster parents. When caregivers are scared or worried, children are scared and worried even more”., Children in alternative care are among the most vulnerable groups in armed conflicts – their situation and threats to their mental health are different than for children who grow up with the support of a family. Mental health services must address these complex, specific needs. Beata Kulig, SOS Children’s Villages’ advocacy advisor, says: “Ukrainian children in SOS Children’s Villages have lived through what Polish children in alternative care have experienced as well: complex developmental trauma. On top of that, some of them cope with war trauma. Those who were evacuated before the war, were suddenly ripped from their worlds and had to leave everything behind. They know that their homes, the places where they left people they care for, may no longer exist. We must assess every child’s individual mental health needs, looking not only at the war trauma but at what has traumatized them in their childhoods and their relationships with other people”., Learning to live in a new country, with a different language and culture is challenging both for children and their caregivers. The receiving community also needs to learn to help in the right way. Beata Kulig says: “It took us some time to understand the Ukrainian alternative care system and work through our differences. Classes with intercultural trainers would be an important part of the mental health support. They would address the most basic need of Ukrainian refugees: feeling that they arrive in a place where someone understands them.”, Looking toward the future, SOS Children’s Villages in Poland is working to create a network of mental health centers for Ukrainian refugees, in which they will have access to psychological and psychiatrist care, rehabilitation and therapy in their language. The first center near Warsaw will launch by the end of 2022. Tomasz Wodzynski from the emergency response team of SOS Children’s Villages Poland says: “We asked ourselves: what is our core competency? Giving children long-term support and the best possible environment to grow up in. Children arriving from the war-torn Ukraine might have seen things no child should ever witness. To move forward with their lives, they need psychological care, a specialist they can talk to about their traumas. This is what the mental health support centers will provide for everyone, not only for the refugees in our direct care.”, During his visit in Poland, Dereje Wordofa, President of SOS Children’s Villages International, had the opportunity to talk to Ukrainian families and discuss the next steps of the emergency response with both national teams., “What the people of Ukraine need is peace. They want to go back to their lives. They want to care for their children back in their home country and send them to Ukrainian schools. They want to meet again with their friends and families. I know they will continue with the same resilience and ambition to rebuild their country and we will be there to support them,” says Mr.Wordofa., Ukrainian refugees are waiting for the war to end, so they can reclaim their lives and continue overcoming the traumas of war back home. Nataliia Herasymenko says: “Everything in Krasnik is beautiful and well-organized. We are living through ups and downs supported by people we already feel very close to. Still, every time I go back to the moment I left Ukraine, I realize how much I miss my country. We are all waiting for the moment when it will be safe to go back. We all want to be at home, living our lives to the fullest surrounded by people we love.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/overcoming-trauma-war

Shelter and Non-Food Items",12 Oct 2022,"Following the massive missile strikes by Russia in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and in the cities of Lviv, Kharkiv, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia earlier this week, Caritas Ukraine and Caritas Spes-Ukraine have issued a joint statement reiterating their strong call for “an end to the violence”., Tetiana Stawnychy, President of Caritas Ukraine and Father Vyacheslav Grynevych, CEO of Caritas Spes-Ukraine, say the latest deadly strike has “made an already difficult humanitarian situation, more acute, as the country prepares for what promise to be difficult winter months ahead”., At least 14 people were killed and around 100 people were injured as a result of the blasts across the European nation. The population is gripped with fear and there is tremendous psychological stress on the people. To date, Caritas reports no staff members were harmed during this latest act of violence., “Those affected by these strikes were ordinary people trying to go about their everyday lives; parents taking children to school; people on their way to work. People across the country, including Caritas staff, have reached out to each other, to their friends and loved ones today, to ask ‘are you in safety?’ praying for an answer,” reads the statement., In many areas, internet or mobile connection, water and electricity have been cut. In addition, civilian infrastructure has been destroyed including homes, schools and medical facilities., “As a Caritas network we stand in prayer with those who were affected today and remain dedicated to continuing our response to the needs on the ground as we are able.”, In solidarity with Caritas Ukraine and Caritas Spes-Ukraine, Caritas Internationalis is calling on the confederation and the international community to not forget those most in need in Ukraine, particularly with the approach of winter, and to support Caritas life-saving work in the country., Caritas Internationalis Secretary General. Aloysius John says, “The war continues, the sufferings are tremendous, innocent lives are sacrificed.

In turn, kitchen support (38%) and food products (30%) top the list of the most urgent reported needs, closely followed by sleeping items (29%) and washing/drying machines (29%). There is a persisting gap between the collective sites’ needs and humanitarian support supplied, which needs particular attention from humanitarian actors. Fifty-four percent of the CSs reported that no IDPs were planning to leave the site in the nearest time following data collection date.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-collective-site-monitoring-csm-round-3-august-september-2022

In a statement, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was “deeply shocked by today's large-scale missile attacks by the armed forces of the Russian Federation on cities across Ukraine that reportedly resulted in widespread damage to civilian areas and led to dozens of people being killed and injured,” and adding that, “this constitutes another unacceptable escalation of the war and, as always, civilians are paying the highest price.” Humanitarian Coordinator for Ukraine Denise Brown, in her statement, also condemned yesterday’s attacks and their devastating impact on civilians – while stressing that humanitarian assistance continued to be delivered to people in desperate need of support. “Humanitarian aid will not stop,” the Humanitarian Coordinator said. “The United Nations and the entire humanitarian community are committed to staying and continuing our work to save lives and support people whose lives have been devastated by this war.”, At the same time, widespread attacks impacting infrastructure continued to be reported across the country on 11 October by the authorities and humanitarian partners. Explosions were reportedly heard and missiles and drones were reportedly intercepted in the western Khmelnytska, Lvivska and Rivnenska oblasts, in the northern Kyivska oblast, and in the southern Mykolaivska and Odeska oblasts, as well as in the central Dnipropetrovska oblast. In central Vinnytska oblast, a thermal power plant was reportedly hit., Among the impacts of yesterday’s attacks, the Ministry of Interior Affairs was reported to have announced more than 110 civilian casualties across Ukraine – with at least 14 people killed and 97 others injured. The State Emergency Service of Ukraine (SESU) reported 11 October that critical, civilian infrastructure had been impacted in 12 of the country’s 24 oblasts – with electricity and water supply-systems as well as telecommunications affected. SESU said that some 300 settlements remained without power, including in Khmelnytska, Kyivska, Sumska, and Ternopilska oblasts. Meanwhile, Ukrainian electricity-grid operator Ukrenergo announced measures including calling on Ukrainians to reduce their power consumption during peak-usage hours in the evenings.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-escalation-attacks-across-country-flash-update-no2-enuk
USAID and Bayer partner to support Ukrainian farmers and address the global food security crisis,News and Press Release,USAID,"Agriculture
Contributions
Food and Nutrition",10 Oct 2022,"Today, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), through the Agriculture Resilience Initiative - Ukraine (AGRI-Ukraine), announced a new partnership with Bayer to address the immediate and longer-term demand for corn seed among Ukrainian farmers and other countries that depend on seed from Ukraine., AGRI-Ukraine is a USAID-led initiative to bolster Ukrainian agricultural production and exports, support Ukraine's embattled economy, and help to alleviate the global food security crisis exacerbated by Putin's brutal war on Ukraine. It focuses on providing critical agricultural supplies, improving export rail logistics and efficiency, increasing farmers' access to finance, and supporting storage, drying, and processing needs. AGRI-Ukraine is critical for strengthening Ukraine's export and agricultural sector, which will remain vulnerable to and affected by the Russian Federation's aggression in the months and years to come., Bayer plans to invest approximately $34.9 million (35 million euros) to boost the capacity of the company's seed processing facility in Pochuiky in Ukraine's Zhytomyr region. Opened by Bayer in 2018, the facility is the largest of its kind in Ukraine, and one of the largest in Europe. It processes high quality corn seed for farmers across Ukraine and beyond and employs over 100 permanent and 250 seasonal employees., Bayer's investment includes boosting the capacity of their seed dryer, providing additional field equipment, and adding supplemental storage facilities. By increasing the plant's capacity, Bayer will also create new employment opportunities in the region, in addition to covering the corn seed demand in Ukraine and beyond., Bayer's investment builds on the company's more than 25 years of support to Ukraine's agriculture sector. Agriculture is the bedrock of the Ukrainian economy, accounting for nearly 20 percent of Ukraine's GDP, 20 percent of the workforce, and more than 40 percent of total export revenues. In the wake of the Russian Federation's brutal invasion, Bayer has donated more than 40,000 bags of corn seed that will enable more than 1,250 smaller farmers to grow food. It also has donated funds for a mechanical mine clearing machine to help farmers grow food safely in coordination with the U.S. Department of State-funded demining operations., Ukraine's agriculture sector has immense needs. Putin's unjustified invasion of Ukraine has reduced production of barley, corn, rapeseed, sunflower seed, and wheat by 30 to 40 percent, drastically diminished Ukraine's export capacity through the Russian Federation's months-long blockade of Black Sea ports from late February to August, and left exports dependent on severely constrained rail capacity. In the long term, rail export routes must be improved and expanded to avoid dependence on Black Sea ports, and allow Ukraine to efficiently access regional markets. Ukraine requires substantial supplemental storage due to these export constraints, and it continues to face a limited supply of critical supplies like seed, fertilizer, and fuel. The costs of planting, irrigating, fertilizing, harvesting, and transporting crops have all risen substantially, draining away farmers' primary source of income and jeopardizing their ability and willingness to plant for future seasons., USAID, through AGRI-Ukraine, contributed $100 million and seeks to leverage an additional $150 million, including from fellow donors, the private sector and foundations, with an overall investment target of $250 million.

Ukraine: Attack on civilians and infrastructure [EN/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,11 Oct 2022,"DELIVERED BY Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ravina Shamdasani
LOCATION Geneva, The missile attacks by Russian armed forces yesterday which struck cities across Ukraine left at least 12 civilians dead and more than 100 injured in Kyiv, Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia, and in Kyiv and Sumy regions. The location and timing of the strikes – when people were commuting to work and taking children to school – is particularly shocking., We are gravely concerned that some of the attacks appear to have targeted critical civilian infrastructure. Many civilian objects, including dozens of residential buildings and vital civilian infrastructure – including at least 12 energy facilities – were damaged or destroyed in eight regions, indicating that these strikes may have violated the principles on the conduct of hostilities under international humanitarian law. Damage to key power stations and lines ahead of the upcoming winter raises further concerns for the protection of civilians and in particular the impact on vulnerable populations., Attacks targeting civilians and objects indispensable to the survival of civilians are prohibited under international humanitarian law., We urge the Russian Federation to refrain from further escalation, and to take all feasible measures to prevent civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure., Our Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine will continue corroborating information on civilian casualties resulting from these attacks, as well as documenting violations of human rights and international humanitarian law throughout the country., ENDS, For more information and media requests, please contact:

"Stigma, trauma and song: The toll of war in Ukraine",News and Press Release,HelpAge,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",10 Oct 2022,"On this year’s World Mental Health Day, HelpAge International’s regional mental health and psychosocial support and protection adviser Lindsay Bingaman reflects on the challenges older people face after months of war., When I first heard a particular traditional Ukrainian song, I remember the feeling of reassurance and togetherness it created -- and the tears that rolled down all our faces., The two girls standing in front of us sang it beautifully. Their grandmother watched proudly: a woman who had fled with them and her daughter, leaving behind everything she knew, desperately worrying for her son on the frontline., It was mid-summer and I had only been in Ukraine for a few days. The song deeply moved me as I sat with internally displaced people in a collective centre HelpAge International is supporting in Chernivtsi, western Ukraine., I later noticed the same song Oy u luzi chervona kalyna (In the Meadow, a Red Kalyna), had become a sort of 'war-time anthem', being played on radios everywhere and sung by performers on the streets of Lviv. I realised too how singing and dancing is a way people are coping with the mental strains of war., As with most of the world, the stigma around mental health remains in Ukraine. The girls' grandmother was in her 60s, insisting she was not as vulnerable as others, humble about all she was doing to help with the children, cooking for everyone., I have spoken to many older people like her in Ukraine who won't talk about their needs. They say, 'I'm fine', deflect, and point to others who they say need support more. They focus on what they are grateful for - another coping mechanism., Suspicion is also an issue. In Lviv, I met an 83-year-old woman living with her daughter and son -- both in their sixties -- in an adapted students' dormitory with other displaced people. The son had a disability, so his sister cared for them both. In a building of stairs and steps, they lived in one room, their mother only showering every four days because access was so difficult and needing her daughter's help to reach the toilet. They admitted they were 'too depressed' to go outside but that they 'didn't trust psychologists' or want 'mental health' support., Mental health covers a wide range of conditions from anxiety to dementia. Globally, almost a billion people have a mental health disorder, and it is estimated that 5 percent of adults suffer from depression. Covid-19, according to the World Health Organisation, has also'created a global crisis for mental health'., A HelpAge survey revealed 96 percent of older eastern Ukrainians experienced conflict-related mental health issues, even a couple of years ago as a result of the ongoing hostilities with Russia. Add Covid-19 to that and almost eight months of full-scale war, and the situation has only worsened across the country. Even in the first few months, there was a warning of stretched mental health services in the face of growing demand., Many people I've met in Chernivtsi, Lviv and Dnipro have been struggling from the distress and trauma caused by the war, as well as grief, loneliness and lack of sleep., For some older people, the war has been a trigger, bringing back memories of World War II or the Soviet era. These stress responses can contribute to decisions to remain at home, despite the dangers. A likely lack of mobility to reach shelter during air raids heightens the fear and distress., While younger people are becoming more open about their mental health, older people remain tangled in the shame and stigma of it. That is why First Lady Olena Zelenska's work to tackle the nation's mental health is so important at the national and global level., It is also why it is important to look for somatic indications that might suggest a mental health issue, such as headaches, stomach aches, difficulty focusing, and a lack of sleep., Physical and mental health among older people, The link between physical and mental health is particularly important for older people. Stress releases cortisol, for example, which can increase blood sugar, blood pressure and heart rate while reducing immunity. This is critical for an older population already experiencing an increase in non-communicable diseases., Talking can often be enough, but many aren't ready to share their current traumatic experiences. They first need to feel safe, have their basic needs met, and be around people they know or who care about them -- an approach that has shaped our response., World Mental Health Day is a reminder of how the humanitarian community should focus on reducing the stigma around mental health and increasing psychoeducation around the importance of mental health. Mental health and psychosocial support to Ukrainians should continue, especially for older people who are likely to have experienced war and displacement before. This can sometimes be as simple as singing a song together or providing a listening ear -- but can make all the difference.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/stigma-trauma-and-song-toll-war-ukraine
"General Assembly Takes Up Draft Resolution Condemning Russian Federation’s Annexation of Several Territories in Eastern Ukraine, Resuming Emergency Special Session",News and Press Release,UN GA,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,10 Oct 2022,"GENERAL ASSEMBLY PLENARY, ELEVENTH EMERGENCY SPECIAL SESSION, 12TH MEETING (PM), GA/12456, As part of its ongoing emergency special session on Ukraine, the General Assembly met today to consider a draft resolution introduced by Ukraine that, if approved, would condemn the Russian Federation’s annexation of several territories in eastern Ukraine in late September. Many delegates today deplored the annexation as a violation of international law while criticizing the Security Council’s inability to uphold global peace and security., [Today’s special session was mandated after the Council on 30 September failed to adopt a resolution intended to condemn the Russian Federation referenda that preceded Moscow’s proclamation of its annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. (See Press Release SC/15046 for details.) The draft Council resolution also would have declared that the referenda taken on 23 to 27 September in parts of those regions are neither valid nor form the basis for any alternation of the status of these regions of Ukraine, including any purported annexation by the Russian Federation.], Introducing the text titled “Territorial integrity of Ukraine: defending the principles of the Charter of the United Nations”, that country’s representative said that, since 23 September, the Russian Federation has again violated international law and the sham referenda in four Ukrainian areas pose an existential threat to the United Nations and its Charter. He urged the Assembly to defend the Charter principles and reconfirm they remain a strong shield to protect all nations. “We are now at a tipping point where the UN will either restore its credibility or ultimately fall in failure,” he said., The Russian Federation’s representative, however, said Ukraine and the West are pretending that history only began in February. Those who follow discussions in the Security Council know that his delegation had been ready to consider a balanced and fair text in that forum. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) only wants to escalate the conflict as part of its plan to undermine the Russian Federation, he said, stressing that Western Powers continue to supply the regime in Kyiv with deadly weapons, and Ukraine is now a platform to test them. Kyiv and its Western backers have covered up many crimes and those who scream about the Charter being violated did not remember that document when it came to the people of Kosovo and Iraq, he emphasized. He demanded that the Assembly suspend Rule 87 of its Rules of Procedure in order to take a decision on the draft resolution introduced by secret ballot — a motion that was rejected., Before the Russian Federation delegate took the floor, the Assembly approved a motion put forth by Albania’s delegate for the Assembly’s decision to be taken by a recorded vote. She said the Russian Federation’s efforts to hold a secret ballot is a threat to transparency, pointing out that there is no Assembly precedent to hold a secret ballot on a non-venue issue., Speaking on behalf of the Nordic and Baltic countries, the representative of Latvia said there is no such thing as a legitimate referendum amid human rights abuses and systematic violations of international humanitarian law, nor is there any such thing as a legal annexation of a State’s territory by another State after threats or direct use of force. The Russian Federation’s sham referenda and illegal attempt to annex any part of Ukrainian territory must be firmly and collectively rejected, he said, calling on the Russian Federation to completely and unilaterally withdraw its troops, comply with the 16 March order by the International Criminal Court and end its aggression against Ukraine., The representative of Fiji, speaking on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum, said: “The Charter cannot simply be worn like a prestigious cloak only to be discarded when perceived geopolitical interests are at stake.” He strongly condemned the Russian Federation’s latest threats to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine “and possibly others”. As a permanent member of the Council, the Russian Federation has an even greater responsibility to uphold the United Nations Charter, he said calling for that country to cease its attempted illegal annexations of Ukrainian territory, de-escalate the current situation and withdraw to its internationally recognized borders., Likewise, the speaker for Poland said the Charter desperately needs the international community’s defence and condemned sham referenda which cannot lead to any binding action. He urged Member States to reject the Russian Federation’s illegal annexation attempt and vote to uphold the international legal order., Several delegates condemned the Russian Federation’s latest attacks on Kyiv and other cities. The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, said the indiscriminate attacks on civilians are war crimes and perpetrators will be held accountable. In the past week, the bloc facilitated a resolution condemning the Russian Federation’s organization of illegal referenda and its subsequent attempt to illegally annex Ukraine’s territory. He urged all Member States to co-sponsor and vote in favour of the text. “If we do not condemn the actions of the Russian Federation in Ukraine today, then we condone similar blatant attacks on any and all of our countries tomorrow,” he warned., Noting that he woke up this morning to the shocking news of the Russian Federation’s attacks, the representative of Türkiye said the war must cease. This Assembly session is being held because the Council failed its primary responsibility. The Russian Federation’s attempts to annex Ukrainian territory are illegal and only serve to jeopardize prospect for peace. Türkiye has sponsored a draft resolution that will be put forward this week, he said, calling for negotiations to end the hostilities., The speaker for Costa Rica condemned the shelling that ravaged Ukrainian communities over the weekend and said the international community must fear power with impunity and vanquish it with bravery. Noting that today’s meeting is taking place in the Assembly Hall and not the Trusteeship Council, she reminded delegates that States can no longer take the territory of others and expressed solidarity with the people from Ukraine and the Russian Federation who do not benefit from this neo-imperial transgression. States should not recognize annexations and must demand their end, she said, supporting law over force and a peaceful, negotiated solution., Also speaking today were representatives of Singapore, Indonesia, Malta, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Dominican Republic, Albania, Austria, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, United Kingdom and Mexico., At the beginning of the meeting, the Assembly decided by consensus that the Credentials Committee of the seventy-seventh session should serve for the resumed eleventh emergency special session. It also decided to follow the provisions of resolution 77/2 of 7 October, by which the Comoros, Sao Tome and Principe and Somalia are permitted to vote in the Assembly until the end of its seventy-seventh session, and vote at the eleventh emergency special session., The Assembly will meet again at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, 11 October, to consider the election of Human Rights Council members., Rules of Procedure, The representative of Albania proposed that the Assembly follow Rule 87 B of its Rules of Procedure and asked that a recorded vote be used when considering draft resolution “Territorial integrity of Ukraine: defending the principles of the Charter of the United Nations” (document A/ES-11/L.5). She said she proposed the motion because the Russian Federation has circulated a proposal that the action be taken through a secret ballot. The Assembly should clarify the issue to avoid confusion. She said the effort of the Russian Federation is a threat to transparency, pointing out that there is no Assembly precedent to hold a secret ballot on a non-venue issue., The Assembly then approved by a vote of 107 in favour, to 33 against, with 13 abstentions, the Albanian representative’s motion ‑ that the pending decision on Assembly resolution A/ES-11/L.5 be taken by a recorded vote., Statement by President of General Assembly, CSABA KŐRÖSI (Hungary), President of the General Assembly, said that even though the war in Ukraine should have never started, it will end one day. “Guns will be silent, but when? At what cost?” he asked. In spotlighting skyrocketing food prices and the threat of famine, he called for the Black Sea Grain Initiative’s renewal beyond November. Turning to the constant fear of nuclear disaster, he commended the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for ensuring the safety of nuclear plants in the warzone. Any threat of using nuclear weapons should be universally condemned, he said. The United Nations Charter, Assembly and Secretary‑General have all been clear: aggression is illegal. Annexing territories by force is also illegal, he added while echoing the Secretary‑General that the referenda in occupied regions cannot be a genuine expression of popular will. “When it [be]comes a daily routine to watch images of destroyed cities and scattered bodies, we lose our humanity,” he stressed. The fighting must stop; the Russian Federation must withdraw its troops from Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders in line with the Assembly’s resolution on 2 March 2022. The alternative is a world without shared rules, without peace, without a future, he warned., Introduction of Draft Resolution, SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine), introducing “L.5”, said his day began 14 hours ago when his country was under attack and his family was unable to go to a bomb shelter. The Russian Federation is trying to bring the world back to the 1930s, when Adolf Hitler destroyed sovereign nations by invasion, fake referenda and Anschluss, he added. “We are now at a tipping point where the UN will either restore its credibility or ultimately fall in failure,” he said, as it is the Assembly’s responsibility to defend the principles of the Charter. Since 23 September, the Russian Federation has carried out another crime against international law. The sham referenda in four Ukrainian regions, followed by unlawful decisions by the Russian President and Parliament, served this very purpose and pose an existential threat to the United Nations and its Charter, he said., Recalling the Organization’s first purpose enshrined in Article 1 of the Charter ‑ to maintain international peace and security and, to that end, to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace and for the suppression of acts of aggression, he said Paragraph 4 of Article 2 is the most important in the regard, particularly concerning the threat and use of force against the territorial integrity and political independence of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Violation of Paragraph 4 violates the cornerstone of peace in the Charter and basic rules of contemporary international law. “The only thing that Russia is afraid of is our strong unity of purpose in the UN Charter, in defence of the right of every country to benefit from respect for its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said, adding: “We have to save the United Nations. Not for the sake of this Hall, high-level weeks and other procedural and protocol issues that have been our routine since 1945. We need to do it for the sake of ourselves as most of us will find ourselves extremely vulnerable and unprotected if the Russian vision of the future prevails.” He urged the Assembly to reconfirm the Charter’s principles remain a strong shield to protect all nations. The spirit that guided the Assembly’s predecessors in San Francisco 77 years ago to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war should guide the Assembly now when it considers the draft resolution, he said., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) began his speech with procedural issues, telling the hall that they had just witnessed “an outrageous fraud” when the General Assembly President took part in depriving his delegation from taking the floor on a point of order. “This is an unprecedented manipulation,” he added. Ukraine and the West are pretending that history only began in February 2022. Those who follow discussions in the Security Council know that the Russian Federation stood ready for a balanced and fair text and one that pushes for diplomacy. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) only wants to escalate the conflict which has long been part of its plan to undermine the Russian Federation, he said. Ukraine was chosen by those countries for this very purpose and is today a platform to test weapons., The Russian Federation is trying to “protect our brothers and sisters in Eastern Ukraine”, he continued. Those are the same people that the Ukrainian Government calls “subhuman”. Kyiv and its Western backers have covered up many crimes. Those who scream about the United Nations Charter being violated did not remember that document when it came to the people of Kosovo and Iraq. The regime in Kyiv continues to be supplied deadly weapons by Western powers. These weapons target civilians, who are being “executed and thrown into pits”. In the east and the south of Ukraine, peaceful people are dying. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s appeal for a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the Russian Federation threatens global peace, he said, adding that the principle of territorial integrity applies to those that represent the entire people living under that Government. The Kyiv regime is devoid of this privilege because it impedes and violates the rights of the Russian-speaking people, but that is not in line with the unilateral speaking points of the West. He demanded that the Assembly suspend Rule 87 of its Rules of Procedure in order to take a decision on draft resolution A/ES-11/L.5 by secret ballot., Mr. KŐRÖSI said this would constitute a reconsideration of Assembly’s earlier decision to adopt the motion submitted by Albania and recalled Rule 81., The representatives of Albania and Ukraine took the floor to oppose the motion by the Russian Federation., The representative of the Russian Federation disagreed with the President’s ruling saying that Rule 81 does not apply as there are two different proposals. As the Russian Federation is proposing that Rule 87 B be suspended as a whole, Article 71 applies to his delegation’s proposal, he clarified., Mr. KŐRÖSI said Rule 81 is applicable as the Russian Federation has challenged the President’s ruling that the proposal is a reconsideration of the earlier decision. The Assembly rejected the appeal against the President’s ruling by a vote of 100 against to 14 in favour with 38 in abstention. The Assembly upheld the President’s ruling., The Assembly then rejected a reconsideration of its earlier decision by a vote of 104 against to 16 in favour, with 34 in abstention., The representative of the Russian Federation then took the floor on a point of order and called for a vote on the draft resolution., Mr. KŐRÖSI reiterated that he would conduct the meeting in accordance with the Assembly’s Rules of Procedure and past practices including of emergency special sessions. The Assembly therefore would proceed with the debate and then take action on the resolution., The representative of the Russian Federation, taking the floor on a point of order, asked for previous instances where the decisions on the Rules of Procedure, including voting, were taken at the beginning of the debate with voting then occurring at the end. Disagreeing with the “illogical and inconsistent” approach, he referenced the Assembly’s long wait before voting and expressed his regret over how the proceedings were conducted., ANDREJS PILDEGOVIČS (Latvia), speaking on behalf of the Nordic and Baltic Countries, said there is no such thing as a legitimate referendum amidst brutal warfare and widespread and systematic violations of international humanitarian law, human rights violations and abuses. There is no such thing as a valid annexation of a State’s territory by another State after threats or direct use of force. Under international law, all States are obliged to not recognize the attempted illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory by the Russian Federation. He said a world without respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and the rules-based international order cannot stand. Therefore, the sham referenda and illegal attempt to annex any part of Ukrainian territory by the Russian Federation must be firmly and collectively rejected, he said, adding that the Russian Federation must completely and unilaterally withdraw its troops from that territory within its internationally recognized borders. The Russian Federation must comply with the 16 March order of the International Criminal Court, which is binding on the parties, and stop its aggression against Ukraine. The Assembly must underline that the unacceptable threats of the Russian Federation on the use of nuclear weapons is in clear violation of the Charter, he stressed., SATYENDRA PRASAD (Fiji), speaking on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum, said: “The Charter cannot simply be worn like a prestigious cloak only to be discarded when perceived geopolitical interests are at stake.” He strongly condemned the latest threats of the Russian Federation to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine “and possibly others” and emphasized that as a permanent member of the Security Council, the Russian Federation has an even greater responsibility to uphold the Charter of the United Nations. The Pacific Islands Forum thus calls for that country to cease its attempted illegal annexations of Ukrainian territory, to de-escalate the current situation and to withdraw to its internationally recognized borders, he said., Speaking in his national capacity, he urged the Secretary‑General to use all available tools through his good offices to end the war. For its part, the Security Council must work to restore trust in the Charter and faith in the promise of the United Nations. Emphasizing the conflict’s impact on the entire world, especially in the Global South, at a time of manifold challenges, including climate change and a potential full-blown economic crisis, he said: “The war on Ukraine must end to give the world a fighting chance.”, SILVIO GONZATO, representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, condemned today’s attacks on Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine by the Russian Federation. Such indiscriminate attacks on civilians are war crimes and perpetrators will be held to account, he said. In the past week, the European Union facilitated a resolution condemning the Russian Federation’s organization of illegal referenda and its subsequent attempt to illegally annex Ukraine’s territory. He urged all Member States to co-sponsor and vote in favour of the text. “If we do not condemn the actions of the Russian Federation in Ukraine today, then we condone similar blatant attacks on any and all of our countries tomorrow,” he warned. He then rejected and condemned the illegal annexation of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions and called on all States and international organizations to do so as well., FERIDUN HADI SINIRLIOĞLU (Turkiye) said the war must cease. The Assembly session is being held because the Security Council failed its primary responsibility. He said he woke up to the shocking news this morning of the attacks by the Russian Federation. He supported Ukraine’s territorial integrity and rejected the alleged referenda, calling the attempts to annex Ukrainian territory illegal and a grave violation of international law. The annexation only serves to jeopardize the prospects for peace. The Russian Federation should reverse its decision and return to diplomacy, he stressed, adding that conflicts should be resolved through peaceful means. Turkiye has sponsored a draft resolution that will be put forward this week, he said. Stressing that Turkiye did not want war in the region, he called for negotiations to end the hostilities., BURHAN GAFOOR (Singapore) expressed disappointment and concern that the war in Ukraine has escalated with mounting casualties. The recent decision by the Russian Federation to organized referenda and annex four regions within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders is not only a further escalation but also a clear violation of international law and the Charter, he said. Sovereignty, political independence and territorial integrity must be respected. For small States, these are not matters of academic debate but rather of life and death, he emphasized while adding that a system based on the idea that might is right is unacceptable. As a co-sponsor of the draft resolution, he urged Member States to send a clear signal that international law must be upheld by voting in support., MARITZA CHAN VALVERDE (Costa Rica), in noting that the meeting is occurring in the Assembly Hall and not in the Trusteeship Council, reminded all that States can no longer take the territory of others. Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Crimea are all Ukraine, she stressed while condemning the shelling that ravaged Ukrainian communities over the weekend. The international community must fear power with impunity and vanquish it with bravery, she urged. Costa Rica stands in solidarity with the people from Ukraine and the Russian Federation who do not benefit from this neo-imperial transgression, she said. In spotlighting human rights violations, she called for all parties to comply with international law. The Russian Federation, she continued, must end its nuclear blackmail and abide by its obligations. States should not recognize annexations and must demand their end, the prevalence of law over force, the absence of impunity and a peaceful and negotiated solution, she emphasized., KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI (Poland) said the United Nations Charter desperately needs the international community’s defence and condemned sham referendums which cannot lead to any binding action. The upcoming vote on the draft resolution should be a strong and resounding yes. Not condemning the attempted annexation of Ukrainian territory undermines the international legal order, he said, and called on all Member States to speak out in defence of the territorial integrity of Ukraine and of its sovereign independence. He urged Member States to reject the Russian Federation’s illegal annexation attempt and vote yes for upholding the international legal order., ARRMANATHA CHRISTIAWAN NASIR (Indonesia) said it is “crystal clear” that the dispute between nations could only be solved through diplomacy. War only leads to death and destruction. The events of the last few hours and days underscore this. He reiterated his Government’s calls to end the war. The international community must work harder to ensure peace prevails, he said, stressing peace must be the ultimate priority. Innocent people caught in the crossfire are victims to war. But also, billions of people, particularly the world’s poor, have become unintended victims of this war, as the price of food and energy has skyrocketed in recent months. He urged the General Assembly to avoid a “take it or leave it” approach and expressed regret that calls for a peaceful resolution failed to be included in today’s draft resolution. Peaceful resolutions cannot be held back by divisions, he stressed., VANESSA FRAZIER (Malta), aligning herself with the European Union, fully supported the resumption of the Assembly’s emergency session and condemned the most recent attack against Kyiv and other cities. These are attacks against civilians and are war crimes, she said. As a member of the veto initiative, she firmly believed the Assembly has a duty to react to violations of international law. She condemned attempts by the Russian Federation to annex the areas through sham referenda, which are a blatant violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and show a complete disregard for international law. Stressing that the Security Council is responsible for international peace and security, she said the use of the veto in this situation is reprehensible and the rest of the United Nations membership must strongly reject this use., YOKA BRANDT (Netherlands), aligning herself with the European Union, said her country would never recognize the sham referenda and illegal attempts to annex Ukrainian territory. The Netherlands continues to stand firmly with Ukraine and will continue to provide support for as long as it takes, she added. Calling upon Member States to hold the Russian Federation to account and make clear that might is not right, she reminded all that the veto does not provide a blank check. “Our international rule book is no longer just in jeopardy. It has been trampled by a permanent member of the Security Council,” she emphasized. Those responsible for violating the Charter and committing atrocities must be held to account. As the Hague is the legal capital of the world, the Netherlands has a special responsibility and will not waver in its efforts to achieve justice for those who suffer from sexual violence, deportation, torture and random killing, she stressed. She condemned today’s attacks, renewed her country’s call on the Russian Federation to suspend its military operations and called on Member States to vote in favour., ANNE FRANÇOISE DOSTERT(Luxembourg), associating herself with the statement made by the European Union, condemned the aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine and its deadly missile attacks launched today against Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. Today’s meeting allows all Member States to speak on a subject of concern to everyone. Faced with Security Council’s paralysis, the General Assembly now has the responsibility to uphold the principles of the United Nations Charter. In these difficult times, Member States must particularly stress the principle that all countries should refrain from threatening the political independence and territorial sovereignty of any other state, she said. Any attempt at annexation of territory violates the Charter, has no legal value, and must be condemned. Today’s draft text is precise, she said, urging all Member States to vote for it. What is happening in Ukraine today, can happen to other nations tomorrow if the principles of the United Nations are not upheld, she warned., JOSÉ ALFONSO BLANCO CONDE (Dominican Republic) reaffirmed his delegation’s commitment to the international order. He said it is gravely concerning to see the principles of the Charter repeatedly violated. Recent events indicate that the conflict threatens to expand as the spaces for dialogue and a peaceful solution narrow. The move of the Russian Federation to decree the annexation of the Ukrainian territory is disturbing. The discussion of this issue is painful as it is a situation that violates the human rights of people in the area of conflict while placing the entire world on the brink of disaster, he said. It is difficult to endure these human rights violations and the fact that the Council cannot act, he said, pointing to the abuse of the veto in the Council. There is no other alternative but to appeal to the parties involved to exercise good sense, he concluded., ALBANA DAUTLLARI (Albania) said the referenda organized in a rush and at gunpoint demonstrated that there is no international law, United Nations Charter nor Constitution of Ukraine for the Russian Federation. Albania does not recognize the sham referenda and stands in full support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognizing borders. Describing the attempts of the Russian Federation to compare the independence of Kosovo with the illegal annexation of Ukraine as “wrong” and “cynical”, she said “no attempt to compare the incomparable nor shortcut out of any historical and political context will help Russia divert attention from its war of choice in Ukraine or hide its blatant breach of international law.” In recalling the veto of the Russian Federation of the Security Council text tabled by Albania and the United States, she noted that the Russian Federation cannot veto the Assembly. By voting in favour, Member States are voting for rules, order, justice, core principles, peace and security, she emphasized., JOCHEN HANS-JOACHIM ALMOSLECHNER (Austria), associating himself with the European Union, said that Member States have a duty to call for an end to the illegal acts of the Russian Federation in Ukraine. That is particularly important for neutral countries such as Austria which depend on respect for international law, treaties and customs for their security. The Security Council’s failure to act must be discussed and the Secretary‑General’s “New Agenda for Peace” is an opportunity to do so, he said. In the meantime, the Assembly must send a strong signal that the world does not accept this blatant breach of the Charter. He went on to say that “this senseless Russian aggression has plunged the whole world into peril” and that the threat of nuclear weapons is an unacceptable violation of Charter principles., CHRISTIAN WENAWESER (Liechtenstein) said the aggression of the Russian Federation goes hand in hand with its attempt to deface the fundamental concepts of international law. But the law is clear, and it is the international community’s collective duty to uphold it, he added. The attempt of the Russian Federation to forcibly annex Ukrainian territory is just its latest crime of aggression. Russian leadership must be held to account. The Russian Federation makes a mockery of the right to self-determination and its attempt to fabricate election results through blackmail and intimidation “evokes the worst memories of colonial oppression and imperialism”. These acts are not new but just the latest from a playbook that the Russian Federation has used in Syria and Chechnya as well, he added., PASCALE CHRISTINE BAERISWYL(Switzerland), emphasizing the importance of a rules-based international order, said: “We cannot tolerate that the power of the strongest prevails over the rights of the weakest.” The Russian Federation must de-escalate and withdraw its forces from Ukrainian territory, whose annexation violates Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, she added. She called on the Russian Federation to immediately stop indiscriminate attacks on residential areas in Ukraine, reiterated Switzerland’s call for strict respect of international humanitarian law and human rights and appealed for swift and unhindered humanitarian access throughout Ukraine and in areas occupied by the Russian Federation. In line with its humanitarian tradition, Switzerland reiterates its offer of good offices, she added., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said over seven months into the war, the whole world understands the terrible cost of the Russian Federation’s invasion. Even today, millions across Ukraine awoke to the sound of air raid sirens as the Russian Federation carried out one of the largest bombardments of civilian areas and infrastructure of the war, she said. As a result of the invasion, everyone’s lives around the world have been made more difficult and insecure. At Headquarters in New York, the cost is seen in terms of damage to the United Nations Charter. To the principle that no threat or use of force shall be made against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. If any rouge Head of State can, by force or fiat, change the borders of another Member State, then there can be no way to resolve disputes or to achieve the fundamental goals of the United Nations. She reiterated the United Kingdom’s call for the Russian Federation to end the war and to honour the Charter, and urged delegations to vote in favour of the draft resolution., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said his delegation will vote in favour of today’s draft text, a position grounded in support for stringent compliance with United Nations principles. Mexico has been a victim of invasions and cannot allow other countries to fall victim to such acts of aggression. There is no place for false dichotomies, he said, adding that one principle cannot be upheld while another violated. For example, the right to self-determination cannot violate the principle of sovereignty and territorial integrity. The so-called referenda held by the Russian Federation lack all legal standing. Given that a referendum was held during an armed conflict, any expression of popular will is null and void. It is not possible through a veto to eliminate or discredit international norms and legal institutions, he added, encouraging Member States to consider suspending the use of the veto in incidents of mass atrocities., For information media.

Russian attacks on Kyiv and cities across Ukraine are an escalation of aggression and apparent violations of laws of war,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,10 Oct 2022,"Reacting to reported Russian mass strikes on Kyiv and several other Ukrainian cities, Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, said:, “This is yet another day of petrifying news from Ukraine, with Russia launching multiple strikes that hit residential areas, city centres and civilian infrastructure. The crater left by a Russian missile in the middle of children’s playground in central Kyiv is a stark symbol of the complete disregard for human life that has characterized Russia’s invasion.”, “The ultimate goal of today’s attacks is to spread terror among the entire civilian population., “Russia must immediately stop its war of aggression. All those responsible for the aggression and war crimes, including commanders and civilian leaders, such as ministers, and heads of state should be held criminally responsible for their actions.”, Background, In the early hours and morning of 10 October, Russian forces carried out massive missile strikes on Kyiv and several other Ukrainian cities, including Dnipro, Zaporizhzhya, and Zhytomyr, among others. According to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, around 40 rockets fired by Russian forces hit targets in Ukraine., Critical infrastructure facilities like power plants and power substations in eight regions of Ukraine and in Kyiv seem to be the main targets of the attacks, which led to mass power shortages across the country and many train delays. According to Ukraine’s national police, out of 117 buildings damaged throughout the country 29 were critical infrastructure facilities, four were multi-storey buildings and 35 private residential houses., While Kyiv was one of the first targets at the start of the of the full-scale invasion by Russia, this is the first time its historic centre has been hit. Four Kyiv city districts came under attacks that damaged, among others, one of the buildings of the Kyiv National Shevchenko University, a pedestrian bridge and a playground in Shevchenko Park., According to the State Service of Emergency Situations, today’s attacks killed 11 people (five in Kyiv) and injured 89 across the country., Russia’s President Vladimir Putin welcomed the attacks, claiming them to be targeting “energy facilities, military administration and communications of Ukraine.”, Accountability for war crimes, Since the beginning of the conflict, Amnesty International has been documenting Russian war crimes and other violations of international human rights and humanitarian law committed during Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine. All of Amnesty International’s outputs published to date – including news updates, reports, briefings and investigations – can be found here., Amnesty International has called repeatedly for members of Russian forces and officials responsible for the aggression and violations to be held to account, and has welcomed the ongoing International Criminal Court investigation in Ukraine. Comprehensive accountability in Ukraine will require the concerted efforts of the UN and its organs, as well as initiatives at the national level pursuant to the principle of universal jurisdiction.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/russian-attacks-kyiv-and-cities-across-ukraine-are-escalation-aggression-and-apparent-violations-laws-war
Joint message from Caritas Ukraine and Caritas Spes on missile strike in Kyiv,News and Press Release,Caritas Australia,Protection and Human Rights,11 Oct 2022,"A message from Tetiana Stawnychy at Caritas Ukraine and Father Vyacheslav Grynevych at Caritas Spes-Ukraine about the missile strikes across the country last night - most devastating missile strikes since February 24. The missile strikes hit intersections, parks and tourist sites in the capital Kyiv, and further explosions were reported in Lviv, Ternopil and Zhytomyr in western Ukraine, Dnipro and Kremenchuk in the centre, Zaporizhzhia in the south and Kharkiv in the east. So far, Caritas staff have all been reported as safe., The barrage of dozens of cruise missiles fired from air, land and sea was the biggest wave of air strikes to hit locations away from the front line - at least since the initial volleys on the war's first day, February 24., Last night, massive missile strikes by Russia in Ukraine have caused devastation and loss of life across the country; killing at least 10 people and injuring over 60. Civilian infrastructure has been destroyed, with communities losing their homes, schools and medical facilities. Whole areas of large cities were without electricity, water, internet or mobile connection. The Kyiv metro once again became a shelter for people., Those affected by these strikes were ordinary people trying to go about their everyday lives; parents taking children to school; people on their way to work. People across the country, including Caritas staff, have reached out to each other, to their friends and loved ones today, to ask “are you in safety?” praying for an answer., Today’s strikes, reminiscent of February 24, have made an already difficult humanitarian situation, more acute, as the country prepares for what promise to be difficult winter months ahead., As a Caritas network we stand in prayer with those who were affected today and remain dedicated to continuing our response to the needs on the ground as we are able., Please join us in praying for an end to the violence., Tetiana Stawnychy at Caritas Ukraine and Father Vyacheslav Grynevych at Caritas Spes-Ukraine.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/joint-message-caritas-ukraine-and-caritas-spes-missile-strike-kyiv
Ukraine/Russia: Civilian lives and infrastructure must be protected [EN/RU],News and Press Release,ICRC,Protection and Human Rights,10 Oct 2022,"Geneva (ICRC) – As the international armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues, the use of explosive weapons in populated areas is putting the lives of civilians in peril. The impact of the recent attacks across Ukraine, and the armed conflict overall, continue to have the largest effect on the most vulnerable — children, the elderly, and those who are sick, wounded, or disabled. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is deeply concerned that the number of civilians killed and injured could increase., The use of explosive weapons in populated areas causes life-threatening injuries, mental and psychological harm, as well as severe damage to civilian property and infrastructure, and disruption of services essential for the civilian population, including water, electricity, sanitation, and health care. The disruption of these services ahead of/during the winter season can significantly increase humanitarian needs., Under international humanitarian law, the effects of hostilities on civilians and civilian infrastructure must be factored into all military operations. All possible measures must be taken to protect and spare civilian life and essential infrastructure like health facilities, housing, schools, power plants, and water supplies., Explosive weapons with a wide impact area should be avoided in populated areas unless sufficient mitigation measures are taken to limit their wide-area effects and the consequent risk of civilian harm., For more information, please contact:, Fatima Sator, fsator@icrc.org, +41 79 848 4908

Ukraine: Civilian casualties as of 24:00 9 October 2022 [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",10 Oct 2022,"Date: 10 October 2022, From 24 February 2022, when the Russian Federation’s armed attack against Ukraine started, to 9 October 2022, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) recorded 15,592 civilian casualties in the country: 6,221 killed and 9,371 injured. This included:, a total of 6,221 killed (2,417 men, 1,662 women, 164 girls, and 195 boys, as well as 37 children and 1,746 adults whose sex is yet unknown), a total of 9,371 injured (1,960 men, 1,441 women, 199 girls, and 277 boys, as well as 238 children and 5,256 adults whose sex is yet unknown)
o In Donetsk and Luhansk regions: 8,653 casualties (3,696 killed and 4,957 injured)
 On Government-controlled territory: 6,868 casualties (3,297 killed and 3,571 injured)
 On territory controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups: 1,785 casualties (399 killed and 1,386 injured)
o In other regions of Ukraine (the city of Kyiv, and Cherkasy, Chernihiv, IvanoFrankivsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Khmelnytskyi, Poltava, Rivne, Ternopil, Vinnytsia, Volyn, and Zhytomyr regions), which were under Government control when casualties occurred: 6,939 casualties (2,525 killed and 4,414 injured), Most of the civilian casualties recorded were caused by the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects, including shelling from heavy artillery, multiple launch rocket systems, missiles and air strikes., OHCHR believes that the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration. This concerns, for example, Mariupol (Donetsk region), Izium (Kharkiv region), Lysychansk, Popasna, and Sievierodonetsk (Luhansk region), where there are allegations of numerous civilian casualties., Civilian casualties from 1 to 9 October 2022 (individual cases verified by OHCHR), From 1 to 9 October 2022, OHCHR recorded 373 civilian casualties:, Per type of weapon/incident:, The UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine Since 2014, OHCHR has been documenting civilian casualties in Ukraine. Reports are based on information that the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) collected through interviews with victims and their relatives; witnesses; analysis of corroborating material confidentially shared with HRMMU; official records; open-source documents, photo and video materials; forensic records and reports; criminal investigation materials; court documents; reports by international and national non-governmental organisations; public reports by law enforcement and military actors; data from medical facilities and local authorities. All sources and information are assessed for their relevance and credibility and cross-checked against other information. In some instances, corroboration may take time. This may mean that conclusions on civilian casualties may be revised as more information becomes available and numbers may change as new information emerges over time. Statistics presented in the current update are based on individual civilian casualty records where the “reasonable grounds to believe” standard of proof was met, namely where, based on a body of verified information, an ordinarily prudent observer would have reasonable grounds to believe that the casualty took place as described., ENDS, Ukrainian and Russian language versions of this update as they become available, please visit this page., For more information and media requests, please contact:

High Commissioner’s opening statement to the 73rd session of the UNHCR Executive Committee (10 October 2022),News and Press Release,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,10 Oct 2022,"By Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Thank you, Mr. Chairman., Never before have we – as a human race – moved so much., So easily., We move for work; for pleasure; for curiosity; for meeting with friends or family., But how often do we really reflect on movement? Do we appreciate the ease with which many of us can choose to move?, And how much do we really – really – think about what movement – or rather flight – means for refugees? How it is for them to move in a world that too often does not want them to?, The video we just showed as you heard — co-produced and narrated by Prince, a Congolese refugee in Malawi — helps us visualize this. Their fears and their aspirations. And it highlights the importance of enabling refugee voices to be heard, and acted upon. Not just today, but all the time, until their plight is resolved., Mr Chairman, dear Salim, ministers, delegates, colleagues, friends:, Thank you for caring for the more than 100 million people – 100 million! - whom we are tasked to protect and whose plight we must ease and strive to solve., As we begin our 73rd session of the Executive Committee, I trust you will keep them at the fore and you will work towards finding solutions that have remained, for far too many and for far too long, elusive., And let me echo the Chairman and say that I hope that in your statements, you will remember that while politics are all around us, this is a non-political forum and our focus should not be on scoring political points, but on finding solutions for people like Prince and the refugees in his film., Mr Chairman,, In such a complex world, we need to work together. Unfortunately, the international community has become quite unable to do so: unable to make peace, or even prevent predictable catastrophes. To share vaccines. To reduce risks from the climate emergency. To spend a little now – money, political capital, or both – to avoid much greater expense in the future., The impact of this inaction on the world’s most vulnerable is grave. COVID, climate, conflict, and now a cost of living crisis are causing ever more hardship and — indeed, and in various ways — compelling people to flee. The demand for UNHCR’s response has never been greater, while its space to find solutions has perhaps never been smaller., While in many countries the COVID-19 pandemic is gradually being addressed, its longer term consequences continue to impact the most vulnerable, including — often — refugees and displaced people., Meanwhile, the climate emergency increasingly drives displacement, making life harder also for those already uprooted. The link between climate change and displacement is clear and growing. We see it in the Horn of Africa, for example, where people are forced to flee by a combination of conflict and drought — more than one million have been displaced in Somalia alone since January 2021. Around 80 per cent of refugees are from countries that are most affected by the climate emergency. Some 90 per cent of recent returnees have gone back to highly climate vulnerable situations. But what is their future? And what is the future of those hoping to return home? Of those, displaced or not — like I saw in Cameroon — who see their lives and livelihoods evaporate like the lakes that have nourished their families for generations?, Refugees and displaced people have an enormous stake in ensuring that bold climate action is taken but they are too often forgotten in this discussion., UNHCR, as you know, has continued to step up its climate response – strengthening legal and normative guidance to States; responding to climate induced displacement; building resilience to climate shocks in hosting areas; and taking steps to reduce our own carbon footprint, including by switching to renewable energy. Our work in the Sahel is an example of how we can use technology to improve response and preparedness., But it is clear, especially ahead of COP27, that we must all do more. Countries of origin and host communities must be able to directly access climate finance, including from the US$ 100 billion annual commitment for climate action, so that among other measures they can prevent displacement, adapt, and prepare. In turn, adaptation and preparedness plans must include the displaced — actual and potential. And please ensure that their plight is taken into consideration in Sharm el-Sheikh next month., Global inflationary pressures are also having a severe effect on the most vulnerable. Poverty and food insecurity are rising, the World Food Programme is forced to cut assistance, and some — refugees and often their hosts — are taking desperate measures because they can no longer make ends meet. Just last month, a boat with Lebanese people on board, along with Syrian and Palestinian refugees, capsized after departing Lebanon: more than 100 drowned in the Mediterranean — adding themselves to the estimated 1,630 others who have lost their lives this year alone trying to reach Europe, not to mention those who have died along other routes. Desperate living conditions often combine with conflict, violence and discrimination, in a toxic mix that leaves people with little hope for a future., While UNHCR, obviously, is unable to influence global macro-economic trends, we are doing what we can to alleviate hardship and provide opportunities. We are engaging with the International Monetary Fund, for example, so they consider forced displacement as a relevant factor in planning their support to States, especially where the percentage of refugees and their economic impact – both positive and negative – is significant., You have heard me speak many times about the progress we have made with the World Bank, bilateral donors, regional banks, and other financial institutions in providing support to refugee hosting countries that are including refugees in their national plans. The OECD estimates about US$ 3.3 billion of bilateral development funds are injected into refugee situations each year. This is in addition to around the $2 billion per year from multilateral development banks, and of course humanitarian resources mobilized by UNHCR and its partners. This must continue and grow, especially in the form of grants to bolster and support host countries and communities that are shouldering a disproportionate amount of the international community’s responsibility for refugees., We are also trying to mitigate the cost of living crisis for the displaced and host communities in other ways. Some are traditional like stepping up cash assistance, delivering relief items and providing mental health support. Some interventions reflect the big leaps we have made in the use of data and analysis thanks to our cooperation with the World Bank through the Joint Data Centre., But of course, conflict remains the biggest driver of forced displacement. Like in Myanmar where an estimated one million people have been uprooted within the country since the military takeover last February, or Burkina Faso, where 325,000 people have fled their homes this year alone – one of many deeply worrying indicators reflecting the instability in the Sahel which is displacing people not only within their countries, but beyond, including to coastal states, North Africa, and Europe., Despite UNHCR’s stretched capacity, we have responded to each of the 37 emergencies declared in the past 12 months, whether caused by conflict, climate, or frequently a combination of both – as for example in Mozambique where 125,000 people have been freshly displaced., But the Russian invasion of Ukraine has taken emergency response to new levels as it precipitated the largest and fastest displacement crisis in Europe since the Second World War, as many of us witnessed first hand at the borders of Ukraine’s neighbours in the weeks following 24 February., Displacement continues and nearly eight months later, lives and civilian infrastructure are being inexcusably destroyed., Today, is another day of anguish for the Ukrainian people., As we speak, my colleagues are reporting to me horrifying strikes on urban centres in Kyiv, Dnipro, Lviv, Zaporizhzhia, Chernihiv, Odesa, and elsewhere., UNHCR is active wherever Ukrainians have been displaced. EU Member States and other States in Europe must be commended for their exceptional leadership and cooperation in addressing the refugee crisis. We have also been engaged in countries around the world, such as in the Russian Federation., We have developed innovative responses, for example — in some European countries and in partnership with UNICEF and local authorities— through the extensive network of Blue Dot protection hubs, where refugees can seek help from staff and volunteers who identify specific needs like for separated children, women at risk including from gender-based violence, and those with trauma., We have worked with IOM, UNODC, NGO partners and authorities to counter trafficking by offering information, resources, and transportation. And we have provided cash assistance to vulnerable refugees. Cash has given them agency and choice. It is often the lifeline needed to rent an apartment, reach family or friends, or have some resources in hand to reject the advances of those with criminal intentions., This is why cash assistance is not charity, but protection. And not just for Ukrainians, but around the world., The situation inside Ukraine remains grave. At least 6.2 million people are internally displaced and many more need humanitarian support., I wish to praise the able leadership of the Ukrainian government in the humanitarian response. Our contribution, in agreement with the authorities and within the UN-coordinated operation, has focused on three pillars: protection, shelter, and cash assistance., But I share the government’s concerns about the looming winter. We will continue to work hard, but we must be realistic in our expectations. This requires an “all hands on deck” approach and I appeal to those with expertise and resources to redouble efforts in support of the government’s winterization plans. Millions of Ukrainians, especially the aged and disabled, are counting on all of us., Mr Chairman,, The response to the outflow of people from Ukraine has been nothing short of extraordinary., Moldovan generosity, for example, has been exemplary, in spite of Moldova’s big challenges., Almost half of the contributions to our appeal have come from private individuals and companies., The application of the Temporary Protection Directive within the European Union enabled millions of Ukrainians to find safety immediately and go where they had support networks, without putting pressure on asylum systems., And yes, while neighbours may be easier to receive and integrate, the Ukrainian crisis debunked so many myths that we have heard over the years from some politicians:, ‘Europe is full!’, ‘Public opinion is against taking in more refugees.’, ‘Relocation is impossible.’, Surely, last year, Europe was seemingly unable to deal with a few dozen people being disembarked from a boat., But suddenly, seven million were received with dignity and protected appropriately., Temporary protection proved to be not only a humanitarian instrument but a very effective tool to receive and include refugees: four million have now registered. The way that European governments and the European people responded proved right what this year’s Nansen Award recipient, former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said all those years ago:, Wir schaffen das. We can do it., Of course, I am not saying that everyone has a right to go wherever they wish. Many flows today are complex and an approach like temporary protection cannot be applied to every person, everywhere., I fully acknowledge also that some receiving States have big challenges handling the demands. Numbers can be large; asylum systems lack resources; and years of the public being told that things are chaotic — and at times, indeed, disorganized responses — have undermined public trust and confidence in the management of asylum; but not the concept or its importance., UNHCR is ready to support States in rebuilding that confidence with fair and fast asylum processes that enable both protection for those who need, and returns, with dignity and rights respected, of those who do not. We are reflecting and consulting and we will reach out to States with new ideas that can ensure access to territory, international protection, adherence to refugee and human rights law, while finding practical ways to address the complexity of contemporary flows., But we must equally – and forcefully – reject simplistic slogans by some politicians to respond to these challenges by building walls, either physical or procedural. We must not accept the denial of access to territory for those seeking asylum, often through violent pushbacks; we must not normalize attempts to outsource asylum responsibilities., Legally; morally; and practically I oppose efforts to evade a State’s responsibility by externalizing its asylum obligations, and I hope that those thinking of those approaches will reconsider carefully., I also reject what we have heard some politicians on this continent tell their voters: that Ukrainians are ‘real refugees’ while others – fleeing similar horrors, but from different parts of the world – are not. There is only one word to define this attitude: racist., It is also insulting to the many host countries around the world that have for years, decades, or generations provided protection and support to millions in order to live up to their responsibilities and their obligations; and to uphold a basic and fundamental morality that cuts across cultures., Mr Chairman,, As we all know, the armed conflict in Ukraine which followed the Russian invasion is having global ramifications, especially on those without the resources to cushion the blow. It is also having consequences on contributions to UNHCR., On the one hand, I must say that – like for Afghanistan last year – I am buoyed by the outpouring of support we have received from the general public, private companies, and foundations. In 2019 we raised US$421 million from private sources, increasing to US$538 million in 2020 and US$625 million last year., This year, we will exceed US$1 billion from private donors., Private companies have also - in the context of the Global Compact on Refugees – brought their innovation, knowhow, and expertise to support not just our operations, but also their own as they hire refugees. This is truly heartwarming., We have reached out to new donors, including in the area of Islamic Philanthropy. Building on the success of our Zakat and Sadaqah campaigns, I signed an agreement two weeks ago with the Islamic Solidarity Fund for Development and the Islamic Development Bank to launch the first Global Islamic Fund for Refugees. Starting from next year, the fund – which holds Sharia compliant investments – will begin generating money to support UNHCR operations., Yet despite these and other positive developments, I regret to inform you that – for the first time during my tenure – I am worried about UNHCR’s financial situation., You have encouraged us to expand our donor base - which we have - vastly exceeding targets on private contributions., But as a United Nations agency – one created by member States with a specific mandate – we cannot be reliant on the goodwill of individuals or companies alone. While of course most welcome and an area in which we will continue to invest, private contributions do not have the same predictability as those of States and are not - nor cannot be - the bedrock upon which we function., We therefore look to you, States, for support. The response by traditional donors this year has remained extremely strong and is led – once again, and by far – by the exceptional levels of financing from the United States of America, followed by Germany, whose support – in all aspects - has remained steadfast., But the Ukraine emergency has added over US$1 billion to our budget this year, bringing it to a total of US$10.7 billion., And while the Ukraine response has been and must continue to be well-funded, this has to be the target for all operations. Funding for new emergencies like Ukraine needs to be in addition to, not instead of the others., I appreciate the very real pressure on donor budgets. The hardship that is confronting citizens and taxpayers. And I acknowledge that most have made their overall Ukraine-related contributions additional. But I must report that – with the exception of a handful of donors – additionality is not always visible when it comes to specific contributions to UNHCR., I therefore appeal in the strongest of terms to all donors to please do more to support UNHCR and refugees around the world. If we do not receive at least an additional US$700 million, especially for our most underfunded operations, between now and the end of this year, we will be forced to make severe cuts with negative and sometimes dramatic consequences for refugees and host communities., And I must also remind donors of the importance of multiyear and unearmarked funding and thank Sweden and Norway for continuing to lead in this regard. Just 12 per cent of UNHCR’s government income is unearmarked, limiting how we can manage expenditure across the world and respond effectively to new emergencies., Because we cannot pay attention only to the latest crisis at the expense of the rest., This year is Ukraine., But last year was Afghanistan, where millions, including women, girls, and minorities, continue to need urgent help inside the country and in neighbouring Pakistan and Iran., Our operations in Ethiopia were in focus before Afghanistan, and are now just 46 per cent funded, although after the resumption of hostilities in September humanitarian conditions are deteriorating again., Support was strong in the years following the initial displacement of Rohingya refugees. Last year’s Joint Response Plan was 72 per cent funded. It stands at just 30 per cent, with dramatic cuts to programming on the horizon from all UN agencies and NGOs operating in Bangladesh unless donors provide, urgently, more help., Uganda hosts over 1.5 million refugees and has very generous refugee policies. Yet, our operation there faces a huge financial gap and we struggle to help the 110,000 Congolese and South Sudanese refugees who have arrived this year alone., In the Sahel, people have been subjected to extreme violence as well as the climate emergency — yet, the funding shortfall is preventing us from delivering shelter and compromising our protection work to counter widespread gender-based violence., And let’s not forget the millions of Syrian refugees and displaced – about the same number as displaced Ukrainians. The funding shortfall affecting operations in support of Syrians are especially worrying., We continue to work inside Syria to remove the obstacles to return — especially those frequently mentioned by refugees. We will continue to discuss with the government how to strengthen humanitarian access to those in need, including displaced and returnees. However, our work is poorly funded, limiting the humanitarian and early recovery response which we conduct in Syria also in the framework of Security Council Resolution 2642., At the same time, funding to the refugee response in neighbouring countries is at its lowest level ever., This situation is further worsened by the fact that host communities are also suffering the effects of the economic downturn, especially in Lebanon. Let us not forget that Lebanon and Jordan host the highest percentage of refugees per capita and Türkiye remains the largest host country in the world. This situation is untenable and we must ensure both adequate funding in host countries, and a renewed focus on resolving more than 11 years of Syrian displacement., This, Mr Chairman, is a plea to all — donors, hosts, countries of origin, international organisations, development partners, and each of us as global citizens: if we do not maintain focus on all crises; if we do not adequately resource all responses, we are dooming refugees and their hosts to further hardship, loss of hope and the risk of onward movement., This effort must also include searching for solutions, no matter how difficult they might be. In some places, this may mean supporting countries of origin as well as refugees who choose – voluntarily – to return, even to difficult, imperfect conditions., Do not get me wrong – I will never – NEVER – advocate or acquiesce to inducing or pushing refugees back. But the reality is that regardless of what we say, some refugees do return to conditions that are less than — or even far from — ideal., It is therefore incumbent upon us not to be paralyzed by politics, but to help people restart their lives if — and I repeat: if — they make the choice to return., Countries of origin have the biggest responsibility in creating conditions for safe return, but it also takes all of us to work together. And when we do, it can happen., I spent World Refugee Day this year in Côte d’Ivoire, a country that emerged from years of civil strife during which hundreds of thousands of its citizens fled into exile. It was not easy of course – reconciliation never is – but Ivorian leaders worked for peace, with international support. And as a result, the countries of the region that had protected and helped refugees for years declared — upon our recommendation — the cessation clause for Ivorian refugees. Some 96 per cent of the refugees have now returned home, and Ivorians that have chosen to stay abroad are being regularized by host countries., Côte d’Ivoire is perhaps the best, but not the only example, and we cooperate with countries of asylum and origin elsewhere., For example, we continue to work on the Solutions Strategy for Sudan and South Sudan: despite challenges, more than 600,000 people have returned to South Sudan in recent years., I also see, following my visit to Tanzania, potential for solutions for Burundian refugees there, subject to more support inside Burundi — although I must express grave concern for the violent and fragile situation in the sub-region, including the displacement of 150,000 people within and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo this year, in a context of unimaginable violence, especially against women., My thanks also go to countries that have hosted and regularized Venezuelan refugees and migrants. Colombia led by establishing an effective temporary protection system. Regularization operations there, and now elsewhere, such as in Ecuador, are progressing fast. At the same time we look forward to renewed dialogue with Venezuela to address the underlying causes of movements from that country., In the Americas, we can also draw lessons from the regional approach taken by the MIRPS support platform, with a stronger focus on solutions. Work in the region will be hopefully buoyed by the Los Angeles Declaration; another important step to consolidate protection and the quest for solutions throughout the hemisphere., And we must step up work to seek solutions for internally displaced people, building on the report of the High Level Panel established by the Secretary-General, and his Action Agenda on Internal Displacement. Now that principles and approaches are clear, we must get down to concrete work, starting from countries where solutions may be at hand., And we must continue to make progress in the eradication of statelessness. I welcome the Philippines’ accession to the 1961 Convention. Liberia, which I visited recently, removed gender-discriminatory provisions from its nationality law. Turkmenistan, Albania, and the Netherlands established statelessness determination procedures. While 81,000 formerly stateless people were granted nationality in 2021, we are still far from eradicating this deprivation of rights. I appeal to all States to adopt the necessary laws, policies, and practices to help bring millions more out of the shadows of statelessness before the end of the iBelong campaign in 2024., And talking of solutions, we must not forget the importance of building the capacity of individuals. One of the best ways is through education. We must all follow through on the conclusions of the Transforming Education Summit held at the UN General Assembly last month, especially with regard to investing in educational opportunities for refugees. The progress we have made must be sustained, despite the many pressing challenges., And third country solutions for refugees are also critical., I am heartened by the return of the United States to the top of the table for resettlement places and thank Canada and Sweden for also leading the way. I’m grateful to Norway and Finland for receiving emergency resettlement cases. This gesture has saved many, many lives., I am pleased that the global figure of resettled refugees has increased with 76,500 submissions already this year and counting. I encourage all countries with means to expand resettlement, and appeal that they do so separately and in addition to other programmes such as relocation or humanitarian evacuations. Further opportunities for complementary pathways — such as done in Canada — and family reunification — where Germany shows the way — are also important., Mr Chairman,, UNHCR is well aware of the need to continuously improve its effectiveness, efficiency, and fairness., In 2016, we launched a transformation process which has not only seen regionalization and decentralization of decision making, but also reform of business processes. While COVID led to some delays, we have made strides. Recruitment has been delegated, we cut back on policies and extended multi-year planning to more operations. We are rolling out this week our new human resources system, called WorkDay, which will facilitate processes, with all data centralized and interoperable in the cloud., We have overhauled and simplified our partnership management processes - US$1.4 billion worth of our annual expenditure., This will have many advantages, for example expanding partnerships with national NGOs and refugee-led organisations that do not have the capacity to handle heavy proposals and reporting requirements, so that together we spend time and resources not on paperwork, but rather on delivering the best possible programmes to refugees., COMPASS, our new results-based monitoring system, has enabled multiyear strategies, which means that we can better sequence and plan over the medium and long term in order to achieve lasting and transformative results., And one more example: our innovative fleet management system, developed with the World Food Programme and now available to all agencies, is leading the UN system in saving money, miles, and reducing our collective carbon footprint., We have reported to you in previous meetings our work to eradicate sexual exploitation and abuse and sexual harassment. This remains a priority for senior management and me personally, as does achieving gender parity and geographic and racial diversity throughout the organization., We have also continued to strengthen risk management, investigation capacity, and oversight, while at the same time implementing an alternative dispute resolution mechanism for issues that fall more in the realm of management, rather than misconduct., All of these reforms are important but are not yet complete., The need to bring them to reasonable outcomes after the slowdown caused by COVID-19, and the fact that humanitarian and refugee emergencies continue to grow, led as you heard from the Chairman by the Secretary-General to propose extending my mandate for a full second term, till the end of 2025. Thank you for accepting this proposal. Your support is encouraging and your trust both humbling and gratifying., I take it not as a personal recognition, however, but rather as an endorsement of what I often hear from States, partners and most importantly refugees: that UNHCR is not just relevant, but effective; and that my colleagues are committed and caring — and no matter the challenge, they deliver for those we serve, alongside their State and civil society partners — colleagues and partners whom I would like here to thank most sincerely., Mr Chairman,, It has been nearly four years since Member States affirmed the Global Compact on Refugees. Much, as I have outlined above, has been achieved since then., We have enhanced responses; established support platforms; mainstreamed cooperation with development actors around the world. We have truly brought about in many situations a “whole of society” response that includes citizens, companies, academics, the sport community, religious actors and others in the service of refugees and their hosts., We had a successful Global Refugee Forum in 2019., But we still have a long way to go., In a little more than one year, we will have our second Forum. I am thankful that Switzerland will again graciously co-host the event and am pleased to announce that Colombia, France, Japan, Jordan, Niger, and Uganda will co-convene the meeting alongside UNHCR. I thank the outgoing co-convenors – Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Germany, Pakistan and Türkiye – also for the follow up on pledge implementation., We have 14 months until that event. 14 months to make progress. To make good on the pledges of the last Forum and prepare the ground for more pledges at the next., And the redoubling of that action, that drive and determination to help, to assist, and mostly to resolve, must be done together — as United Nations — and that must start today., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/high-commissioners-opening-statement-73rd-session-unhcr-executive-committee-10-october-2022

Water and telecommunications services have also been affected in some areas., The wave of attacks, claimed by Russia, has also impacted humanitarian operations across Ukraine, particularly hampering the movement of aid workers and delivery of emergency supplies in the east of the country, where people are in desperate need of assistance., The UN and humanitarian partners are committed to stay and continue our work to save lives and support people whose lives have been upended by the war. Humanitarian operations will continue., SITUATION OVERVIEW, A wave of missile attacks and other airstrikes on large urban centres in Ukraine this morning have left scores of civilians killed and injured and key infrastructure damaged across most regions of the country, including the capital Kyiv. The escalation of Russia's war on Ukraine comes just a couple of days after the Kerch Strait bridge, which connects the annexed Crimean peninsula with the Russian Federation territory, was reportedly damaged over the weekend., Schools across the whole country were closed, and hundreds of thousands of families were left without power supplies in eastern Kharkivska, western Lvivska, central Poltavska, northern Sumska and western Ternopilska oblasts, according to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine. Water and telecommunications services have also been affected in some regions. The wave of attacks, claimed by Russia, has also impacted humanitarian operations across Ukraine, particularly hampering the movement of aid workers and delivery of emergency supplies in the east of the country, where people are already in desperate need of assistance., In Kyiv, a series of explosions since early hours in the morning were reported in central districts of the capital, including near to the Shevchenko University, when students were going to classes and people commuting to work. By noon, 5 civilians had reportedly been killed and nearly 50 more injured, according to preliminary data shared by the Ministry of Interior Affairs. This was the first missile attack on the capital since late June and forced the city authorities to stop the movement of some metro lines and convert the stations into shelters for the population. Critical infrastructure, including some civilian buildings, a pedestrian bridge, and parts of Shevchenko park, were damaged during the strikes, and emergency services are working to rescue survivors., In Kharkiv city and parts of Kharkivska oblast in eastern Ukraine, energy systems were reportedly damaged, leaving the population also without water due to the lack of electricity to operate the pumps. The situation is similar in Dnipro, an important humanitarian hub in **central Ukraine, **where a missile attack left an unspecified number of civilian casualties. Water and electricity services are affected in parts of the city and other towns across Dnipropetrovska oblast, including Kryvyi Rih, a hub from where aid organizations position supplies for the humanitarian response in areas of Khersonska oblast where Ukraine recently regained control., In the south, the situation is particularly concerning in Zaporizka oblast, where several missiles overnight have reportedly hit residential buildings and power lines. Yesterday 9 October, more than a dozen civilians were reportedly killed and over 50 -- including above 10 children -- injured during overnight strikes that damaged or destroyed dozens of homes in the city. Over the past few days, the administrative centre, Zaporizhzhia, has been impacted almost daily, leaving scores of civilians killed and injured and civilian infrastructure, including homes, schools, kindergartens damaged., Still in southern Ukraine, a university, residential houses and warehouses were reportedly hit in Mykolaivcity, although no casualties reported. In the neighobouring Odeska oblast, some missiles and drones were reportedly intercepted or destroyed, according to the authorities., In western Ukraine, several missile strikes were reported in Lviv city and across the oblast, reportedly targeting energy infrastructure, according to humanitarian security reports and the authorities. In the neighbouring Ivano-Frankivska, Khmelnytska and Ternopilska oblasts, attacks also targeted energy systems, according to the oblast authorities., In northern Zhytomyrska, Rivnenskaand Sumska oblasts, attacks reportedly damaged energy facilities, disrupting power and water supplies in some areas, according to the authorities., The new escalation of Russia's war on Ukraine comes at a time when nearly 18 million people across the country are already facing life-threatening humanitarian needs following nearly eight months of ferocious fighting., HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE, Government, volunteer groups, local and international aid organizations across Ukraine are working against the clock to mobilize assistance and support people impacted by the latest attacks. In Kyiv, rescue teams are evacuating people from areas that have been hit and providing first aid with the support of the Ukrainian Red Cross Society Rapid Response Unit. In Kharkiv and other areas, authorities have already started reparations to water and energy networks, while the NGO Mission Proliska, funded by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), distributed emergency shelter kits in Zaporizhzhia yesterday. The humanitarian community will work to provide emergency supplies -- including through using pre-positioned relief items in different parts of the country -- to the people most affected by the strikes., For more information, please contact OCHA Ukraine:, Saviano Abreu*, *deabreuisidoro@un.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-escalation-attacks-across-country-flash-update-no1-enruuk
Update 115 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (9 Oct 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,9 Oct 2022,"Ukrainian engineers restored external power to the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) today, a day after the facility lost the connection to its last remaining operating power line due to shelling, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said., After the repair work was successfully completed, the 750 kilovolt (kV) line was reconnected to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in the evening, enabling it to start switching off the emergency diesel generators that had provided it with back-up electricity since the connection was cut early on Saturday., The plant’s six reactors are in cold shutdown but still require power for cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions., Director General Grossi, who received news about the restored off-site power from the team of IAEA nuclear safety, security and safeguards experts present at the plant site, said it was a much-needed development but that the power situation at the ZNPP remained fragile., Also today, the Director General condemned military attacks in areas that could affect the safety and security of ZNPP, including in the cities of Enerhodar and Zaporizhzhya., “Almost every day now, there is shelling in the region where the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant is located and where the plant workers and their families live. The shelling must stop, immediately. It is already having an impact on the nuclear safety and security situation at the plant,” he said., In recent days, there has been frequent shelling in an industrial area between the ZNPP and Enerhodar. There have also been missile strikes further away, including the tragic one on Sunday in the city of Zaporizhzhya. A convoy of five trucks carrying vital additional diesel fuel supplies for the ZNPP is currently in the city, planning to cross the frontline to reach the plant tomorrow, senior Ukrainian operating staff told the IAEA experts at the site. The site’s current diesel reserves last for about 10 days., “These military attacks in Zaporizhzhya and its vicinity increase the risk of a nuclear accident, if they hit the plant’s external power lines or make it more difficult to deliver vital supplies of fuel and equipment,” Director General Grossi said., The Director General has proposed the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP, engaging in high-level talks with Ukraine and the Russian Federation aimed at agreeing and implementing such a zone as soon as possible., Further highlighting the potential risks to the plant, a landmine exploded in the afternoon today outside its perimeter fence, the team of IAEA experts were informed at the site, the latest in a series of such blasts over the past few weeks., Separately, a supply of diesel fuel provided by the Russian state nuclear company Rosatom has arrived in Enerhodar.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-115-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-9-oct-2022

Update 114 – IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (8 Oct 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,8 Oct 2022,"The nuclear safety and security situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) has deteriorated further, with the facility losing all access to external power due to renewed shelling overnight, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today., The shelling damaged the ZNPP’s last remaining operating 750 kilovolt (kV) power line shortly after midnight, forcing Europe’s largest nuclear power plant to rely on its emergency diesel generators for the electricity it needs for reactor cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions, Director General Grossi said, citing information from the IAEA team of experts present at the site., While those generators have fuel for ten days the lack of off-site electricity is a deeply worrying development that underlines the urgent need to establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP, the Director General said., “The resumption of shelling, hitting the plant’s sole source of external power, is tremendously irresponsible. The Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant must be protected,” he said., As part of efforts to agree and implement such a zone as soon as possible, the Director General held talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Thursday and he will also discuss the issue in the Russian Federation early next week, before returning to Ukraine., The protection zone “is an absolute and urgent imperative” in order to prevent a nuclear accident, he said., A secure off-site power supply from the grid is essential for ensuring nuclear safety. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict., Before the conflict, the ZNPP had access to the grid through four high-voltage power lines, but they have now all fallen victim to the fighting. The back-up power lines connecting the ZNPP to a nearby thermal power station are also down. The plant had also previously temporarily lost direct access to the electricity grid but could then still receive power through available back-up lines, or from one of its reactors that was still operating at the time., The loss of external power comes a day after the IAEA experts at the ZNPP reported that shelling had damaged a power line providing electricity to the plant’s reactor unit 6, which temporarily received power from its emergency diesel generators instead. Yesterday, the nearby city of Enerhodar – where the ZNPP’s staff and their families live – lost electricity after shelling damaged an electrical transformer at the thermal power station, and shelling continued today at the industrial site outside the nuclear power plant site., After the connection to the 750 kV line was lost early today, all sixteen of the plant’s available diesel generators started operating automatically, providing its six reactors with power. When the situation stabilised, ten of the generators were switched off, leaving six to provide the reactors with electricity. Efforts are under way to increase the available fuel stocks for the diesel generators., All the plant’s safety systems continue to receive power and are operating normally, the IAEA experts were informed by senior Ukrainian operating staff at the site. Although the six reactors are in cold shutdown, they still require electricity for vital nuclear safety and security functions., The location of the damage to the 750 kV power line has been identified outside the ZNPP site and it will be repaired by the grid operator, the IAEA expert team reported. A damaged electrical transformer at the switchyard of the thermal power station will also be repaired, but the timing depends on the shelling in the area. The IAEA team was also informed that the electricity connection between the ZNPP’s own switchyard and reactor unit 6 had been fixed., Senior operating staff at the ZNPP had informed the IAEA team on Wednesday about plans to re-start reactor unit 5 at reduced power to produce steam and heat for the needs of the plant, but those preparations were halted after the plant lost all external power.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-114-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-8-oct-2022

After the situation stabilised, ten of the generators were switched off, leaving six to provide the reactors with necessary electricity., “The resumption of shelling, hitting the plant’s sole source of external power, is tremendously irresponsible. The Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant must be protected,” Director General Grossi said. “I will soon travel to the Russian Federation, and then return to Ukraine, to agree on a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the plant.

Update 113 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (7 Oct 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,7 Oct 2022,"Shelling damaged a power line providing electricity to reactor unit 6 at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) yesterday, forcing the unit to temporarily rely on its emergency diesel generators instead, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was informed by senior Ukrainian operating personnel at the site today., Five diesel generators started supplying power to this reactor after its connection to a 150 kilovolt (kV) back-up line was cut during the shelling that occurred in an industrial area outside the ZNPP site. They operated for about an hour and a half, while an alternative source of power from four of the other reactors was connected to the unit, whose core cooling was maintained at all times., The incident once again underlined the precarious nuclear safety and security situation at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant – now located in an active war zone – and especially the fragile and vulnerable supplies of external power that are needed for cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions, also during the current cold shutdown of all the plant’s six reactors., The ZNPP only has one direct high-voltage external power line available – out of four such lines before the conflict – and its connection to reactor unit 6 was lost in shelling on 21 September. Also at that time, the unit temporarily received electricity from its diesel generators before it could again access external power, indirectly through the switchyard of a nearby thermal power station and a back-up 150 kV line. That 150 kV line was the one that was damaged yesterday, causing a second interruption in electricity supplies to this reactor in just over two weeks., “Again and again, the plant’s courageous, skilled and experienced operators find solutions to overcome the severe problems that keep occurring because of the conflict. However, this is not a sustainable way to run a nuclear power plant. There is an urgent need to create a more stable environment for the plant and its staff,” Director General Grossi said., The Director General was in Kyiv yesterday for talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky on the situation at the ZNPP and the IAEA’s proposal to set up a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the facility. He will travel to the Russian Federation early next week for further consultations on the plan, with the aim to agree and implement it as soon as possible., Maintaining and expanding the IAEA’s presence at the ZNPP, four IAEA nuclear safety, security and safeguards experts crossed the frontline and arrived at the plant today to replace their two colleagues who have stayed and worked at the site since 1 September, when Director General Grossi travelled to the facility to establish the IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) there. The experts are providing independent and impartial observations and assessments of the situation at the plant. They will also provide support to the nuclear safety and security protection zone once it is agreed., “Today’s rotation underlines our determination that the IAEA will stay at the plant as long as it is required. Their presence is necessary to help stabilize the situation, which remains very difficult and volatile. I’m immensely grateful to our two experts who have been on the plant for over five weeks, and to the four that are there now. This is crucial work that they are doing in very challenging circumstances and we are very proud of them,” Director General Grossi said., The ZNPP has been controlled by Russian forces since early March. Over the past seven months, its Ukrainian operating staff have worked to prevent a nuclear accident during the current military conflict, in extremely difficult conditions with frequent shelling at the plant or near it.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-113-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-7-oct-2022

Protection and Human Rights",7 Oct 2022,"URGENT CALL TO ACTION REGARDING UKRAINIAN CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES IN RESIDENTIAL CARE INSTITUTIONS., The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) are gravely concerned about the thousands of Ukrainian children with disabilities who were living in residential institutions and have been evacuated from war zones to Western Ukraine or to other countries – as well as those who have remained in unsafe areas. In particular, the Committees draws attention to children with high support requirements who are severely adversely affected by institutionalization., Evacuated children, The Committees support the effort of the Ukrainian government to ensure evacuated children do not go missing, are not adopted by persons in other countries and will return to Ukraine once the war is over. In this regard, the Committees note the moratorium on inter-country adoption under the conditions of Martial Law., However, the Ukrainian government regulation stipulating that all children evacuated from institutions – within Ukraine or to other countries – must remain together in those groups, results in the continued institutionalization of children, in overcrowded and understaffed facilities that cannot provide children with adequate care and exposes them to high risk of harm., This policy is also hindering continued efforts to evacuate children from institutions, as some potential hosting countries are unable to comply with the government decision., Children with high support requirements and the risk of death, Furthermore, the Committees are gravely concerned for the safety of children with disabilities and high support requirements. Due to the particular neglect associated with institutionalization, these children are likely to be susceptible to respiratory and malnutritionrelated illnesses. As temperatures in Ukraine are expected to start dropping in October and considering the extent of the war damage upon gas, electricity and heating infrastructure, those children who remain in understaffed, underserviced and overcrowded institutions in Ukraine, are subjected to a disproportional risk of mortality., The Committees call upon all actors to work urgently to address these concerns and reduce the risk of death, trafficking and abuse of Ukrainian children with disabilities in institutions., Specifically:, The Committees call upon the government of Ukraine to:, Repeal the state regulations that stipulate evacuated children must remain together in groups and prioritise the development of family care for all children from institutions, including children with disabilities;, Immediately organize individual support needs assessments for children, including for those with high support requirements who remain in institutions in Ukraine; work with international partners to develop a plan to evacuate children with disabilities from risk areas and accommodate them in accessible shelters and family settings; extend and strengthen community-based services to mitigate the risk of severe harm to and mortality of children with disabilities;, Prioritise family reunification and the development of temporary foster family care for all children currently living in institutions., The Committees call upon the governments of all countries hosting children with disabilities who were evacuated from Ukrainian institutions to:, Fully include all children evacuated from the Ukrainian residential care system in their national child protection systems and ensure they are provided access to care, protection, health and education services on an equal basis with others;, Immediately organize individual support needs assessments for children, including for those with high support requirements who were evacuated from Ukraine and accommodate them in accessible shelters and family settings; and implement individual plans to develop communitybased services that are available and accessible to Ukrainian children with disabilities;, Invest urgently in the development of a temporary foster family programme for Ukrainian refugee children currently living in institutional settings, with a preference for assigning foster families from the Ukrainian diaspora and refugee communities, and ensuring continued access to the children’s language and culture., The Committees call upon UNICEF, WHO, UNHCR, ICRC, the European Union and donors to:, Support the Ukrainian government and the governments of hosting countries – through the provision of expertise and resources – to undertake an urgent assessment of individual support needs for Ukrainian children with disabilities, including high support requirements living in institutions;, Support the development of a plan to evacuate children with disabilities from risk areas and accommodate them in accessible shelters and family settings; and to extend and strengthen community-based services to mitigate the risk of severe harm to and mortality of children with disabilities, particularly during the upcoming winter months;, Provide timely funding and expertise to Ukraine and hosting countries to develop a temporary foster family care programme for children evacuated from Ukrainian institutions, including children with disabilities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/joint-statement-committee-rights-child-and-committee-rights-persons-disabilities-ukrainian-children-disabilities

A Revision of the Appeal will be concluded in Q4 2022., SUMMARY, This report summarizes six months of developments in the impact that the conflict exerted on millions of lives, and the response of the IFRC network to provide humanitarian assistance to people affected by this crisis. Following the immediate response triggered across the network to react to the needs generated by mass displacement and the immediate impact of the conflict, operations in all impacted countries continue to scale up, while adapting to the changing context and scenarios – such as the evolving energy crisis, inflation and incoming winter period - as well as gearing up for sustained, targeted and impactful long-term programs., The IFRC Network’s response continues to expand geographically, as well as in and programmatic scope, with the overall focus of the network primarily revolving around: providing scalable and adaptable cash assistance; health programming with special emphasis on mental health and psychosocial support; assistance to cover needs in shelter with current focus on winterization preparedness; addressing humanitarian concerns in protection and education., While continuing to respond with and increased impact, the operation has been fostering innovative approaches, especially in the field of multi-purpose cash distributions. With support from the IFRC, digitalized, data and usercentered, quickly scalable solutions were piloted in multiple countries, leading to exponential growth in our capacities to reach people in need. Building digital solutions also enhanced our abilities to continuously monitor, respond and be accountable towards feedback from the communities we serve., Scaling up humanitarian operations and preparing for sustained programming is paired with strengthening the capacities of responding National Societies in their human resources and management capacities, logistics, digitalization and information management, as well as strengthening local branches embedded in communities.
To ensure a harmonized approach focusing on needs and maximizing impact, the IFRC Secretariat coordinated the mobilization of an unprecedented scale of personnel from across the globe, guided operations and strategies, and established mechanisms and fora for coordinating support from its Membership across all levels., A Federation-wide approach ensures that all responding – and supporting – National Societies are represented and integrated.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/europe-ukraine-and-impacted-countries-crisis-emergency-appeal-no-mgr65002-operation-update-4-07-october-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",7 Oct 2022,"OVERVIEW, The Ukrainian military launched a counteroffensive in Kharkiv oblast on 6 September, aiming to reclaim the northern and eastern areas of the oblast that were under Russian military control. In the following two weeks, Ukrainian forces regained control over 8,000km2 of territory with a population of around 150,000 people (NP 23/09/2022; The Guardian 14/09/2022; Al Jazeera 14/09/2022; Ukrainska Pravda 13/09/2022; RFE/RL 14/09/2022)., The change in control has made many areas newly accessible, making humanitarian access possible. That said, actual access still depends on several factors, including the proximity of communities to main tarmac roads, landmine decontamination, the availability of up-to-date information, administrative barriers, and whether military checkpoints allow the passage of humanitarian assistance., Access to services and building materials is a main immediate concern for the population as winter approaches. Prolonged fighting has resulted in extensive damage to infrastructure, particularly power plants, causing disruptions to services (including water, electricity, gas, heating, and telecommunications). Some of the main immediate needs are power generators and building materials for the reconstruction of houses and critical infrastructure., Food, medicines, and drinking water are also some of the main needs resulting from a lack of stock, high prices, and a lack of livelihoods.
Volunteers and local NGOs are the most active sources of humanitarian assistance in the area. They have reached the highest number of settlements among all responders and distributed aid in some of the main cities (Balakliia, Izium, and Kupiansk). Less humanitarian aid is getting to the villages or inside the raions outside the big cities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acaps-thematic-report-ukraine-humanitarian-situation-newly-accessible-areas-kharkiv-oblast-06-october-2022

However, the programme has been adapted: construction work in occupied areas or those near the front line has been stopped, while work continues in relatively safe locations. And: about 1600 internally displaced persons - families and also orphans from contested areas - are being accommodated in nine vocational schools. Dormitories are being set up there and equipped with the bare necessities: in June 2022, 492 beds, 400 mattresses and mattress covers, 680 pillows and blankets, 1,710 sets of bed linen, 19 washing machines, 18 refrigerators, 12 microwaves and 14 multi-cookers were delivered. Sounds banal - but for the refugees, this makes ""everyday life"" possible., The project's executing agency - the ""Ukrainian Social Investment Fund"" - also plans to provide emergency aid to the institutions to renew the quality of the educational process: necessary equipment, materials for laboratories, workshops, etc. worth a total of EUR 350,000 will be purchased. This is because companies in Ukraine will be dependent on a qualified workforce both during and after the war. Only a modern vocational training infrastructure is attractive for students and creates the basis for effective, needs-based training., A total of 15 vocational schools are to be modernised as part of the project. The schools focus on agriculture and the production and processing of agricultural products, industry and mechanical engineering, construction and utilities, and transport and communications. In addition, there are training courses for the textile industry, shoe industry, CRAFT technologies, folk crafts and handicrafts, as well as for household and catering services. The budget from the EU mandate is EUR 19 million., Dr Anna-Maria von Roda, Portfolio Manager in charge at KfW Development Bank, on a very recent development: ""Today I received another request from the Ukrainian Ministry of Education for another IDP Emergency Package. The dormitories of the ""Nova Odesa Higher Professional Agrarian Lyceum"" school serve as accommodation for 38 IDPs and 19 orphans.

Protection and Human Rights",7 Oct 2022,"Over the course of summer 2022, Spilno Camp took place in three areas of Ukraine’s Zakarpattia region – in Svalyava, Irshava and Uzhgorod. More than 6,000 displaced and local children and youth living in Zakarpattya participated. Most of the displaced came from the Donetsk, Kyiv, Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions., The project was launched by NGO Cultural Platform Zakarpattya, in partnership with the Zakarpattya Regional State Administration and local authorities, with the support of UNICEF Ukraine., The main goal of Spilno Camp was to promote social cohesion between displaced populations and host communities, as well as helping children to adapt to difficult situations. In addition, project participants received useful knowledge and creative skills from leading experts., Working with lecturers and mentors from the creative sector, children and young people learned to create their own stories and videos, tried themselves in the role of directors, actors, journalists, designers, firefighters and even mayors. Each cycle of thematic classes was a combination of theoretical and practical knowledge, on the basis of which children and teenagers created their own content., The results of their work with mentors included videos, posters and billboards, music tracks and NFT. The children discussed topics including nutrition, health, hygiene, vaccination, mine safety, democracy, equality and environmental protection., Camp activities were designed to help children and youth to adapt, as well as the formation of positive relationships with peers and parents., Spilno Camp also featured over 30 sports leagues, jointly launched with the All-Ukraine movement of Oleksandr Pedan Junior, over 20 movie screenings from Planeta Kino and more than 300 master classes from leading experts in the innovative sector and creative economy., Since February 24, Zakarpattya has sheltered over 400,000 Ukrainians who have fled from active hostilities.

Staff at the plant are being forced to make a hugely difficult decision for themselves and their loved ones. The enormous pressure they are facing must stop,” he said., Europe’s largest nuclear power plant is held by Russian forces but is operated by its Ukrainian staff. Over the past seven months, the staff have continued to conduct their important duties in order to prevent the danger of a nuclear accident during the current military conflict, in extremely challenging circumstances with frequent shelling at the plant or near it., “The plant’s courageous staff deserve our sincere gratitude and respect for continuing to fulfil their vital tasks in unimaginably difficult conditions, with their workplace located in the middle of a war zone. There is a need for urgent action to make their jobs and lives easier, not the opposite,” Director General Grossi said., The Director General, who has repeatedly expressed grave concern about the stressful and challenging working conditions at the ZNPP, said the psychological impact on staff was detrimental to nuclear safety and security., The latest developments risk exacerbating the situation by leading to confusion on who is charge as well as ambiguity about the command-and-control chain at the plant, he said., This week’s developments could have a direct impact on several of the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars the Director General outlined in March, including one stating that “operating staff must be able to fulfil their safety and security duties and have the capacity to make decisions free of undue pressure” and another saying, “there must be reliable communications with the regulator and others”., Separately today, the IAEA team at the ZNPP reported that there had been shelling in an industrial area close to the access road to the plant.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iaea-director-general-grossi-and-ukrainian-president-zelensky-meet-kyiv-discuss-situation-znpp-enru

Ukrainian forces also continued counteroffensive operations in the Kherson region, shelling Russian positions and re-supply routes., Following widely discredited “referendums” the week prior, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson as part of Russia on 30 September (Wall Street Journal, 30 September 2022). Despite the claim, Russia did not clearly define the borders of the annexed territory, as Russian forces do not have full control over these areas (ISW, 30 September 2022). Some analysts suggest that one of the goals of the annexation is to allow the Kremlin to conscript Ukrainian civilians in the occupied territories (ISW, 26 September 2022). Much of the international community condemned the annexation and refused to recognize any potential changes to Ukrainian borders (Al Jazeera, 1 October 2022; Reuters, 30 September 2022)., Meanwhile, Russian forces also continued to target civilian infrastructure with shelling, missiles, and airstrikes, killing over 60 civilians last week.

Office of Press Relations
press@usaid.gov, Today in Ukraine, Administrator Samantha Power announced a $55 million investment in Ukraine’s heating infrastructure to aid the country’s preparations for winter amid the Russian Federation’s brutal war. This assistance will support repairs and maintenance of pipes and other equipment necessary to deliver heating to homes, hospitals, schools, and businesses across Ukraine., The new USAID assistance will directly benefit up to seven million Ukrainians in 19 regions. USAID will also provide power generators and alternative fuel sources to hospitals, centers for internally-displaced persons, and shelters for socially vulnerable citizens, helping provide the people of Ukraine with access to warm shelter during winter. The assistance will target parts of Ukraine that have been devastated by Putin’s war, including the regions of Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Zaporizhzhya, and Zhytomyr., The new funding comes in addition to significant USAID assistance to Ukraine’s energy sector since the start of the Russian Federation’s full-scale invasion and will help Ukraine ensure continued supplies of heating and hot water to its citizens. Under the initiative, USAID has already provided heating pipes and other equipment to help restore services to 22,000 people in Kyiv who had lost access due to the Russian military’s destruction of civilian infrastructure., The assistance is being delivered through USAID’s Energy Security Project. The five-year activity aims to help Ukraine build a more secure and transparent energy sector that ensures stable and affordable supplies to citizens while reducing the country’s dependence on Russian gas and electricity. Since the start of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, USAID has helped Ukraine connect its electricity grid with the European electricity system, allowing Ukraine to export electricity to the European Union for the first time., The U.S. government has responded to the Russian Federation’s brutal war against Ukraine by delivering $8.5 billion in direct budget support to the Government of Ukraine to help maintain critical government services, such as paying salaries of first responders, meeting pension obligations, and maintaining hospitals. In addition, the U.S. government has provided $1.5 billion in humanitarian assistance to millions of persons, both in Ukraine and in neighboring countries, since February 2022., In addition to strengthening Ukraine’s energy security during wartime, USAID assistance helps farmers in Ukraine to continue growing food for domestic and global markets, supports Ukrainian efforts to document and seek accountability for war crimes and human rights abuses, fills key gaps in Ukraine’s health system, including supporting the delivery of 53 million doses of PEPFAR-funded antiretroviral drugs for 150,000 people across Ukraine living with HIV/AIDs, as well as nearly one million additional doses of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines, and helps local government bodies in 91 communities respond to challenges caused by Putin’s brutal invasion.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/united-states-announces-55-million-emergency-assistance-help-ukraine-prepare-winter

The ""partial mobilization"" in Russia continued to drive demonstration activity in the country, as well as an increase in attacks on military recruitment centers. Clashes along the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact continued. Meanwhile, the death of Mahsa Amini in Iran and rising living costs continued to spark demonstrations across Europe. Pro-choice rallies were also held in the region, coinciding with International Safe Abortion Day on 28 September. In Italy, the victory of the far-right coalition in Italy's general elections triggered protests across the country., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. Ukrainian forces made advances in the area of Lyman in the Donetsk region throughout the week1 and recaptured several settlements in the Kupiansk and Izium districts of the Kharkiv region. Ukrainian forces also continued counteroffensive operations in the Kherson region, shelling Russian positions and re-supply routes., Russian forces also continued to target civilian infrastructure with shelling, missiles, and airstrikes, killing over 60 civilians last week.2 In Zaporizhia, Russian forces carried out a missile strike at a civilian evacuation column on 30 September, killing 30 people and wounding almost 100 (Ukrayinska Pravda, 30 September 2022)., Following the so-called ""referendums"" on 23-27 September, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed four Ukrainian regions -- Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson -- as part of Russia on 30 September (Wall Street Journal, 30 September 2022). Despite this, Russia did not clearly define the borders of the annexed territory, as its forces do not have full control over any of the regions (ISW, 30 September 2022). Some analysts suggest that one of the goals of the annexation, which coincides with the recent announcement of the ""partial mobilization"" in Russia, is to allow the Kremlin to conscript Ukrainian civilians in the occupied territories (ISW, 26 September 2022). Much of the international community condemned the annexation and refused to recognize any potential changes to Ukrainian borders (Al Jazeera, 1 October 2022; Reuters, 30 September 2022)., In Russia, anti-mobilization protests continued last week following the announcement of the ""partial mobilization"" the week prior. The opposition Vesna movement and the Feminist Anti-War Resistance movement organized demonstrations in dozens of cities across the country. Ahead of the demonstrations, police attempted to prevent demonstrators from gathering in the city centers, dispersing people gathering in groups (RFE/RL, 24 September 2022). In Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Makhachkala, police tased demonstrators and journalists, and beat them with batons (TV Rain, 24 September 2022; OVD Info, 26 September 2022). Over 700 people were arrested during demonstrations on 24 September (RFE/RL, 24 September 2022), with several demonstrations also taking place on 25 and 26 September in Dagestan and Kabardino-Balkaria. Following the arrests, reports emerged of police engaging in the torture of detained activists (Caucasian Knot, 1 October 2022). This violence contributed to the 99% increase in weekly violent events in Russia in the past month relative to the weekly average for the preceding year. ACLED's Conflict Change Map also warned of increased violence in the country during the preceding four weeks., Meanwhile, 14 arson attacks against military enlistment offices and local administration centers were recorded throughout the country last week. Additionally, on 26 September, a reservist shot a military commissar at a military enlistment office in Ust-Ilimsk after his friend received a mobilization notice (RFE/RL, 26 September 2022)., Along the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, cross-border shelling and clashes continued last week. Three Armenian servicemen were killed and four Azerbaijani servicemen were wounded. Two Azerbaijani civilians were also killed as a result of a landmine explosion in the Fizuli region., The death of Mahsa Amini in Iran continued to spark demonstration activity across Europe last week for a second consecutive week. Rallies in support of the ongoing Iranian protests and women's rights in Iran were recorded in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In France and Greece, demonstrations outside Iranian embassies were dispersed by police with tear gas, while a Molotov cocktail was thrown against the Iranian embassy's outer wall in Athens on 25 September in a separate incident. In the United Kingdom, a similar rally turned violent after participants sought to enter the premises of the Iranian Embassy in London, leading to clashes with police and the arrest of 12 demonstrators., Meanwhile, 'pro-choice' supporters took to the streets across Europe to coincide with International Safe Abortion Day on 28 September. Protests were recorded in France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Spain, and the United Kingdom., Demonstration activity linked to rising living costs, inflation, and energy prices also continued across the region last week, with protests observed in Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Moldova, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In France, more than 110 demonstration events were recorded on 29 September in opposition to the government's controversial pension reform, which would provide for a progressive postponement of the retirement age up to 65 years in 2031 (Le Monde, 29 September 2022)., On 25 September, early general elections in Italy gave a clear lead to the right/far-right electoral alliance, including Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party, which went from garnering less than 2% of votes in 2013 to 26% last week. The result triggered several protests and school occupations across the country (New York Times, 26 September 2022; ANSA, 27 September 2022)., In Belgium, police forces carried out a series of raids against suspected far-right extremists across the country on 28 September, arresting six men on suspicion of preparing a 'terrorist' attack (Euronews, 28 September 2022).

This general population survey serves as a high-level source to identify areas with high humanitarian needs and to inform the targeting of response aiming to assist the war-affected population. The geographical scope of the assessment covers the entire territory of Ukraine, all five macro-regions (West, East, North, Centre, South, and the city of Kyiv), with the exception of the Crimean peninsula. The general population survey was constructed through a random‐digit‐dial (RDD) approach, and 2,002 unique and anonymous respondents aged 18 and over were interviewed using the computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) method. The estimates rely on the UNFPA population data for Ukraine, agreed upon as the common population baseline by the humanitarian community. Those currently outside Ukraine were not interviewed. In addition to this General Population Survey, data on recorded IDP presence at hromada level in Ukraine are available from IOM's Displacement Tracking Matrix -- Baseline Assessment (Round 12, 2022, HDX).",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-ukraine-internal-displacement-report-general-population-survey-round-9-26-september-2022

To date, 49 houses have been finished with repairs and 356 are ongoing with many more to be started., Over the week, nearly 80 protection monitoring missions to IDP sites in Dnipropetrovska, Donetska, Kharkivska, Poltavska, Sumska and Zaporizka oblasts were conducted. UNHCR local partners R2P and NGO Proliska assisted more than 1,180 people with specialized protection services such as legal consultations and psychosocial support sessions., UNHCR Assistant High Commissioners for Protection and Operations visited Ukraine to get a first-hand impression of the impact of the war on protection and humanitarian needs of people and strengthen the coordination with authorities as well as to re-emphasize and reaffirm UNHCR’s commitment to support and reinforce the resilience and determination of the people in Ukraine to recover and rebuild.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-emergency-unhcr-operational-response-delivery-updates-5-october-2022-enuk
Nationwide courses for trainers aimed to help foster parents shelter children are launched in Ukraine,News and Press Release,UNICEF,Protection and Human Rights,28 Sep 2022,"A new training course launched by UNICEF and partners aims to help foster care specialists find temporary homes for children., The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and partners have launched a new training course for foster care specialists, as many families prepare to shelter children left without parental care across the country., Forty-nine specialists, who were selected on a competitive basis, have been chosen to participate in the three-month programme., UNICEF launched the course together with the Partnership ‘For Every Child’, with the support of the Ministry of Social Policy and the National Social Service., ""We're glad that UNICEF and the partnership ‘For Every Child’, as well as many other specialists, are involved in developing and discussing the programme, “Children shouldn't be raised in institutional facilities. That's why it's crucial to prepare as many adults, who are ready to welcome them into their families, as possible.”, The course includes information on how to prepare for the reception of a child and how to deal with a child's psychological trauma. Classes will also explain to trainers the regulatory framework for the protection of children's rights. The training is based on the new programme for training candidates in family forms of upbringing, approved by the Ministry of Social Policy this month., ""Our working with trainers has always been a long process, like nine months or even a year,” says Vasylyna Dybailo, director of ‘For Every Child’. “Because it's similar to carrying and giving birth to a child and even more. But unfortunately, we have much less time during wartime, so we have to work faster. That's why we planned a more intensive working mode.”, “Our task is not just to gather and organize the groups,” adds Larisa Petushkova, course teacher and ‘For Every Child’ senior expert. “Our main goal is to help children be raised in families who can share their support, especially in these difficult times. We want children to feel safe and happy.”, Svitlana Tuntuyeva, a project manager from the international charity organization SOS Children's Villages Ukraine, is one of the course's students. She says she is enjoying the training and meeting with colleagues., “The learning process goes through several stages,” explains Svitlana. “First, we discussed training as a method of teaching adults in an online format, learned how to use online tools and analyzed the legislation on children's rights, focused on the changes caused by the war. The face-to-face format is aimed to practice particular topics and exercises.”, In December, the trained specialists will work with foster parents to develop and implement the knowledge in their local areas., Since the beginning of the full-scale war, the training of foster parents, caregivers, adoptive parents and foster carers has become especially important. According to the National Social Service, since February 24, more than 3,000 children have been left without parental care for various reasons., The training course has been launched within the framework of the UNICEF project ‘Monitoring and meeting the needs of children during martial law’, which is implemented by ‘For Every Child’, with the financial support of the Government of Japan, on the order of the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine and the National Social Service of Ukraine., Media contacts, Olha Pryshko, Communications Specialist, UNICEF in Ukraine, Email: opryshko@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/nationwide-courses-trainers-aimed-help-foster-parents-shelter-children-are-launched-ukraine
EU and IFC to provide €25 million in grants to help Ukrainian cities offer quality housing to internally displaced people,News and Press Release,EC,"Contributions
Protection and Human Rights",5 Oct 2022,"To boost the resilience of Ukraine's municipalities amid the ongoing war, IFC and the European Union (EU) are joining forces with the Lviv City Council to help the country renovate municipal buildings for internally displaced people (IDP), creating jobs and driving economic recovery. As part of IFC's broader response to impacts of the war, the aim is to help Ukraine provide quality temporary accommodation to people who had to flee the war-affected areas in eastern and southern Ukraine., Since February 24, one-third of Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes due to insecurity and damage to Ukraine's infrastructure. According to the Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment, prepared by Ukraine's Government, the European Commission, and the World Bank, the total damage to the housing sector as of June 1 is estimated at $39.2 billion. The recovery and reconstruction needs amount to $69 billion, with nearly $33 billion needed in the immediate term, especially to address the needs for winter., Under the agreement, IFC will channel up to €25 million of the EU funds in grants across municipalities, covering the costs of modernising accommodation for thousands of people. The project will pilot in Lviv, the largest city in western Ukraine, which has offered shelter to nearly 245,000 IDPs as of September 2022. The partnership aims to help ease the pressure on social cohesion, reducing the strain on public services., ""Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, we have welcomed thousands of people fleeing the war who have decided to stay temporarily in Lviv, and we are doing everything we can to make them feel as comfortable as possible. But there are many who need additional support. Today's partnership will help us address that challenge and increase both the quality and quantity of care we are able to provide,"" said Andriy Sadovyi, the Lviv City Mayor., In order to provide secure and convenient accommodation to displaced people, the partners agreed on a set of criteria that will apply to the selection of buildings, including quality connection to utilities and proximity to social infrastructure, such as public transport, schools, and medical facilities., ""We are aligning our efforts and deploying our resources to help renovate and refurbish buildings for IDPs in Lviv that our partners at IFC will help to implement,"" said Chloe Allio, Head of Section ""Economic cooperation, energy, infrastructure and environment"" at the EU Delegation in Ukraine., ""While IFC continues to support its existing private sector companies, this new partnership will provide direct support to Ukraine's people suffering from Russia's invasion,"" said Lisa Kaestner, IFC's Regional Manager for Ukraine and Moldova. ""We are grateful to our partners for their ongoing assistance and a generous financial package that will enable us to provide vital support to the Ukrainian people in these hard times."", CONTACT DETAILS, Kateryna Chechel

Norway to increase support for humanitarian efforts and government administration in Ukraine,News and Press Release,Govt. Norway,Contributions,5 Oct 2022,"‘The brutal war continues and Ukrainians are facing a cold winter. The scale of humanitarian need is enormous. We have proposed that NOK 2 billion of Norway’s support for Ukraine in 2022 should be used for humanitarian efforts and to help the Ukrainian government administration to maintain critical services,’ said Minister of Foreign Affairs Anniken Huitfeldt., In July, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre announced that the Government would provide an additional NOK 10 billion for Ukraine in the 2022–2023 period. In a proposition submitted to the Storting (Norwegian parliament) (only in Norwegian) today, the Government has proposed that NOK 4 billion of this amount is used for humanitarian aid in 2022:, The increase in aid to Ukraine in 2022 will not mean a reduction in aid to other countries and recipients this year. In addition, NOK 3 billion in military support is being provided under the 2022 Ministry of Defence budget., In total, Norwegian support for Ukraine in 2022 has been increased by NOK 7 billion. This comes in addition to the nearly NOK 4.5 billion that the Government has already provided to Ukraine in 2022 – of which roughly NOK 2.3 billion was allocated under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs budget and approximately NOK 2 billion under the Ministry of Defence budget. The Government will provide more detailed information about Norway’s support to Ukraine in 2023 in the 2023 national budget., ‘Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has created the worst crisis in Europe since the Second World War and is having a devastating effect on the Ukrainian people, Ukraine as a country and the Ukrainian economy. The invasion poses a threat to European security and is affecting Norway as well. Norway is doing its part to support the Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom, which is also a fight to safeguard our core values and interests such as security and democracy in Europe,’ said Ms Huitfeldt., More than seven million people have fled from Ukraine, and roughly the same number are internally displaced. In addition to the vast humanitarian needs, Ukraine is in need of support to maintain critical government services and infrastructure. There is also a need for support to ensure continued supplies of energy and gas for heating, food, medicines and other basic items., ‘Norway stands together with other countries and international organisations in the effort to support Ukraine. The funding Norway is providing will be channelled through established, internationally recognised organisations. Norway will seek effective, joint European and international solutions, also in connection with the reconstruction efforts to come. This is in our interests and will ensure that the funding is used where it is needed the most,’ said Ms Huitfeldt., Norway’s key partners for providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine are the UN, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, Norwegian and international humanitarian organisations, and the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. Norway works closely together with the UN, which cooperates with national and local authorities and with civil society organisations in Ukraine and in its neighbouring countries., The efforts will be targeted towards protection of civilians, including internally displaced persons and refugees. When winter sets in there will be a greater need for food, shelter and basic services. Areas to be given high priority include protection against sexual and gender-based violence, and clearing landmines and unexploded ordnance. Cash assistance to people in need is an important means of enabling people to preserve their dignity during this crisis., ‘Norway has already provided considerable humanitarian assistance to Ukraine and its neighbouring countries. This support, and the additional funding now proposed by the Government, are part of a large-scale international effort to provide people in need with the necessary protection, assistance and aid,’ said Ms Huitfeldt., The World Bank is playing a key role in supporting the Ukrainian government administration as it confronts an extremely difficult task. According to the World Bank, Ukraine’s GDP is expected to fall by 30–50 % in 2022. To coordinate and ensure effective financing of the Ukrainian government administration, the World Bank has set up the Ukraine Relief, Recovery and Reconstruction Trust Fund (URTF). The World Bank will use this fund to continue to mobilise crisis support to the Ukrainian authorities alongside new support for reconstruction. The Norwegian Government proposes to allocate an additional NOK 1 billion to this fund in 2022., ‘It is extremely challenging to run a country in times of war. Norway will provide budget support to the Ukrainian government administration so that it can deliver public services to its people, such as paying salaries for health care personnel, teachers and rescue teams, and for maintaining operational infrastructure,’ said Ms Huitfeldt., The Ukrainian authorities have asked Norway for support to procure natural gas this year. There is an acute shortage of electricity, and gas will facilitate the production of heat and alleviate the grave humanitarian situation in the coming winter. The Government therefore proposes providing NOK 2 billion in 2022 to help procure natural gas for Ukraine. The funding will be channelled through the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The EBRD is a well-established institution that Norway has an existing agreement with, and that can ensure effective and transparent use of the funding., Ukraine was known to have a history of corruption before the war started, and the risk of corruption grows when a country is at war. There is always a risk that Norwegian aid funding may be diverted for other purposes. It is therefore very important to ensure sound financial management. This can best be achieved by coordinating funding with other donors and channelling it through internationally recognised organisations that have systems in place for effective, verifiable use of support.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/norway-increase-support-humanitarian-efforts-and-government-administration-ukraine
"Near Ukraine's frontlines, food and friends ease icy months ahead",News and Press Release,WFP,Food and Nutrition,5 Oct 2022,"In the city of Sloviansk, residents count on WFP assistance and neighbourly bonds to cushion what may be the toughest winter of their lives., 5 October 2022, Edmond Khoury, Natalia and her neighbours do not jolt as the boom of shelling echoes continuously through her cosy living room. With the war in Ukraine now in its eighth month, they are used to it., They have decided to remain in the heart of Sloviansk, in the eastern Donetsk region—only a few kilometres from the frontlines., “Until peace is observed in the battlefield, I’ll keep finding it between the four walls of my home,” says Natalia, in her mid-50s., “This is our routine now,” she adds referring to the neighbours’ gathering. “All we have left here is each other.”, There are few other comforts these days — except World Food Programme (WFP) food for Ukrainians like themselves, who chose to remain near the frontlines., Targeting more than two million people living in areas affected by fighting and other disruptions, the monthly WFP rations include wheat flour, pasta, sunflower oil, canned meat and other essentials., The assistance is part of a flexible mix of food and cash that WFP uses to support vulnerable people — even as we face a US$690 million funding shortfall ahead of winter., Besides those staying put, the rations also support people returning home — often for lack of money and other resources to remain in safer places., “I have never relied on humanitarian assistance in my life,” Natalia says, “but the food I’m receiving is lifting a huge burden and shielding us from hunger.”, The rations are vital in places like Sloviansk, where fighting has upended commercial supply chains, preventing communities from reliably accessing nutritious foods., They will become all the more important as cold weather approaches, further straining the already precarious existence of many families here. Ukrainian winters are usually harsh, with temperatures dipping as low as -20 degrees Celsius., Always a way, For Natalia, who lives with her husband and mother-in-law—and who recently lost her job at a medical clinic that was her only source of income—the WFP rations are especially welcome., After the war started in late February, Natalia’s daughter and grandson left for Poland. They send her regular updates, but she rules out following them., “They are safe in Warsaw and that’s the only thing that matters right now. They keep insisting I join them, but I do not want to leave,” she says of her home in Sloviansk, where she has lived since 1967., “I spoke my first words, watched my family grow, and accumulated unforgettable memories,” she says, adding, “I was born here, and I will be staying until peace reigns.”, Besides, she says, “even if I were to leave, the rent to live elsewhere would be too expensive. Prices are rising, and I can’t keep up.” , The shrinking options make Natalia’s group of neighbours all the more important., “We have grown into one community. We always think about one another as we cook food, prepare our pantries for the winter, and get water from the well,” Natalia says, as she squeezes the hand of one of her friends., Still, the cold weather will usher in extra challenges. Even during peacetime, winters normally saw families like Natalia’s spending a larger portion of their limited incomes on heating, warm clothing and other non-food expenses. Today, rising food and fuel prices are putting some of these necessities beyond reach., But Natalia and her neighbours have figured out some fallbacks., “This year, we are mainly relying on electricity,” she says, “but if that’s not an option, we will be cutting trees and sharing wood to stay warm.”, The neighbours also plan to invite each other over and share key basics like food, “so that all of us stay warm and healthy during the winter,” she says. “There is always a way.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/near-ukraines-frontlines-food-and-friends-ease-icy-months-ahead
Young team comes together to support teens amid war [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Protection and Human Rights,5 Oct 2022,"Teenagers have found a place to seek help and advice, thanks to a UNICEF UPSHIFT project., Viktoriia Parfeniuk, Kate Bond, Life changed forever for Ukrainian families on 24 February 2022. Amid a devastating war, living conditions quickly deteriorated, with many parents and children forced to hide in bomb shelters for weeks. Millions of others had little choice but to flee to other cities, or even other countries., In the hope of helping teenagers cope, Oleksii Lytvynenko, 22, joined the UPSHIFT programme, a project supported by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) which works to empower young people., “The war exaggerated many problems that the teenagers faced,” says Oleksii. “It is issues such as about personal space, evacuation, loss of loved ones, and many others,” says Oleksii Lytvynenko, 22., As a member of the Teenage Island team, he created a safe virtual space using the Discord platform, which is popular among teenagers. Here, teenagers can communicate with their peers and receive professional psychological help., “This is a safe place where you can get away from unwanted reality,” says Oleksii. “At the moment, for us, that is the war.”, Oleksii and his team organise group consultations with a psychologist, in which they discuss issues and how to deal with them. Each participant can submit a request anonymously, and a specialist will comment on it., “Most often, they raise problems such as adaptation to new conditions, conflicts with classmates, as well as the loss of loved ones,” says Anna Buinova, a co-founder of the project. “Rape, suicide attempts and eating disorders are less common.”, The team also recorded a series of podcasts to help reach an even wider audience of teenagers. In it, a psychologist and a teenager – Sofia, 17 – discuss the various problems affecting Sofia’s peers., “I have many acquaintances, in particular teenagers, who like to listen to something when they do some mechanical work,” says Sofia. “That’s why a podcast is just what you need. It’s also useful.”, And that is not all – the team also organised creative writing classes and a ‘Dungeons and Dragons’ adventure, giving teenagers an outlet for their emotions. All of this takes place through a single online platform., “It’s great that the team chose Discord,” says Sofia. “It’s really cool because all my friends know this platform. They often spend time there.”, As well as giving teenagers a place to find help and advice during wartime, the team has also given them a way of making new friends., “I get incredible satisfaction from what I do,” says Anna. “Especially when I help the teenagers. They thank me, say that this is a really useful thing. Teenagers see the meaning in this activity.”, UPSHIFT Ukraine supports adolescents and youth, including the most disadvantaged and vulnerable, as agents of change. The project combines human-centred design workshops with mentorship to unleash the creative problem-solving skills of young leaders.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/young-team-comes-together-support-teens-amid-war-enuk
Europe and Central Asia Economic Update: Social Protection for Recovery (Fall 2022) [EN/RU/UK],Analysis,World Bank,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction",4 Oct 2022,"Russian Invasion of Ukraine Impedes Post-Pandemic Economic Recovery in Emerging Europe and Central Asia, WASHINGTON, October 4, 2022 – The ongoing war in Ukraine has dimmed prospects of a post-pandemic economic recovery for emerging and developing economies in the Europe and Central Asia region, says the World Bank’s Economic Update for the region, released today., Economic activity will remain deeply depressed through next year, with minimal growth of 0.3% expected in 2023, as energy price shocks continue to impact the region. So far, however, the region has weathered the storm of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine better than previously forecast. Regional output is now expected to contract by 0.2% this year, reflecting above expectation growth in some of the region’s largest economies and the prudent extension of pandemic-era stimulus programs by some governments., Ukraine’s economy is now projected to contract by 35% this year although economic activity is scarred by the destruction of productive capacity, damage to agricultural land, and reduced labor supply as more than 14 million people are estimated to have been displaced. According to recent World Bank estimates, recovery and reconstruction needs across social, productive, and infrastructure sectors total at least $349 billion, which is more than 1.5 times the size of Ukraine’s pre-war economy in 2021., ""Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered one of the biggest human displacement crises and exacted a heavy toll on human and economic life,” said Anna Bjerde, World Bank Vice President for the Europe and Central Asia region. “Ukraine continues to need enormous financial support as the war needlessly rages on as well as for recovery and reconstruction projects that could be quickly initiated."", The global economy continues to be weakened by the war through significant disruptions in trade and food and fuel price shocks, all of which are contributing to high inflation and subsequent tightening in global financing conditions. Activity in the euro area, the largest economic partner for emerging and developing economies (EMDEs) of Europe and Central Asia, has deteriorated markedly in the second half of 2022, due to distressed supply chains, increased financial strains and declines in consumer and business confidence. The most damaging effects of the invasion, however, are surging energy prices amid large reductions in Russian energy supply., Downgrades to growth forecasts for 2023 are broad-based across EMDEs in Europe and Central Asia as the regional outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty. Prolonged or intensified war could cause significantly larger economic and environmental damage and greater potential for fragmentation of international trade and investment. The risk of financial stress also remains elevated, given high debt levels and inflation., A supplement to the report examines the impact of the energy crisis. While global prices for oil, gas and coal have been rising since early 2021, they skyrocketed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, sending inflation to levels not seen for decades in the region. This unprecedented crisis has implications for consumers and Governments alike – constraining fiscal affordability; firm productivity; and household welfare., Hardest hit will be countries with medium to high reliance on natural gas imports for heating (which accounts for 30% of energy demand), industry, or electricity, as well as countries closely connected with EU energy markets. These countries must prepare for gas shortages and put in place emergency plans to mitigate the worst impacts on households and firms, including saving energy, boosting energy efficiency, and implementing quota/rationing plans. Behavior change campaigns that focus on heating efficiency in homes and buildings, such as resealing windows and adding insulation, require relatively minimal investment and have immediate impacts., ""The overlapping crises of the war in Ukraine, the ongoing pandemic and the surge in food and fuel prices are painful reminders that governments need to be prepared to manage massive, unexpected shocks that unravel very quickly,” said Ms. Bjerde. “Social protection systems, which are the bedrock of anti-poverty efforts, need to be modernized to make them effective in the face of shocks as well as longer-term challenges."", The report also includes a special focus on the region’s social protection systems, which have played a critical role in supporting households and businesses during the pandemic and, more recently, from the fallout of the war in Ukraine., The region’s pandemic response comprised two broad types of policy instruments: income protection measures and job protection measures. The report assesses the effectiveness of these measures in promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, and preserving jobs. It finds that, in the short run, higher spending on job protection measures was associated with higher employment and less poverty. However, the effect of these measures on growth is less clear., These lessons from the pandemic are instructive for policymakers in making social protections systems adaptive and inclusive to effectively address both short-term shocks to the economy, and the longer term trends which are transforming labor markets, including globalization, demographic trends, technological innovation, and the impacts of climate change and climate action., Policy interventions to building social protection systems for the future can include a combination of (i) guaranteed minimum income support designed to protect individuals and households from adverse shocks, (ii) regulatory reforms that gradually remove restrictions on firms’ hiring and dismissal practices, and ultimately support the creation of formal jobs in the private sector and a reduction in informality; (iii) enhanced coverage of and protection for vulnerable groups; and (iv) digitalization for improved quality and quantity of services provision., PRESS RELEASE NO: 2023/ECA/18, Contacts, Washington

FCA leads school return project in Ukraine with €14 million EU funding,News and Press Release,FCA,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",4 Oct 2022,"FCA’s educational work in Ukraine is progressing – schools are being renovated and teachers supported with EU co-financing of €14 million., 14 million euros of EU funding will help children return to school in Ukraine through a new project led by FCA., The education project sees FCA receive €5.5 million from EU Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid (ECHO), while project partners Save the Children and People In Need will each receive €4.2 million. In addition, War Child Holland will benefit from an approximately €50,000 share., “This 14 million euro funding is very important and shows the commitment of the EU to help the Ukrainian school system to get back on its feet. Sadly, it is just a first step, the needs are so large that more funding will need to be pledged in the future for every child to be able to go back to school,” says Yannic Georis, FCA’s emergency response manager in Ukraine., School rehabilitation and well-being in focus, During the next 14 months, FCA and its partners aim to reach approximately 67,000 children, focusing on rehabilitating schools, organising temporary learning spaces and digital learning centers, psychosocial support and fostering the well-being of teachers., “There is a lot of positive defiance and willpower throughout the education system, everyone wants to be back in a working mode. Children and teachers have a right and a need to return,” Peter Hyll-Larsen, FCA’s education expert in Ukraine, describes the situation in the country., Hyll-Larsen highlights, however, that infrastructural damage cannot be repaired as fast as everyone would like. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Education and Science, a total of 286 schools have been destroyed during the war by mid-September. In addition, 2,477 schools have been damaged in bombing and fighting., “As some areas in the East become liberated, it is also evident that the initial efforts on mental health, psychosocial support and child protection through education remain crucial – and will remain so for months and years to come,” Hyll-Larsen says., Schoolwork continues in an unsure situation, The new school year started in September – partly remotely and partly on-site. A condition for returning to school is that the building has functioning shelters. According to expert estimates, 59 per cent of Ukrainian schools meet this condition., The coming school year can be challenging in many ways in many parts of the country. Due to the war and the energy crisis, schools are already preparing for the possibility that students will have to be sent home due to lack of heating., Experts now stress that distance learning models, skills and equipment will be needed in the coming winter too. Hyll-Larsen says that the situation is at its worst in liberated areas in the East., “These areas will face a particularly harsh winter due to very little electricity and hence also very few online learning opportunities.”, FCA equips bomb shelters and trains teachers together with a local partner, Even before receiving ECHO funding, Finn Church Aid had been working diligently to help Ukrainians since the beginning of the war., This started with emergency aid for Ukrainians fleeing violence within and out of the country. Over the summer, FCA expanded its operations to Northern Ukraine, training local teachers and school psychologists in psychosocial skills. Together with the local partner organisation DOCCU, FCA organised summer clubs for children in the area, where children and young people could spend time together in a safe environment., During the summer clubs, more than 20 air raid alarms were heard in the area for 30 days, during which children and young people spent hours in poorly equipped bomb shelters., As fighting continues, FCA will continue to work with DOCCU, equipping the bomb shelters of Chernihiv schools into better learning environments. Teachers will be trained in specialised subjects, like organising lessons in war conditions, increasing interaction during distance education and how to act during air alarms., FCA’s Ukraine office gets a new country director, In August, FCA completed the official Ukrainian registration process. As a result, Finn Church Aid now has a functioning country office in Ukraine. Patricia Maruschak will start as director of the new country office in October., “The opportunity to work in Ukraine is really exciting to me. I have Ukrainian-Canadian background. When the invasion began, it was very upsetting. It still is very upsetting, but I feel a lot of pride in the way Ukrainians are responding,” says Maruschak., “I think the focus on education in emergencies is so important and so needed. Good education is important to people in Ukraine, and that all has been disrupted now. I think the fact that FCA is capable of assisting the government of Ukraine, the people of Ukraine to get their education system running in such a way that works for them under these circumstances, I think it’s incredible valuable.”, FCA will stay in Ukraine, supporting teachers and actively seeking ways to make the school return possible for children. The new country director starts in her position in October., Text: Ulriikka Myöhänen",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/fca-leads-school-return-project-ukraine-eu14-million-eu-funding

Water Sanitation Hygiene",4 Oct 2022,"As the war continues, HelpAge International’s country director in Ukraine Akbar Nazriev shares his insights on how things have changed and what life is like living under the ongoing threat of attack., For people in eastern Ukraine, life was hard before February, having endured eight years of hostilities with Russia., The local economy was broken and young people had left to find work, leaving older people to fend for themselves., One in three people affected by the conflict was over-60. From Sloviansk, HelpAge International supported older people within five km from the contact line, which separated people living in government and non-government-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine. Through the support of 250 local volunteers, we provided food, healthcare and psychosocial support to older people living alone in an area where the risk of shelling and the outbreak of hostilities loomed., The longer range of the missiles now means large-scale humanitarian assistance can only safely reach those living 40 km away from the contact line. It is only because of our smaller response, relationships with communities and our network of local volunteers that we can still get to within five kms, so long as extra safety protocols are followed., Safety is the biggest priority, balanced with the urgency to provide assistance. Every time I give permission for staff to travel to different areas, there is a weight of responsibility to ensure they return home safely., Before, we had a rule that if any shelling was heard, all staff returned to the office immediately. Now, with it happening so much more, judgements are made on different criteria. When two security colleagues travelled further east, they called to tell me they could hear shelling but that it was safe because it was far away. Even so, every hour I was sending messages to check they were OK, going through maps, tracking where they were, finding it hard to concentrate on anything else., In Dnipro, shelling has become more frequent. We hear explosions and our windows shake as the Ukraine air defence system captures missiles over the city. The other Saturday, the critical civil infrastructure in Dnipro was targeted, one km away from where I was staying. There was a huge blast and everything shook., There is a risk either way, whether you are on the frontline, or in a major city further away. One friend said she had felt safer in Kabul and in one sense of course she did: they didn’t have missiles there., But you get used to it. There is a normalisation with shelling, air raid warnings and going to shelters late in the night., The determined Ukrainian spirit continues, and more areas are being altered by the international influences that the humanitarian workers bring from around the world. This was evident in cities like Sloviansk, Mariupol and Severodonetsk before, but has become more widespread., My recent visit to Kryvyi Rih, south-west of Dnipro reminded me again of this., There was shelling nearby and the contact line is only 50 km away. Yet the local population comes and goes, leading a normal life. They are working, walking, drinking coffee, chatting, living alongside humanitarian workers - even becoming part of the humanitarian response themselves., One local man I met set up an NGO a few months ago and bought a building from a kindergarten. Every room has different activities to support all ages including older people, like pottery classes, dancing and music. With so many other people leaving, he has managed to buy another four-storey building relatively cheaply to shelter displaced people and help distribute humanitarian items., Another NGO rents a three-story building that used to be a hotel and now has 180 beds for displaced people. Before the war the organisation helped people with drug or alcohol addiction. When the war started the staff told them they could either work as part of the team or leave. Everyone stayed and provided support, while continuing with their recovery., One older woman I met there told me she had lived alone in her basement in Avdiivka, a main city in Donetsk Oblast before. She now sees a nurse, has company and eats three meals a day. In the kitchen, three older people were chatting while scrubbing potatoes to help make lunch for everyone. There were about 60 people staying when I visited, but there is capacity for 180. There is also a basement that can be used as a shelter and contains two weeks of food supplies and water, as well as an electric generator., You can see the badness but also the goodness of people in times of war. It’s an honour to be able to directly help people affected, but it helps to remember that the bad also makes good things happen, even in the hardest of times., By Akbar Nazriev, Country Director, HelpAge International in Ukraine",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/adapting-life-country-war
IOM Delivers Critical Aid to Newly Accessible Areas in Ukraine [EN/UK],News and Press Release,IOM,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",4 Oct 2022,"Kyiv – Communities cut off from humanitarian aid are receiving life-saving assistance from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) for the first time since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine., In coordination with other humanitarian organizations, from 16 to 29 September, IOM delivered over 30,000 relief items in 23 trucks to five municipalities in Kharkiv region: Shevchenkove, Balakliia, Chuhuiv, Velykyi Burluk, and Izum. The assistance included solar lamps, bed linen, mattresses, blankets, family hygiene kits, as well as tarpaulin and kits with tools to help residents prepare their damaged homes for winter., There are nearly 400,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the region of Kharkiv. Thousands of people remain without water, electricity or heating as the existing systems were damaged by recent fighting., “Our emergency teams were among the first to reach these areas that have seen incredibly heavy fighting in recent weeks,” said Anh Nguyen, Chief of Mission, IOM Ukraine. “People there are in dire need of all kinds of humanitarian assistance, particularly to make their homes habitable for the harsh winter they are facing. We intend to scale up our response and ensure that no one is left behind.”, According to IOM’s latest data, out of over 6 million internally displaced persons in Ukraine, 82 per cent were forced to leave their homes in the east and south of the country. A total of 15 per cent of IDPs report that their housing is not adequate for winter, with as much as 23 per cent facing this challenge in the east., In Kherson region, IOM delivered 1,200 emergency shelter kits for war-affected populations. The assistance was delivered to local authorities for further distribution in the municipalities of Vysokopillia and Mala Shesternia days after these areas became accessible., ‘’Working with IOM, we’ve been able to deliver shelter kits that can each repair 60 square metres of damaged homes,” said Yaroslav Yanushevich, Head of the Kherson Military Administration. “This is essential given the worsening weather conditions during the cold season.”, Emergency shelter repair kits include plywood, tarpaulin, wooden battens, roofing material, ropes, hammers, nails and other items., “Every residential building here has been damaged, including damage to windows, walls or roofs,” says Andrii, who lives in the town of Novovorontsovka, Kherson Region, a locality scarred by recent heavy fighting. “There is ongoing fighting next to residential areas, but there are still civilians living here who are not able to leave and are in desperate need.”, This assistance was delivered thanks to funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and the European Union., For more information, please contact:, Varvara Zhluktenko, vzhluktenko@iom.int, +380 67 447 97 92, Jorge Galindo, jgalindo@iom.int, +380 93 631 92 60, Joe Lowry, jlowry@iom.int, +43 1 581 22 22",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-delivers-critical-aid-newly-accessible-areas-ukraine-enuk
Ukraine: Three Men’s Bodies Found in Forest [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,4 Oct 2022,"Four Months After Men Were Detained, Tortured by Russia-Linked Forces, (Kyiv, October 4, 2022) – Russian-affiliated forces unlawfully detained and apparently killed at least three civilian men, then dumped their bodies in a forest, during Russia’s partial occupation of Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, Human Rights Watch said today. This is one among many cases involving alleged war crimes that Human Rights Watch is investigating in the region., The men, Ivan Shebelnik, 52; Oleksii Taran, 76; and Yurii Kavun, about 59, were detained in late March 2022 and held in a cellar in Kapytolivka, a village near Izium, which a fourth man who had also been detained but survived described to Human Rights Watch. The bodies were found in a forest in early August. Medical and police reports indicate that one suffered from chest trauma with multiple broken ribs, the second died from blunt trauma to the head, and the third had a head wound., “These brutal killings provide a window into the abuses that residents who lived under Russian occupation for six months witnessed and experienced,” said Belkis Wille, senior crisis and conflict researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Ukrainian authorities, with support from partners, should work to preserve all evidence of these killings and others like them – including any indications of the specific forces and commanders who may have been responsible – to help ensure that those responsible are held to account and justice is ultimately delivered.”, Human Rights Watch interviewed nine residents of Kapytolivka, about five kilometers southeast of Izium. The residents said that Russian and Russian-affiliated forces began occupying the village in late February or early March and left around September 9, in response to the Ukrainian counter-offensive. During at least the first month of occupation, residents said, most of the occupying forces were from the “Luhansk People’s Republic,” an area of Ukraine’s Luhanska region controlled by Russian-affiliated armed groups and currently occupied by Russia (also known as LNR, which is used as a reference to this area, not as recognition of any sovereignty claims). Residents determined this based on the forces’ accents., Seven people interviewed said they knew the victims or the circumstances of their detention. Two immediate relatives of Shebelnik, a metal factory worker, said that his in-laws came to visit in late March. They said that Shebelnik and his father-in-law, Taran, left home on the morning of March 23 to collect pinecones to use as kindling but never returned., Multiple relatives tried to find them, contacting the soldiers based in the area, lodging missing persons complaints with the local police force established by the occupying forces, and visiting School No. 2 in neighboring Izium, which they had heard was being used as a detention center. Two residents of Kapytolivka said there was a Russian intelligence base in the area where Taran and Shebelnik’s relatives said they had gone to collect the pinecones., In early August, members from the occupying police force contacted the Shebelniks, saying that after a farmer had come across the smell of decaying bodies in the forest, the authorities had recovered three bodies and brought them to Izium Central Hospital for forensic examinations. At the hospital, Shebelnik’s cousin identified the bodies of Shebelnik and Taran based on their clothing. She and another relative saw the death certificates for both men, issued on August 11 by a hospital pathologist., Shebelnik’s certificate, which Human Rights Watch researchers reviewed, states that he died from chest trauma with multiple broken ribs. Taran’s states that he died from blunt trauma to the head, the relatives said. The local police told the family the third man they found was identified as another village resident, Yurii Kavun, who had died from a head wound., On September 28, researchers interviewed another village resident, who was detained with the three victims and requested anonymity. He said that four men whom he believed were LNR soldiers detained him on March 24, as they were searching homes on his street and suspected he was hiding a generator on his property, which they wanted to confiscate. He said they took him to a cellar in one of four adjacent houses that the forces were occupying. He estimated it was 2.5 by 2.5 meters, with a low ceiling. It contained two mattresses that he suspected the owners had used to shelter before they fled., He said that two other men were already being held there. It was dark but he soon recognized Shebelnik’s voice. They had worked together at a nearby factory. He said the other man was very old, and spoke very little, but eventually he found out that he was Taran., Shebelnik told him that LNR forces stopped them as they were returning home, strip searched them, and brought them there. The detainee said he did not see the LNR forces abuse Taran, but they took Shebelnik upstairs several times: “When he was brought back, he never wanted to talk about what they did to him, but I heard screams each time.”, Two days into his detention, he said, the forces brought in Yurii Kavun, who lived near him. He and Kavun’s neighbors said forces had arrested Kavun because he used to be in the military, though he had retired several years earlier with a herniated disc. One of Kavun’s neighbors said they arrested him, released him, then re-arrested him in late March. The neighbor was home both times., The former detainee said that Kavun’s face was covered in blood: “He told us a solider shot his gun and the bullet hit something next to Yurii’s face, and lots of metal fragments went into his face. We had one blanket, and we tried to bandage him.” The former detainee said the soldiers finally cleaned and bandaged his face, but then beat him at least three or four times over the next few days. The former detainee was then released., The former detainee said that two or three other detainees were brought to the cellar while he was there, but only for a day or two, and he didn’t know them since they came from Izium., On September 28, researchers visited a cellar in the garden behind a home that neighbors said the LNR forces occupied from March to April, which fully matched the description by the former detainee and still contained the mattresses. The neighbors said LNR forces occupied three more houses next to that one., A man living directly opposite said that on at least one occasion he had heard screams coming from one of the houses. Researchers observed what might have been a blood splatter on the cellar floor. The remains of a burned military vehicle were still in the front yard. Neighbors said the houses had been damaged in attacks in late April, causing the pro-Russian forces to pull back to another base in the area., These were most likely not the only civilian killings during the occupation, with some bodies buried in a burial site on the outskirts of Izium during the 6-month occupation showing possible signs of torture and executions., Human Rights Watch documented that Russian forces arbitrarily detained, tortured, and extrajudicially executed people in other regions they occupied., All parties to the armed conflict in Ukraine are obligated to abide by international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, including the Geneva Conventions of 1949, the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, and customary international law. Belligerent armed forces that have effective control of an area are subject to the international law of occupation, in particular as set out in the Fourth Geneva Convention. International human rights law, including prohibitions on inhuman and degrading treatment and torture, the right to life, and the prohibition on arbitrary detention, is also applicable at all times., The laws of war prohibit willful killing, torture, and inhumane treatment of captured combatants and civilians in custody. Anyone who orders or deliberately commits such acts, or aids and abets them, is responsible for war crimes. Commanders of forces who knew or had reason to know about such crimes but did not attempt to stop them or punish those responsible are criminally liable for war crimes as a matter of command responsibility., Russia and Ukraine have obligations under the Geneva Conventions to investigate alleged war crimes committed by their forces or on their territory and appropriately prosecute those responsible. Victims of abuses and their families should receive prompt and adequate redress., “These killings in the Izium area add to a long litany of alleged war crimes by Russian forces in Ukraine,” Wille said. “As more information on crimes continues to emerge, preserving this evidence with an eye toward successful prosecutions is more important than ever.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-three-mens-bodies-found-forest-enruuk

Violence affects women and girls everywhere: UK statement to the OSCE,News and Press Release,Govt. UK,Protection and Human Rights,3 Oct 2022,"At OSCE’s Human Dimension Conference, Eily Craig voices UK's deep concern about rising reports of gender-based violence in Putin's illegal war in Ukraine., Thank you, Mr Convenor., Global estimates show that 1 in 3 women will experience physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetimes. Violence affects women and girls everywhere., Gender equality and fighting all forms of violence against women and girls are crucial to the OSCE's comprehensive concept of security and stability and the UK commends the work of the OSCE executive structures in implementing the Women, Peace and Security agenda., I'd like to highlight the utility and value of two OSCE sponsored toolkits. Firstly, the toolkit for ""Inclusion of Women and Effective Peace Processes"", a valuable resource for conflict mediation in all OSCE conflicts. And, secondly, the Gender and Security toolkit, which provides practical policy and programmatic guidance for governments, for regional and international organisations and for justice institutions., I'd like to thank all those who have contributed to advancing gender equality and the Women, Peace and Security agenda at the OSCE., We know that violence against women and girls further escalates in scale and severity in conflict and crisis, and this has been seen in the detrimental impact that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has had on women and girls., We welcomed the publication of the OSCE's Moscow Mechanism reports, which help expose the truth of Putin's illegal war in Ukraine. We remain deeply concerned about rising reports of gender-based violence, including horrific acts of sexual violence, with most cases committed in areas controlled by Russian armed forces., In April, the UK launched the Murad Code, a code of conduct for documenting the experiences of survivors of conflict-related sexual violence in a way that upholds survivors' rights. We are now urging governments, national authorities, international organisations and civil society to commit to taking a survivor-centred approach to such documentation - in line with the standards set out in the Code., In November the UK are hosting an ambitious international conference that marks 10 years since the launch of the Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict Initiative. We will use this to strengthen global action and deliver real change for survivors., Mr Convenor, we know that violence against women and children is preventable. The UK remains steadfast in its commitment to working toward a future for women and children that is free from discrimination and violence., Rigorous evaluations have shown that harmful attitudes and norms can change in less than three years -- this does not have to take generations., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/violence-affects-women-and-girls-everywhere-uk-statement-osce
Left behind: How war is affecting older people and people with disabilities in Ukraine,News and Press Release,PIN,Protection and Human Rights,1 Oct 2022,"Eastern areas of Ukraine have faced an alarming humanitarian situation since 2014. Even before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, many older people and persons with disabilities experienced challenges getting to safety and accessing humanitarian aid. These vulnerable people have limited physical and financial capacities to enable them to leave insecure areas for safer places., According to OCHA report estimations, 13 percent of people needing humanitarian assistance in Ukraine have a disability. And now, with the escalation of the fighting, air attacks, and Russian troops in the country, older people and persons with disabilities are at high risk of losing their lives, having difficulty accessing safe evacuation, and lacking dignified shelter and access to humanitarian assistance., When fighting occurs, most people rush to move to safe areas ensuring security for themselves, their families, and loved ones. But for many older people and those with disabilities, this is either impractical or highly complicated., Unfortunately, evacuation plans proposed by authorities are often not designed in ways that accommodate these groups. Persons with disabilities often cannot reach train stations and shelters, which are frequently inaccessible for persons with limited mobility. Consequently, many older people and people with disabilities do not understand how to access transportation and assistance., People in Need delivers assistance to older people and people with disabilities in different regions in Ukraine. In Pavlohrad, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, we support the local neuropsychological hospital, which moved from Barvinkove, Kharkiv Oblast, due to the security situation and the active fighting in the area. The hospital settled in a building provided by local authorities in Pavlohrad., “Today, the building of the neuropsychological hospital in Barvinkove sustained damage and is partially destroyed. We moved just before it was shelled. We evacuated 87 people with disabilities who were staying in the hospital and 50 of our staff members who are now taking care of the patients here in Pavlohrad,” says Mikhailo, Head of the hospital., The hospital staff are doing their best to care for their patients in the new location. It was challenging to evacuate everyone and settle in the new site. The hospital staff are trying to create conditions similar to those they had in Barvinkove, but in the current circumstances, it is barely manageable., “I like it here; it is nice. But I want to go back to our lovely Barvinkove. We were hiding in the basement there; it was terrifying. But I hope the war ends and I’ll be able to come back,” shares Viktoria, a hospital patient., Alyona Budagovska, PIN Ukraine Advocacy and Communications manager",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/left-behind-how-war-affecting-older-people-and-people-disabilities-ukraine

Ukraine: Missile attack on humanitarian convoy in Zaporizhzhia further proof of Russia’s ‘utter disregard for civilian lives’,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,30 Sep 2022,"Responding to reports that at least 25 civilians were killed today by a missile strike on a humanitarian convoy in the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, Denis Krivosheev, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said:, “The fact that a humanitarian convoy was struck in this horrendous attack is further proof of Russia’s utter disregard for civilian lives in Ukraine. People delivering humanitarian aid are not military targets, and it is devastating to see more lives ruined by wanton death and destruction. All those responsible for Russia’s repeated unlawful attacks in Ukraine must be held accountable for their actions.”, The convoy was struck as it was preparing to go a Russian-occupied part of the region to deliver humanitarian aid. Intentionally directing attacks against personnel, installations, material, units or vehicles involved in a humanitarian assistance mission is a war crime., By analysing photos and video from social media, Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab confirmed that the strike hit the line of civilian vehicles as it gathered at the Avtorynok car scrapyard market on the southern outskirts of Zaporizhzhia, approximately 27.5 kilometres from the front line. A crater near the convoy measured approximately five meters wide and 2.5 metres deep, which is consistent with the warhead of a large guided missile., According to media reports, at least 25 people were killed and 50 wounded – all of them civilians. Amnesty International was able to confirm 23 individual deaths of women and men by analysing photos and videos to identify unique clothing and distinctive features on the victims’ bodies., Ukrainian authorities reported that 16 missiles were fired at or near Zaporizhzhia during the attack, and online records indicate that the alarm sirens of the civil defence warning system sounded at 7.11am local time, nearly simultaneously with the strike. Based on the distance inside Ukrainian controlled territory, the warning sirens, the size and type of crater, and the number of weapons simultaneously fired, Amnesty International believes this was almost certainly an attack by Russian military forces., The strike comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin today announced the annexation of four Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian forces in the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions. Amnesty International has previously declared the so-called referenda that preceded the announcement illegal, and their results a “sham”, and warned that Russia’s annexation of occupied territory would violate international law., Accountability for war crimes, Since the beginning of the conflict, Amnesty International has been documenting Russian war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law committed during Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine. All of Amnesty International’s outputs published to date – including news updates, reports, briefings and investigations – can be found here., Amnesty International has called repeatedly for members of Russian forces and officials responsible for violations to be held to account, and has welcomed the ongoing International Criminal Court investigation in Ukraine. Comprehensive accountability in Ukraine will require the concerted efforts of the UN and its organs, as well as initiatives at the national level pursuant to the principle of universal jurisdiction.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-missile-attack-humanitarian-convoy-zaporizhzhia-further-proof-russias-utter-disregard-civilian-lives
Research Terms of Reference - REACH | CCCM – IDP Collective Sites Monitoring Research cycle – UKR2207 Ukraine,Manual and Guideline,REACH,Protection and Human Rights,3 Oct 2022,"2 . Rationale 　　, 2 .1 Background The sudden escalation of conflict that started in Ukraine on the 24th of February 2022 has led to an unprecedented level of need among conflict-affected populations, leading to millions being displaced across and within Ukraine’s borders. As of 16th of March, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates almost 6.5 million3 IDPs within Ukraine. Due to the ongoing and evolving military operations targeting the north, south and east of Ukraine, more people are expected to be displaced in the near future. 　　, In this highly challenging and dynamic context, gaps emerge in the capacity of government providers, humanitarian actors, and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to maintain a complete picture of IDP needs, movements and location. The West of Ukraine is the region that received the most IDPs since the start of the escalation. As such, the information gaps on collective sites in the region in the region are particularly acute. The constant displacement of families and fluidity of IDP movements has been a significant challenge in acquiring timely and accurate data on the numbers, locations and need of IDPs across Ukraine, limiting the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance planning and implementation. 　　, 2 .2 Intended impact, In order to address these gaps, REACH, through the CCCM cluster and in partnership with UNHCR, will be providing humanitarian actors with the required information to meet the basic needs of IDPs in Ukraine in a timely and effective manner. Through its IDP collective site monitoring project, REACH will inform the CCCM cluster of ongoing displacement through regular updates, specifically on the situation in the collective sites regarding: the number and profiles of IDPs staying in collective sites, their type and capacity of, movement intentions, priority needs of IDPs, as well as access to services., Further, REACH will support the harmonization of data collection methodologies for displacement monitoring to collective sites in Ukraine.

Update 110 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (1 Oct 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,1 Oct 2022,"After receiving information about the detention of Ihor Murashov, Director General of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been in contact with the relevant authorities and has been informed that Mr Murashov is in temporary detention, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today., The IAEA, in line with its nuclear safety and security mandate, has been actively seeking clarifications and hopes for a prompt and satisfactory resolution of this matter, Director General Grossi said. He reiterated that this detention has a very significant impact on at least two of the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that he outlined at the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine., “Such a detention of any member of the plant staff would be a source of grave concern in itself, but also for its psychological impact and pressure on the rest of the staff - which is detrimental to nuclear safety and security”, said Director General Grossi., Furthermore, the Director General of the ZNPP has the responsibility to ensure the nuclear safety and security of the plant. He ensures that all the plant’s operational procedures are implemented, including the ones related to nuclear safety, radiation safety of operating personnel, and to nuclear security. Additionally, he activates and leads the response to any on-site nuclear emergency., “His absence from duty in this way also has an immediate and serious impact on decision-making in ensuring the safety and security of the plant,” Director General Grossi added., Director General Grossi expressed the hope that Mr Murashov will return to his family safely and promptly and will be able to resume his important functions at the plant., Separately today, IAEA experts present at the ZNPP reported that several explosions were again heard in the vicinity of the plant. As with the previous explosions reported by the IAEA this week, they are believed to have been caused by landmines. The explosions did not result in any direct impact on the safety or security systems of the ZNPP., Today’s explosions indicate a continued rise in the number of landmine explosions reported this week outside the perimeter fence of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which is controlled by Russian forces but operated by its Ukrainian staff. Director General Grossi remains deeply concerned about the repeated occurrence of such landmine explosions near the plant., Director General Grossi continues his consultations and other efforts aimed at agreeing and implementing a nuclear safety and security zone around the ZNPP as soon as possible. He is expected to travel to Kyiv and Moscow next week.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-110-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-1-oct-2022
World Bank Mobilizes Additional $530 Million in Support to Ukraine [EN/UK],News and Press Release,World Bank,"Education
Health
Protection and Human Rights",30 Sep 2022,"Total World Bank-Mobilized Support Now Stands at $13 Billion, WASHINGTON, September 30, 2022 —The World Bank today announced an additional $530 million to help the Government of Ukraine meet urgent needs created by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The IBRD financing is supported by timely loan guarantees by the United Kingdom ($500 million) and the Kingdom of Denmark ($30 million) and was mobilized under the Public Expenditures for Administrative Capacity Endurance in Ukraine (PEACE) Project, which supports continued government capacity, including the provision of core public services such as health, education, and social protection., “The toll of destruction, damage, and dislocation in Ukraine is staggering and continues to grow,” said Anna Bjerde, World Bank Regional Vice President for Europe and Central Asia. “The support of the international community so far has been impressive, and we are so grateful to the people of United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Denmark for their continued assistance. The Ukrainian people have a long road to recovery ahead and development partners will need to continue to pull together to support Ukraine’s reconstruction.”, To date, the World Bank has mobilized nearly $13 billion in emergency financing for Ukraine, including commitments and pledges from donors, of which $11 billion has been fully disbursed. The assistance has allowed Ukraine to continue providing essential government services to the population and helped ease the impacts of the widespread human and economic losses caused by the war., “Our most recent analysis shows that the total long-term cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine are enormous, with the needs even for the next three years totaling well over $100 billion, a figure that is expected to grow as the war continues,” said Arup Banerji, World Bank Regional Country Director for Eastern Europe. “But the Government of Ukraine is focusing on immediate social needs, and ensuring that urgent recovery and repairs are completed, while preparing for the enormous tasks around reconstruction. We welcome the continuous generosity and commitment of international partners in ensuring that the people of Ukraine can both survive this crisis and prosper in the future.”, Quotes from Donor Governments, **James Cleverly, **Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, “UK guarantee financing will unlock further urgent financial support that is needed to help sustain Ukraine’s economic resilience and their courageous resistance against Russia’s brutal invasion.”, Flemming Møller Mortensen, Minister for Development Cooperation of the Kingdom of Denmark, “Denmark is proud of our commitment to support Ukraine through the World Bank. Today is an important day, as the loan to Ukraine sustains core functions and helps cover social payment to support pensioners, schoolteachers and health workers in Ukraine. The EUR 40 million guarantee follows a Danish grant of EUR 20 million through the World Bank for the same purpose. This brings Denmark’s total of military and civilian – including humanitarian and financial support -- to more than EUR 563 million since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February this year. It proves our close partnership with the World Bank and Ukraine.”, PRESS RELEASE NO: 2023/ECA/16, Contacts, Washington, D.C.

"Security Council Fails to Adopt Resolution Condemning Moscow's Referenda in Ukraine’s Occupied Territories, as Permanent Member Employs Veto",News and Press Release,UN SC,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,30 Sep 2022,"SC/15046, MEETINGS COVERAGE
SECURITY COUNCIL, 9143RD MEETING (PM), Representative Calls 15-Member Organ ‘Broken Pillar’ of United Nations, Meeting today following Russian Federation President Vladimir V. Putin’s proclamation of Moscow’s annexation of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, the Security Council rejected a draft resolution intended to condemn the referenda that preceded it., The draft, submitted by Albania and the United States, garnered support from 10 members but was vetoed by the Russian Federation. Brazil, China, Gabon and India all abstained., Through the draft resolution, the 15-member Council would have also declared that the referenda taken on 23 to 27 September in parts of those regions are neither valid nor form the basis for any alteration of the status of these regions of Ukraine, including any purported annexation by the Russian Federation., The draft would also have the Council call on all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize any alteration of the status of these Ukrainian regions, nor any purported acquisition thereof by the Russian Federation., By other terms, the Council would have decided that the Russian Federation shall desist and refrain from actions aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine in all areas within that country’s internationally recognized borders., Further, the organ would have decided that the Russian Federation shall immediately cease its full-scale, unlawful invasion of Ukraine and immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders to enable a peaceful resolution of the conflict., Speaking before the vote, the representative of the United States recalled that some people have said that the process leading to this draft resolution was rushed, but stressed that “what was rushed was Russia’s illegal act to annex Ukraine’s territory”. Underscoring that this issue is about collective security, she urged other Council members to vote in favour of the resolution in defence of international peace and security., The representative of the Russian Federation, however, said that the Council has never adopted resolutions that directly condemn one of its members, adding that other Council members are pushing his delegation to use its veto so they can wax lyrical that the Russian Federation is abusing that right. “The results of the [referenda] speak for themselves — the residents of these regions do not want to return to Ukraine,” he said, emphasizing that the referenda were carried out in full conformity with international law., Following the vote, Albania’s representative said that the Council was taken hostage by the Russian Federation’s misuse of its veto. Isolated in its actions and its positions, that country never wanted peace or dialogue, she stressed, underscoring that it only wanted the territory of Ukraine., Urging both sides to work towards the immediate cessation of hostilities, the representative of India said that, as an escalation of rhetoric and tension is in no one’s interest, her country abstained on the draft resolution. China’s delegation also abstained, with that country’s representative stating that sanctions and political isolation will not bring peace and will only worsen the situation., Brazil’s delegate stated that the text’s scope and language do not contribute to resolving the conflict, and Gabon’s representative called for good‑faith negotiations and dialogue to end the fighting and promote peaceful coexistence., Ukraine’s representative then described the Council as a broken pillar of the United Nations, noting that other parts of the Organization are resolved to step in and exercise their potential. Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will continue to do so, he underscored, and he characterized the Russian Federation’s presence on the Council as a cancerous tumour that should be removed before it metastasizes. “If the Council cannot act with Russia, it is its duty to act without it,” he stressed., Also speaking today were representatives of the United Kingdom, Norway, Ireland, Ghana, Mexico, Kenya, United Arab Emirates and France., The meeting began at 3:02 p.m. and ended at 4:04 p.m., Statements before Vote, LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said that the draft resolution that her country and Albania have put before the Security Council condemns the illegal so-called “referenda” held in Ukrainian territory, calls on all States not to recognize any alteration of Ukraine and requires that the Russian Federation withdraw its troops from that country immediately. Some people have said that the process leading to this draft resolution was rushed, but “what was rushed was Russia’s illegal act to annex Ukraine’s territory”. The Council must respond, as a Member State — one that is a Council member — is attempting to annex another Member State by force. The outcome of the sham referendums was predetermined in Moscow “and everyone knows it”. However, the Ukrainian people have demonstrated loud and clear that they will never accept subjugation to Russian rule, nor will the United States recognize the territory that the Russian Federation seeks to seize as anything other than part of Ukraine., Everyone has an interest in defending the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, she said, adding that everyone understands the implications if these principles are tossed aside. This issue is bigger than any one nation; it is about collective security. The Council is the first line of defence for the Charter of the United Nations, and it must demonstrate that it can work despite the actions of one permanent member. “This is not a moment to stand on the sidelines,” she said. If the Russian Federation chooses to shield itself from accountability, then the United States will take further steps in the General Assembly to send Moscow an unmistakeable message that the world is still on the side of defending sovereignty and protecting territorial integrity. Recalling that the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, was seen celebrating this clear violation of international law earlier today, she said that the United States will vote in favour of the draft resolution, and urged other Council members to do likewise in defence of international peace and security., BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said that the Russian Federation’s annexations jeopardize prospects for peace and undermine the purpose and principles of the United Nations. Encompassing 90,000 square kilometres, they constitute the largest forcible annexation of territories since the Second World War. “There is no middle ground on this,” she said, adding that this is a simple question of principle, as the Secretary-General has stated. “As members of the Security Council, with a responsibility to maintain international peace and security, and to uphold the United Nations Charter, we must condemn Russia’s actions and vote in favour of the resolution,” she said., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said the Council has never adopted resolutions which directly condemn one of its members. “Do you seriously expect Russia to consider and support such a draft?,” he said, adding that other Council members are pushing his delegation to use its veto, thus enabling them to wax lyrical that the Russian Federation is abusing that right. Referring to the recent referendums, he said that an overwhelming majority in Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson supported their integration into the Russian Federation, despite the provocations of the Kyiv regime. The vote turnout ranged from 76 per cent in the Kherson region to 97 per cent in the Donetsk People’s Republic. “The results of the referendums speak for themselves — the residents of these regions do not want to return to Ukraine,” he said, emphasizing that the referendums were carried out in full conformity with international law., Turning to the draft resolution, he said that the Council had an opportunity to adopt a truly balanced and useful document, as the Russian Federation had constructively proposed amendments regarding the territorial integrity of Member States and the principle of self-determination of peoples. Council members may assess the outcome of referendums differently, but who can argue with the fact that a free expression of the will of people is an essential element of a democratic society, he wondered. On referring the matter to the General Assembly, he hoped that Member States would form their own unbiased views of the situation and make the right choice., Action, The Council then rejected the text by a vote of 10 in favour to 1 against (Russian Federation), with 4 abstentions (Brazil, China, Gabon, India), owing to the negative vote of a permanent member of the Council., Statements after Vote, ALBANA DAUTLLARI (Albania) said the Council was taken hostage and prevented from acting by the Russian Federation’s misuse of its veto. The proposed text concerned the fundamental issues and principles binding Member States in the United Nations, including the preservation of territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence. Isolated in its actions and its positions, the Russian Federation never wanted peace or dialogue. Rather, it only wanted the territory of Ukraine. All States and international organizations must not recognize its acquisition of Ukrainian territory and must refrain from any action that could be interpreted as recognition. By firmly condemning such unacceptable behaviour and standing in defence and support of Ukraine, Member States are defending the rules-based international order, she said, vowing to continue the fight in the General Assembly., MONA JUUL (Norway) said that her delegation voted in favour of the resolution, as the Council has the responsibility to prevent acts of aggression and breaches of territorial integrity. Expressing regret that the resolution was not adopted because of a single member’s veto, she said that it was wrong that the Russian Federation, an invading force, could prevent Council action aimed at ending its aggression. Whatever was announced in Moscow today is contrary to international law, has no legal effect and in no way changes Ukraine’s sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders. The Russian Federation, as a permanent Council member, has a clear responsibility to respect the Charter of the United Nations, but its actions relating to Ukraine go against everything for which the United Nations stands. The Russian Federation is isolating itself from the global community, rejecting international law and ignoring the global consequences of its actions, she said, adding that it is “unacceptable” that the Council has once again been blocked from acting. The General Assembly, however, will have the opportunity to take up this grave and important issue, she said., GENG SHUANG (China), stating that China abstained from the vote, said his country’s position is consistent and clear: sovereignty and territorial integrity must be safeguarded, and all parties’ legitimate security concerns must be taken seriously. Seven months on, the crisis has had considerable negative impacts. He expressed concern about the prospect of a long and protracted crisis and called for efforts to be made to de-escalate tensions and restart diplomatic negotiations. All viable options must be put on the table to achieve an early ceasefire and any action by the Council should aim to ease the situation rather than exacerbate confrontation. Sanctions and political isolation will not bring peace and will only worsen the situation, making it intractable, he said, adding that China will continue to play a constructive role to resolve the crisis., Ms. WOODWARD (United Kingdom) said that the Russian Federation is using its veto to defend its illegal actions. Council members voted in different ways, but not a single other member recognized the illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory. “Russia’s veto does not change that fact,” she said, adding that the announced accession of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions into the Russian Federation is a “fantasy” that has no legal effect. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine is under attack and “the international system is being assaulted in front of our eyes”. The Russian Federation will not succeed in its actions, she said, expressing concern about how much damage will be done and how many lives will be wasted before Moscow comes to this realization., FERGAL MYTHEN (Ireland) said Ireland voted in favour out of its belief that the Council must have a robust response to the Russian Federation’s blatant breach of the Charter of the United Nations in its war of aggression. He reiterated Ireland’s full commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. Recalling his earlier condemnation of the sham referenda in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, he categorically rejected the so-called results and announcements to annex Ukrainian territory. They have no legal effect and are nothing more than a blatant land-grab by the Russian Federation. He described that country’s use of its Council veto as shameful, reprehensible and an attempt to excuse its military action. Going forward, the international community will not be deterred from holding the Russian Federation accountable, he said, calling for the Council to submit a special report on the use of the veto in accordance with General Assembly resolution 76/262 (2021)., CAROLYN ABENA ANIMA OPPONG-NTIRI(Ghana), noting that her delegation voted in favour of the text, expressed regret at the “unsurprising outcome” of the vote. Once again, the offending State’s use of its veto stood in the way of the Council’s ability to exercise its mandate. The Russian Federation’s annexation of occupied territories within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders is illegal and constitutes a serious violation of that country’s sovereignty, she said, adding that it has no legal effect. She called on the Russian Federation to end its aggression against Ukraine, to refrain from further escalatory actions and to embrace a new chapter of peace., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico), recalling that his country has lost territory through annexation following invasion, underscored that it cannot consent to another State also suffering this type of aggression under any circumstances. Mexico’s position has remained clear in its unwavering respect for international law, especially the prohibition of territorial expansion through force. Pointing out that the referendums held in the occupied territory of Ukraine in the context of armed conflict lack any validity under international law, he said that Mexico supports Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders. Further, he supported efforts by the Secretary-General and other actors to promote dialogue and diplomacy to find political means with which to end the war. He added that Mexico voted in favour of today’s resolution., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) said his country abstained from the vote. Affirming the territorial integrity of all States, he said that the actions that took place around the annexation of territories cannot be perceived as legitimate. While welcoming efforts to amend the text to make it more focused and streamlined, he said that its scope and language do not contribute to resolving the conflict. Rather, the draft reflected the dynamics seen in the Council over the past month, when its members failed to agree on any constructive action. The text also did not contribute to the immediate goals of de-escalating tensions and starting peace negotiations. He urged the Council to explore new courses of action, emphasizing that a refusal to consider alternatives will do nothing to bring about a political solution to the conflict., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya) said that since the start of the war in Ukraine, Kenya has consistently called for a cessation of hostilities to allow for dialogue. “Whether this is established now or following a protracted war that can escalate to an extreme danger of international peace and security, a negotiation is inevitable,” he said. Kenya voted in favour of the resolution based on its principled defence of the Charter and the principle of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all Member States. He urged Council members to do more to find a path towards dialogue and diplomacy, rather than turning the Council into an arena for the continuation of conflict by diplomatic means. He concluded by reaffirming Kenya’s recognition of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders., LANA ZAKI NUSSEIBEH (United Arab Emirates) said that territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence are central to peaceful, cooperative and productive relations between States. Those same principles also protect States and ensure the security and stability of all. Self-determination is also a fundamental principle, but tensions need not amount to a zero-sum game. She added that recent developments warranted a clear statement from the Council. Her delegation voted in favour of the text, even though it would have liked more time to engage on substance and edits. She called for all sides to stop escalating and to instead help create the conditions for peace. She also urged the Russian Federation and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table quickly and without preconditions., PARFAIT ONANGA-ANYANGA (Gabon) said that his country voted to abstain. He underscored Gabon’s clear position against war and its support for a diplomatic solution. He called for a cessation of hostilities and good-faith negotiations and dialogue to end the fighting and promote peaceful coexistence. He also reiterated his country’s support for all initiatives geared towards a peaceful resolution., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), Council President for September, spoke in his national capacity to condemn the Russian Federation’s annexation of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Noting that his delegation voted in favour of the resolution, he underscored that these regions — like Crimea — are integral parts of Ukraine. As such, France will never recognize these illegal annexations, nor the results of the fake referenda that preceded them, as they constitute a flagrant violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Welcoming the spirit of compromise reflected in the approach by the United States and Albania to the resolution, he condemned the Russian Federation’s veto of the same, which, once again, shows its irresponsibility in carrying out its duties as a permanent Council member. The Russian Federation stands alone, more than ever, but it is regrettable that the Council was unable to take a unanimous stance to defend the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity — pillars of international law. Underscoring that Ukraine is fighting in its legitimate defence, he stated that France will continue to support that country in countering Russian aggression and recovering full sovereignty over its territory., SERGIY KYSLYTSYA (Ukraine) said that the occupant of the permanent seat of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation, with its lonely hand raised against the resolution, testified to its isolation and its desperate attempts to deny reality, as well as the Charter of the United Nations. “Putin’s envoy has followed in the footsteps of his master, who just put on a puppet show to deny the reality that his aggressive regime is heading to its imminent defeat.” Putin has grabbed territories that he does not physically control, he said, adding that Ukraine’s forces continue to liberate its sovereign territories. Thirty civilians were killed and 88 wounded during the Russian shelling of Zaporizhzhia earlier in the day, he said, adding that the only way to make all Ukrainians feel safe is to hoist Ukrainian flags back through occupied Donbas, southern Ukraine and Crimea. Ukraine has every right to liberate its territories and will continue to do so., The Russian Federation’s actions in the Council prevents that organ from executing its duty to maintain international peace and security, he said, adding that millions around the world are witnessing the Council’s failure to respond to a global threat. Describing the Council as a broken pillar of the United Nations, he said that other parts of the Organization are resolved to step in and exercise their potential. He quoted the Secretary-General’s clear position on recent events, which he called a “dangerous escalation with no place in the modern world”, and called into question Moscow’s “illegal occupation of the Soviet seat in the Council”. He went on to characterize the Russian Federation’s presence on the Council as a cancerous tumor that should be removed before it metastasizes, stressing: “If the Council cannot act with Russia, it is its duty to act without it.”, For information media.

"Ukraine: Research Terms of Reference - Residential Damage Analysis UKR2212, (July 2022, Version 1.0)",Manual and Guideline,REACH,Coordination,30 Sep 2022,"2. Rationale, 2.1. Background info, The escalation of hostilities in Ukraine, on 24 February 2022, has led to a rapid expansion of conflict-affected areas in the East, North and South of Ukraine. Multiple settlements, including large cities with dense built-up cover, were severely damaged between the end of February – April. Additional threats arise from natural disasters for ecosystems located in conflicted-affected areas with cascading negative effects on environment and human well-being.
Numerous incidents of building damage were reported for both living houses and infrastructure in impacted settlements.
While in the first week since the beginning of escalation direct locations and type of damaged objects were transparently revealed, currently such reports in media are forbidden due to security reasons. That led to uncertainty in the understanding of the extent of damage to economics, transport, healthcare, and educational infrastructure in the areas of both ongoing and stopped hostilities.
Remote sensing data is an efficient and safe tool to estimate the occurrence and severity of damage to buildings infrastructure in affected settlements. While acquisition of 3D images by unmanned aerial vehicles (with possibility to visually examine all types of damage to buildings and structures) is rather impossible due to security concerns, high-resolution satellite imagery can be a relevant source of reliable data of conflict impact. Visual interpretation of conflict and post-conflict images in previously known locations of facilities, buildings and infrastructure can support a robust assessment of conflict impact on structures in affected urban areas.
Close cooperation with UNOSAT on the analysis of high-resolution optical satellite imagery is crucial to derive robust estimates of the damage of residential buildings. Those are a data source to calculate the population that lost their shelters.
In larger urban settlements there could be a substantial variation of damage severity linked to local district (neighbourhood) features. Those are the average number of apartments in one building, dominance of private living houses or multi-floor buildings in the district, proximity to large infrastructural objects, road network connectivity. Detection of damage hotspots at neighbourhood level in larger urban settlements (i.e., cities with population > 200,000 citizens) with following affected population estimates might facilitate more convenient planning of shelter needs’ assessments. This analysis of building footprints will result in a consistent flow of informative outputs for interested humanitarian actors and local authorities., 2.2. Intended impact, This assessment aims to report locations where damage to residential buildings should be the highest for humanitarian actors and local authorities. Although remote sensing satellite data cannot fully capture the damage caused by conflict hostilities, it illustrates general trends while field (ground or drone surveys) are restricted or impossible.

Ukraine: Humanitarian Situation Monitoring (September 2022) - Briefing Note: Focus on accountability to affected populations (AAP) and information needs in government controlled areas (GCA),Assessment,REACH,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Protection and Human Rights",30 Sep 2022,"Context and Methodology, As of 23 July 2022, there are estimated to be over 6.6 million people internally displaced in Ukraine.1 Since early April, further escalation in the eastern and southern parts of the country have been causing more damages to infrastructure and disruptions in access to services in affected areas, as well as additional population displacement.2 This briefing note summarizes data on accountability to affected populations (AAP) in government controlled areas (GCA), including the level of satisfaction with and barriers to receiving humanitarian aid, preferred channels of communication and information needs from REACH’s 3 fifth round of Humanitarian Situation Monitoring (HSM) data collection exercise.4 Structured data collection was conducted between July 4th and July 26th through 1658 phone interviews with key informants (KIs) representing non-government organisations (NGOs), local authorities and civil society in 306 settlements in GCA. KI responses were aggregated at settlement level. In addition, 10 long-form semi-structured interviews were conducted with interviewees5 who were displaced to government-controlled areas with high influx of IDPs (5 with IDPs residing outside displacement sites 6 and 5 with IDPs residing at displacement sites 7 ), as well as 5 semi-structured interviews with people who returned to recently liberated areas.8 The findings are not statistically generalisable and should be considered indicative only. Whenever possible, data has been triangulated with secondary data sources., Key highlights, • In most of the cases in assessed GCA settlements, humanitarian assistance reportedly did not help to meet the immediate needs of the population or helped to a limited extent., • Food and medicine were identified by interviewees as the most useful types of humanitarian assistance in the assessed settlements in both GCAs and recently liberated areas., • In the settlements where interviewees reported that people were facing some barriers to accessing aid at distribution sites or reception centres, long waiting lines were the most frequently reported barrier in the assessed settlements both in GCAs and recently liberated areas., • Interviewees also highlighted limited availability of information on where to register for aid or on eligibility criteria, which was consistently one of the main information needs identified by the respondents through structured data collection of HSM Round 5., • Mostly, interviewees reported that some level of consultations were held with various actors in the settlement (including local authorities, volunteers, or residents), and in most of these cases interviewees reported that these consultations made a significant difference, particularly in terms of tailoring following rounds of aid to the needs of the people., • While targeting of humanitarian aid was generally considered as fair and believed to be provided to those most in need, interviewees also shared perceived concerns in relation to some population groups either facing additional challenges or receiving preferential conditions in the aid distribution process, resulting in a level of dissatisfaction with aid targeting among people left out of assistance, or sense of injustice in relation to some people receiving aid more frequently than others., • Interviewees generally reported some level of perceived awareness among people about procedures and referral pathways to report protection issues (such as sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA), gender-based violence (GBV), human trafficking, etc.), and the police or law enforcement bodies were most frequently cited as relevant bodies to report such cases to.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-humanitarian-situation-monitoring-september-2022-briefing-note-focus-accountability-affected-populations-aap-and-information-needs-government-controlled-areas-gca
"Ukraine: Research Terms of Reference - Service Functionality and Damage Assessment UKR2213, (April 2022, Version 1.0)",Manual and Guideline,REACH,Coordination,30 Sep 2022,"2. Rationale, 2.1. Background info, The escalation of hostilities in Ukraine, on 24 February 2022, has led to a rapid expansion of conflict-affected areas in the East, North and South of Ukraine. Multiple settlements, including large cities with dense built-up cover, were severely damaged between the end of February – April. Additional threats arise from natural disasters for ecosystems located in conflicted-affected areas with cascading negative effects on environment and human well-being.
Numerous incidents of building damage were reported for both living houses and infrastructure in impacted settlements.
While in the first week since the beginning of escalation direct locations and type of damaged objects were transparently revealed, currently such reports in media are forbidden due to security reasons. That led to uncertainty in the understanding of the extent of damage to economics, transport, healthcare, and educational infrastructure in the areas of both ongoing and stopped hostilities.
Remote sensing data is an efficient and safe tool to estimate the occurrence and severity of damage to infrastructure in affected settlements. While acquisition of 3D images by unmanned aerial vehicles (with possibility to visually examine all types of damage to buildings and structures) is rather impossible due to security concerns, high-resolution satellite imagery can be a relevant source of reliable data of conflict impact. Visual interpretation of conflict and post-conflict images in previously known locations of facilities and infrastructure can support a robust assessment of conflict impact on infrastructure in affected urban areas.
Close cooperation with UNOSAT on the analysis of high-resolution optical satellite imagery is crucial to derive robust estimates of the damage of various infrastructure types. These estimates will be an essential part of further assessments of conflict impact on markets, healthcare, educational system, transport connection, industry in affected regions., 2.2. Intended impact, This assessment aims to report locations where damage to key infrastructure and service providers (facilities) should be the highest priority for humanitarian actors and local authorities. Estimation of damage to non-residential infrastructure by categories and relative proportions to total infrastructure in region is aimed for indirect assessment of economical loss (e.g., for Area Based Assessments conducted by REACH), and for revision by humanitarian clusters (e.g., Health Cluster, WASH Cluster, Shelter Cluster). Additionally, translations of project products to Ukrainian are intended to inform local policy makers and authorities for more robust planning and management in conflict-affected areas.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-research-terms-reference-service-functionality-and-damage-assessment-ukr2213-april-2022-version-10
"No electricity, gas, or water supply. People in Need and partners support people in liberated areas in eastern Ukraine",News and Press Release,PIN,Water Sanitation Hygiene,30 Sep 2022,"Kyiv (30th of September 2022) - People in Need (PIN), together with local humanitarian partners, started to deliver life-saving assistance to Izium and Balakliia in Kharkiv Oblast in eastern Ukraine just a few days after the settlements became accessible to aid organisations. Fighting severely damaged both towns, including multistoried-apartment buildings, private houses, schools, hospitals, shops, and public infrastructure. There is no electricity, gas, or water supply in the settlements. For months the people living there survived, despite the danger of shelling and the lack of products and services., ""There is no water, no heating, and no electricity, and people are on the verge of starvation. We have no medicine and many problems. We are still shocked,"" shares Viktoria, a resident of Izium, who stayed there during the occupation along with her family. ""Eighty-nine people were staying in our house; half were pensioners, three children, two diabetics, and one who needed kidney dialysis. We had no medication; we had nothing to eat---we used candles to heat food. We drank rainwater that we drew from wells,"" adds Viktoria., To support the residents in Izium, PIN, together with the local partner U.Prava delivered four trucks of drinking water—80,000 litres. A further 80,000 litres were delivered to the residents of Balakliia. Further water deliveries will be made as we continue to support people who have endured the horrors of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine for seven months., According to local authorities, the estimated number of people in Balakliia is between 12,000 and 15,000. These estimates include those who stayed and returnees---however, before the invasion, the number of inhabitants was 27,000. Izium is in a similar situation. The town's population now is 18,000, yet before the invasion, Izium had a population of 46,000. Of the remaining population, there are 700-1000 school-age children., Though most of Izium and Balakliia have been destroyed---the towns are full of gutted apartment blocks, ruined administration buildings, roads, and bridges---life is beginning to return. The residents are getting around on bikes, queuing for aid parcels, water, and other assistance delivered by humanitarians to support those in need., *""My family and I stayed here in Izium, and we did not even consider leaving when it was terrible. This is our home. I was born here, and I don't want to move somewhere else, even if it is not safe. We know that we should be very careful while moving around as there are a lot of mines, but we believe that our town will be safe and will get back to normal life soon,"" *said Olha, a resident of Izium., ""We'll continue supporting people in the Kharkiv Oblast, in Izium, and Balakliia in particular, by delivering water and food. Furthermore, we are planning to supply Emergency Shelter Materials as the needs are crucial. Our team has visited Balakliia and Izium and seen the destruction caused by the hostilities. We have seen private houses and multi-story buildings that sustained serious damage. Local authorities are working to repair supply systems, but the damages are huge, and repairs will take some time. Meanwhile, people are still without electricity, gas and water. Moreover, winter is approaching, and we need to respond to the needs as fast as possible,"" says Sergey Saienko, East Region Director for People in Need Ukraine., Seven months have passed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Whilst People in Need has been helping people in eastern Ukraine since 2014, in February this year, our assistance changed. We immediately increased our team in Ukraine and expanded our operation to almost all the oblasts throughout the country. Since then, we have helped more than 400,000 people, our team on the ground has grown to 260 employees, and generous donors have contributed more than two billion Czech crowns (€80 million) to the Ukraine emergency appeal.

Update 109 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (30 Sep 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,30 Sep 2022,"A landmine explosion has damaged a low-voltage electrical cable near Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), the latest in a series of such detonations this week that have further added to grave concerns about nuclear safety and security at the plant, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today., Yesterday’s blast damaged a 6 kilovolt (kV) cable – which is used to provide power for some plant operations – close to a nitrogen-oxygen facility just outside the ZNPP perimeter fence. Due to a short-circuit of the cable, the explosion indirectly also damaged a voltage transformer at reactor unit 6. There was no fire, but smoke was visible., The IAEA team present at the plant today checked the area and found evidence of a mine blast, with traces of the impact visible in the concrete fence and the cable tray., Ukrainian operating staff said spare parts and other materials were available for the repair of both the cable and the transformer. The repair work will not affect availability of back-up power systems., The incident itself did not result in any direct impact on the safety systems of the ZNPP. It was the sixth landmine explosion reported this week outside the perimeter fence of the plant, which is controlled by Russian forces but operated by its Ukrainian staff., Director General Grossi reiterated his deep concern about this week’s many landmine explosions close to the ZNPP, in an area that has also been hit by frequent shelling in recent months. The Director General said he is continuing his consultations and other efforts aimed at agreeing and implementing a nuclear safety and security zone around the ZNPP as soon as possible.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-109-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-30-sep-2022
Fictitious annexation follows 'voting' at gunpoint [EN/RU/UK],News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,30 Sep 2022,"Sham Vote in Occupied Regions of Ukraine Provides No Legal Basis for Russian Annexation, Yulia Gorbunova
Senior Researcher
@yuliagorbunova_, Vladimir Putin has just signed a document claiming to annex four Russia-occupied Ukrainian territories in Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. Days before, Russia purported to hold “referendums” in these areas, with hastily staged “voting,” in some cases at gunpoint., Just like the so-called referendum in Crimea in 2014, they hold no legal value and don’t provide a basis for annexation or transfer of sovereignty., Russia remains an occupying power in these regions bound by the Fourth Geneva Convention, which continues to protect civilians in those areas. In particular, if Russian authorities conscript civilians from these areas, as they’ve been doing in occupied Crimea and occupied areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, they’ll be committing new war crimes., War crimes under Russian occupation are nothing new. From the start of the occupation, Russian authorities have been suppressing dissent through widespread intimidation, including torture and enforced disappearances. I’ve interviewed dozens of civilians from Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, who shared horrific accounts of beatings, electric shocks, and incommunicado detention at the hands of Russian forces. Many were locked up for days or weeks, blindfolded, with their hands tied., Russian propaganda, predictably, claims people overwhelmingly “voted” to join Russia. Even if there were some genuine supporters, this does not give the process any legal value. Moreover, Ukrainians I spoke to paint a very different picture. Alexey Koshel, the head of Ukraine’s Committee of Voters, described to me how poll workers carried ballots door-to-door accompanied by armed soldiers: “Imagine … [f]our armed men walk into your flat. You have to vote to join Russia, at gunpoint. If you refuse or vote ‘no’, you’ll be doing it right in front of them, they can see what you put on the ballot.”, Several people told me about their experiences over the phone. “Today’s the second day of the pseudo-referendum. It’s morally exhausting … We’re in hiding and intend to hide for the next three days,” a woman from Kherson said. A panic-stricken man in Zaporizhzhia region said: “We’re afraid ... My uncle said that I have to open the door when they come, or the neighbors might report [me]. I will have to tick a box for Russia, or they might tear down my house.”, These sham votes have no legal value but have grave consequences for civilians. The United Nations and numerous governments have rightly condemned Russia’s actions, and it is vital they continue to make all efforts to secure civilians' protection and ensure those responsible for war crimes are held to account.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/fictitious-annexation-follows-voting-gunpoint-enruuk
Role of art in recovery efforts explored at creative industries conference: Cultural icons and artists share passions and best practices in uniting Ukrainians in wartime,News and Press Release,UNDP,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Recovery and Reconstruction",30 Sep 2022,"Ivano-Frankivsk, 30 September 2022 – Art has the power to educate, inspire, motivate and transform, influencing perception, opinion and values across societies and around the world. For this reason, dozens of activists and representatives of creative industries met recently in Ukraine to explore the unifying role of art and culture during wartime. Some of the shared initiatives include a concert in the subway station in Dnipro and musical parties for cleaning up ruble from buildings destroyed by shelling in the villages of Chernihiv Oblast., The “Shum Rave” NGO – an organization displaced from the east, organized the two-day event “Brave Culture Meet Up” in Ivano-Frankivsk to explore ways cultural initiatives and creative projects can unite communities, strengthen volunteerism, help document war events, and accelerate the recovery of devastated by the war communities. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) supported the event, together with the European Union., Frederik Coene, Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation to Ukraine, said that despite the war, the number of new cultural projects in Ukraine is constantly growing, helping to unite communities. “We, together with our partners from UNDP, are glad to support this conference and the creative activists,” he said. “The many brave initiatives implemented despite the full-scale Russian aggression are proof that no weapon in the world can stop Ukrainian culture.”, Manal Fouani, interim UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine, highlighted the importance of supporting cultural and creative social projects in Ukraine during the war. “While this war is destroying infrastructure, cities and villages, Ukrainians are demonstrating a unique resilience and willingness to express themselves creatively to overcome the fear and uncertainties,” Fouani said. “Art and culture often transcend the barriers of violence and hostilities to strengthen the social fabric, communicating unity and defiance. In the history of the world, great movements have been launched and sustained through art and culture, often changing humanity for the better.”, The conference coordinator, Yevhen Skrypnyk, thanked UNDP and the EU for their support in organizing the event. “The preservation of authentic Ukrainian culture has never been as important as it is now, during the war,” Skrypnyk said. “We are very glad that the bold and creative projects implemented by Ukrainians find a response both in Ukraine and in the world. Despite the war, developing at a rapid pace, culture in Ukraine unites communities and accelerates recovery – and this motivates us to work even harder.”, Media enquiries, Yulia Samus, UNDP Ukraine Communications Lead; e-mail: yuliia.samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/role-art-recovery-efforts-explored-creative-industries-conference-cultural-icons-and-artists-share-passions-and-best-practices-uniting-ukrainians-wartime
Ukraine Crisis: 17-23 September 2022,News and Press Release,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,30 Sep 2022,"After retaking most of the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian forces advanced in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions (KyivPost, 22 September 2022; ISW, 23 September 2022). Ukrainian forces also destroyed several Russian command posts and ammunition warehouses in the Kherson region., Meanwhile, a prisoner exchange took place between Ukraine and Russia on 21 September. Russia returned 215 prisoners of war to Ukraine (Government Portal of Ukraine, 22 September 2022; Suspilne Media, 22 September 2022), in exchange for 55 Russian soldiers and the former parliamentary leader of a banned, pro-Russian party (Reuters, 22 September 2022)., On 23 September, Russian occupying forces held so-called ‘referendums’ on joining Russia in the occupied regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia. The ‘referendums’ are widely seen as an illegitimate pretense to annex the regions, with many foreign leaders claiming they will not recognize the results (DW, 28 September 2022). According to Ukrainian officials, Russian forces banned people from leaving occupied areas during the four-day vote, collected people’s votes at their homes while armed, recorded the names of those who voted against joining, and threatened employees with losing their jobs if they did not participate (Reuters, 24 September 2022; BBC, 27 September 2022)., For more information, including previous infographics and an interactive dashboard, visit our Ukraine Crisis research hub.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-17-23-september-2022

To this end, the URCS has commissioned Spanish Red Cross (SpRC) to carry out a national assessment to analyse the impact of the escalation of the conflict on livelihoods and potential recovery options.
The focus of this assessment mission was to assess the specific impact of the escalation of conflict on FSL in Ukraine since February 24th, 2022 and the FSL recovery and provisioning needs to, based on both, propose FSL response options., The FSL assessment team identified FSL response options that are recommended to URCS, based on the revision of secondary data, needs identified, and recommendations made by key informants. Ideally, the preferred options would be those that better respond to the FSL needs of the affected population in the context (rural, urban, semi-urban) in which URCS wants to work, considering at the same time its implementation capacity (or this capacity could be provided with the support of Movement partners)., Response options proposed require further discussion between the URCS and RCRC Movement partners. The assessment report can serve as a methodological guideline and logical basis to guide these further discussions., Identified response options for FSL include actions towards the:, reinforcement of small-scale production1 , especially small-scale farming,, strengthening professional capacity and skills and support to (re)establish small businesses, and, improvement of market linkages at local level which allow small-scale producers and businesses to continue selling their stocks independently of the blockades and constraints of transport routes., Organizational Development (OD) and Capacity Building were also considered in the assessment from the perspective of the FSL response implementation. The impact of the escalation of the conflict on the National Society, including OD and capacity needs for FSL response interventions, were analysed and options were developed accordingly. These were developed with reference to the URCS Strategy 2021-20252 , which although does not mention FSL explicitly, it includes ground for developing ad-hoc and integrated FSL interventions which contribute to the achievement of the URCS’ strategic aims, particularly those related to Emergency Preparedness and Response, Psychosocial Support, and Social services., Some of the identified options require having sufficient management capacity at branch and chapter level which is not the case in some branches and chapters. In addition, Livelihoods recovery and provisioning programming will require adequate supervisory capacity at headquarter level which at the moment of conducting this assessment was limited to one person as Livelihoods Coordinator, who also supports the National Society to covering response needs in other sectors, such as shelter, CVA and relief. This, coupled with the current volatility of the security situation throughout Ukraine, which conditions can deteriorate without warning in any region of the country, made not possible to plan or expect delivery of FSL response activities throughout the country., During the assessment, the coverage of FSL response interventions by districts were discussed with the National Society and refined through a series of discussions. Although URCS has a country wide network of branches, technical and resource capacities are not equal in all regions. FSL interventions and approaches will require to be coordinated, both among RCRC partners and with other humanitarian actors in the country, in order to avoid duplications and increased effectiveness and coverage. Participation in cluster coordination and cluster working groups was recommended by most key informants. All these points should be discussed during detailed FSL response planning, together with the alignment of the intensity of the response intervention to the progressive development of the National Society’s capacity.

"UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is working with the Government and oblast authorities to repair and insulate damaged homes before the winter comes",News and Press Release,UNHCR,Shelter and Non-Food Items,29 Sep 2022,"29 September 2022, Borodianka, Ukraine – Today, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Reintegration of the Temporarily Occupied Territories, Iryna Vereshchuk and UNHCR Representative in Ukraine, Karolina Lindholm Billing visited homes in the Borodianka raion of Kyiv oblast. The homes, which were damaged during shelling earlier this year, were repaired through the UNHCR housing programme in support of the local oblast authorities’ response., Since the start of the invasion of Ukraine in February, almost 14 million people fled their homes in search of safety, and more than 800,000 families have had their homes destroyed or damaged in missile attacks and shelling., In close coordination with the Ukrainian government, its local authorities and communities, UNHCR identifies families with specific vulnerabilities, like older age, disability or low income, who need support to repair their homes. This is part of UNHCR’s contribution to the collective effort to provide people with access to dignified and warm housing during the winter., Following the visit to the families whose homes were repaired, the Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereschchuk said: “We see with our own eyes how the territories of the Kyiv region are being restored and revitalised. Our strategy is to help them rebuild as soon as possible, to ensure safety and to provide them with everything necessary. The residents must be protected and must have the opportunity to heat their homes, buy food or medicine, and receive the services they need. In the Reintegration Plan that we developed together with UNHCR we have clear directions and understanding: who is responsible for what. Here, you can see the results – people get help and know that they are not left alone.”, “The needs across Ukraine are enormous, and UNHCR is committed to doing its part of the joint effort to address these needs. As the winter temperatures can plummet as low as –20 degrees Celsius in parts of the country, UNHCR is racing to repair as many homes as possible before the winter starts so people can stay warm in their homes.” said Karolina Lindholm, UNHCR Representative in Ukraine., Note:, As part of its winterisation response, UNHCR aims to repair and insulate 8,200 houses through its programme of light and medium repairs, to create or improve 14,400 sleeping spaces in collective centres for IDPs who cannot return home and do not have the means to secure private accommodation. Some 337,000 people will receive cash support to cover increased costs associated with the winter period and 567,000 people will receive essential items like thermal blankets, thermoses and heaters. Overall, UNHCR aims to reach more than 940,000 vulnerable individuals in the winterization response to complement the Government’s efforts., For additional information please contact: Victoria Andrievska, Associate Communication/PI Officer, UNHCR Ukraine, andrievs@unhcr.org, +38(044) 288 9710.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unhcr-un-refugee-agency-working-government-and-oblast-authorities-repair-and-insulate-damaged-homes-winter-comes

Widescale destruction of infrastructure, loss of life, and displacement are still being reported as the fighting continues. Missile attacks against a power and heating plant in Kharkiv and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) caused widespread interruptions in the water and energy supplies in several oblasts. Following growing concerns about a potential nuclear disaster, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has called for the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP Plant. As of September 11, the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) stated that there had been over 14,000 confirmed civilian casualties, but the actual numbers are believed to be considerably higher., During a recent visit to Ukraine, the IOM Director General (DG), António Vitorino visited people affected by the war across several areas of Ukraine and met with Ukrainian President Zelensky to discuss the human cost of the war and how IOM can continue to support people in need. The DG also discussed health, and mental health and psychosocial services to displaced people and communities affected by the war with Vice Prime Minster Iryna Vereshchuk and Minister of Health Viktor Liashko., Work in this area is a critical component of IOM’s response in Ukraine, where efforts have focused on boosting the national capacity as well as delivering direct assistance., Since the start of the war in February 2022, IOM has supported approximately 1.1 million Ukrainians, third country nationals (TCNs), and other affected individuals with life-saving water, food and non-food items (NFIs), economic assistance, and healthcare, among other interventions. Beyond meeting humanitarian needs, IOM is committed to supporting sustainable reconstruction and rehabilitation of livelihoods and communities. IOM works with Ukrainian authorities at national and local levels to rebuild and promote community stabilization, including by supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), rehabilitating community infrastructure such as schools and repairing institutions that provide vital support services., IOM’s 8th Ukraine Internal Displacement Report, released 30 August 2022, estimated 6.97 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Ukraine. This represents an increase of almost 330,000 IDPs (5%) from the previous estimate in July. The report noted a pressing need for financial support, medicine and health services, NFIs, hygiene Items, and food since previous rounds. Data from IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix programme continues to be an essential source of information about affected populations and their needs to inform action and policy by the international community and Ukrainian authorities alike.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-regional-ukraine-response-situation-report-28-september-2022

It followed an earlier shipment to Ukraine in July of equipment provided by Australia and procured with French support., The deliveries of donated equipment are organized through the IAEA’s Response and Assistance Network (RANET), where countries can register their capabilities for support in areas ranging from radiation dose assessments and decontamination to nuclear installation assessment and advice, radioactive source search and recovery, and much else. The IAEA also procures equipment using established Agency mechanisms., Separately today, IAEA experts present at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) were informed about two more landmine explosions outside the plant perimeter fence, bringing the total to five this week. One occurred yesterday afternoon in the area of a channel transporting water to the plant for its cooling system, which is essential for nuclear safety. It did not cause any damage. The second explosion took place at 1pm today some 500 metres from reactor unit 1. There was no major damage, but further investigations will be conducted. As the previous three landmine explosions reported by the IAEA this week, they were believed to have been caused by animals., Director General Grossi reiterated his deep concern about the repeated occurrence of such landmine explosions near Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, where frequent shelling has taken place over the past two months.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-108-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-29-sep-2022

Over 200 psychiatric patients evacuated from overcrowded hospital in Kharkiv,News and Press Release,MSF,Health,29 Sep 2022,"Project Update, Over 200 patients with neurological and psychiatric conditions have been evacuated from an overcrowded hospital in Kharkiv city, eastern Ukraine, to facilities in Kyiv on the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) medical train. Before their evacuation, patients had faced extremely challenging conditions, with insufficient access to quality care and hygiene, and some having to sleep on the floor., Healthcare facilities and care institutions on the frontlines in the east and southeast of Ukraine face serious challenges to continue to care for their patients. Many have faced cuts to water and electricity, have trouble meeting basic needs such as food, difficultly accessing the medication their patients need, and extreme danger as fighting rages near their locations., Denys Babiy, MSF nurse, describes feeding patients on board the train, “I worked in a carriage where we had nine bedridden patients,” he says. “When I fed them, they asked for two dishes.”, “People were hungry, we could see their bones and ribs. They looked like they had been malnourished for a long time. It was hard to see,” says Babiy., In early September, these patients had been in a facility on the frontline in Kharkiv oblast (province). An evacuation process was underway when, reportedly, the facility was shelled, killing four medical staff and two patients. Later the patients were transferred to a hospital in Kharkiv city, increasing the number of patients in this hospital from 400 to over 1,000., “After receiving so many patients, despite the best efforts of the staff, the conditions in the hospital became really difficult,” says Borys Potapov, an MSF doctor who accompanied the patients from Kharkiv to Kyiv. “They didn't have enough beds, medication, or staff to take care of everyone.”, MSF was asked by the Ministry of Health to help ease the pressure on the hospital by transferring over 200 patients to facilities in Kyiv. The Ministry of Health selected which patients were to be transferred and informed MSF of their medical conditions but not their origin., “We made two trips in 36 hours, transporting patients with a range of pathologies,” says, Emilie Fourrey, MSF project coordinator, speaking from the train platform in Kyiv. “Some were elderly people with neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s. We also had a lot of patients with acute psychotic disorders, especially today on the final journey.”, “Some of the patients were understandably quite agitated but it went smoothly during the journey to Kyiv,” she says. “The patients will be transferred to two different facilities here, where MSF will follow up to check on their condition.”, MSF operates an ambulance referral service from 11 hospitals near the frontlines in the east and southeast of Ukraine. In the first three weeks of September, 277 patients were transferred to facilities slightly further from the fighting. The vast majority of these patients had suffered violent trauma and were able to receive a good standard of care., However, as the experience of the patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders shows, being transferred from hospitals right on frontlines is no guarantee of receiving adequate healthcare if the hospitals that receive them are overcrowded. This is especially so if patients have complex, chronic health needs. Evacuating patients to hospitals in the west of the country far away from frontlines can alleviate pressure on healthcare facilities., On 27 September, we visited some of the evacuated patients in a psychiatric hospital in Kyiv oblast. A Ministry of Health worker explained that some patients had thanked them, grateful to be in an environment far better than the hospital on the frontlines., Despite these improvements, the patients still have significant health needs, with one nurse remarking that, in their many years of caring for patients in psychiatric facilities, they had never seen patients in such poor mental and physical condition.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/over-200-psychiatric-patients-evacuated-overcrowded-hospital-kharkiv
"Black Sea exports ramp up, bringing confidence to global commerce and food to most vulnerable",News and Press Release,UN News,"Food and Nutrition
Logistics and Telecommunications",29 Sep 2022,"Two months since the Black Sea Grain Initiative kicked into action to help release desperately needed grain and fertilizer from ports in Ukraine and Russia, confidence is returning among global distributors as exports ramp up, UN humanitarians said on Thursday., Described as a “beacon of hope” by UN Secretary-General António Guterres at the signing ceremony for the plan on 27 July in Istanbul, with representatives from Russian and Ukraine, the agreement has made it possible for almost 240 vessels to leave Ukrainian ports with some 5.4 million metric tons of grain and other foodstuffs, since 1 August 2022., “What I am seeing with the Black Sea Grain Initiative is an increase in confidence, confidence in the shipping community, the commercial shipping community,” said Dennis Malone, a UN Representative at the Joint Coordination Centre in Odesa, for boats arriving and departing from the Ukrainian port., “We are seeing the price of shipping insurance reduced, we are seeing the quality of ships that are being used to come in to export the grain are increasing. We are also seeing an increase in confidence in the local community, in the farming community. They are starting to see that their grain is being exported, that the silos are being emptied and that they can start planning for future harvests.”, UN-chartered, One ship in Odesa, the BC Vanessa, is the fourth humanitarian vessel to be chartered by the UN World Food Programme (WFP) out of Ukraine. After it left Ukrainian waters, its cargo was inspected in Istanbul, as with all of the ships which are part of the initiative., Its precious cargo - 30,000 tonnes of wheat - is destined for Afghanistan, to alleviate the desperate humanitarian emergency there., Other UN shipments taking part in the initiative have already delivered wheat to Ethiopia and Yemen., One result of the deal has been a sharp drop in global food prices, which has allowed consumers to purchase grain more easily, once again., Ukraine, one of the world’s largest grain exporters, normally supplies around 45 million tonnes to the global market every year., ‘Matter of survival’, After Russia’s invasion of the country on 24 February, mountains of grain built up in silos, with ships unable to secure safe passage to and from Ukrainian ports. Today, although sea routes are open again, serious economic challenges remain for the country’s farmers., “For the moment, the prices offered are too low,” said Vyachyslav Nevmerzhytskyi, Deputy Chairman of the Association of Farmers of the Odesa region. “Today, I would be selling at a loss because the cost to grow and produce the grain remains (higher)., “So, if I agree to sell at these prices now then I would be making a loss. Therefore, this is a matter of survival, the financial survival of (my) farm businesses.”, Waiting game, Transporting the grain to the ports also remains incredibly slow. Truck drivers wait in kilometre-long lines to get reach Yuzhny port and some have been stationary for days., “After the truck is loaded, it takes three to four hours for me to get here, ready for discharge,” one drive told UN News. “But I've been standing (here) for five days. There is no movement, there is no administration, there is no-one to explain how long we will stay here, what to do, to move, to go home.”, In line with the Black Sea Grain Initiative, Ukrainian vessels guide cargo ships seeking passage to and from Odesa, Chornomorsk and Yuzhny, through a maritime humanitarian corridor in international waters. Their task is to steer well clear of stretches of water that have been mined., Stops on the way, Once the ships near Istanbul, they are inspected by teams from another Joint Coordination Centre based in the Turkish city – as was the case for the BC Vanessa on Wednesday – with representatives from Russia, Türkiye, Ukraine and the UN all involved., Loaded with humanitarian supplies, the vessel then left Istanbul’s waters, setting a westerly course for the Turkish port of Samsun, where its wheat will be milled., The flour will then be shipped onto another vessel to Karachi and then transported by road to Afghanistan for distribution.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/black-sea-exports-ramp-bringing-confidence-global-commerce-and-food-most-vulnerable

"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (17 - 23 September 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,23 Sep 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, Russia announced a 'partial' mobilization ahead of 'referendums' in occupied territories of Ukraine amid the ongoing military invasion of Ukraine. News of the mobilization drove an increase in demonstration activity in Russia and other European countries. Fighting continued at lower levels along the Armenia-Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan borders compared to the week prior. Meanwhile, the death of an Iranian woman held in custody by Iran's 'morality police' sparked demonstration activity across Europe. Demonstrations against climate change and rising costs of living were also recorded across the region., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. Following the de-occupation of most of the Kharkiv region the week prior, Ukrainian forces advanced in the Luhansk region and in the area of Lyman in the Donetsk region (KyivPost, 22 September 2022; ISW, 23 September 2022). These trends contribute to the 160% increase in violent events in the Luhansk region last week relative to the weekly average for the preceding month flagged by ACLED's Subnational Surge Tracker; the tool also warned of increased violence in the region during the preceding four weeks. Ukrainian forces also destroyed several Russian command posts and ammunition warehouses in the Kherson region., Russian forces continued to launch shelling and airstrikes targeting civilian infrastructure along the frontline, killing over 40 civilians last week.1 At least three more civilians were killed and 13 were wounded in landmine explosions in the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions., Meanwhile, on 21 September, a prisoner exchange took place between Ukraine and Russia. Russia returned 215 prisoners of war to Ukraine, including soldiers of the Azov Battalion captured in Mariupol in May and foreign soldiers sentenced to death by Russian-led rebel forces in Donetsk (Government Portal of Ukraine, 22 September 2022; Suspilne Media, 22 September 2022). In exchange, Ukraine returned 55 Russian soldiers and the former parliamentary leader of a banned, pro-Russian party (Reuters, 22 September 2022)., Separately, Russia launched so-called 'referendums' on 23 September in four occupied regions to join Russia, namely Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia. The 'referendums' are widely seen as an illegitimate pretense to annex the regions, with many foreign leaders claiming they will not recognize the results (DW, 28 September 2022). According to Ukrainian officials, Russian forces banned people from leaving occupied areas during the four-day vote, collected people's votes at their homes while armed, recorded the names of those who voted against joining, and threatened employees with losing their jobs if they did not participate (Reuters, 24 September 2022; BBC, 27 September 2022)., In Russia, nationwide demonstrations erupted on 21 September in response to the announcement by Russian President Vladimir Putin of a 'partial' mobilization to fill the ranks of Russian forces in Ukraine (TV Rain, 21 September 2022). While 'hidden mobilization' has been occurring for months, the Kremlin has announced its intent to draft 300,000 soldiers, with opposition outlets claiming it plans to conscript more than a million men (ISW, 23 September 2022). Anti-mobilization demonstrations announced by Russian opposition movement Vesna took place in dozens of towns, with police dispersing demonstrations and arresting demonstrators and journalists. In Moscow and St. Petersburg, police beat people with rubber batons and, in one instance, broke a protester's arm during their arrest (OVD Info, 21 September 2022; OVD Info, 22 September 2022). Some detained demonstrators received conscription notices upon arrival at police stations (TV Rain, 22 September 2022). In the two days following the mobilization announcement, six military recruitment offices and four administration buildings were set on fire by unidentified arsonists in different regions (Activatica, 22 September 2022; Activatica, 23 September 2022)., Meanwhile, pro-government rallies were organized across the country on 23 September in support of the Russian 'referendums' in occupied Ukrainian regions. In dozens of cities, students reported having been pressured to take part in the rallies by university administrations (Meduza, 23 September 2022)., Elsewhere, demonstrations against the mobilization in Russia were held in several European countries last week. The rallies, many organized by Russians living abroad, took place in Cyprus, Finland, Norway, Serbia, and Sweden. Demonstrations in solidarity with Ukraine also took place in Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy., Along the Armenia-Azerbaijan Line of Contact, ceasefire violations continued almost daily, however, at a lower level than the week prior. At least one Armenian serviceman was wounded as a result of Azerbaijani fire in the Syunik region of Armenia., Fighting also decreased along the disputed border between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan last week compared to the week prior. Despite a ceasefire agreement between the two countries (DW, 16 September 2022), shelling and battles took place in the Batken and Osh regions of Kyrgyzstan and the Lakhsh district of Tajikistan on 17 September. The violence contributed to the 33% increase in violent events in Kyrgyzstan last week relative to the weekly average for the preceding month. ACLED's Conflict Change Map warned of increased violence in the country during the preceding four weeks., The death of Mahsa Amini in Iran sparked demonstration activity across Europe last week. The 22-year-old ethnic-Kurd-Iranian woman died on 16 September in custody, after being arrested by Iran's 'morality police' for not wearing her *hijab *according to the country's law (BBC, 16 September 2022). Members of the Iranian community and women gathered in Belgium, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the United Kingdom to protest against the Iranian government and express support for ongoing demonstrations in Iran following Amini's death., Meanwhile, climate demonstrations were held in Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden to coincide with the Global Climate Strike organized on 23 September by the Fridays for Future movement., Demonstration activity linked to rising living costs, inflation, and energy prices also continued to take place across the region last week, with protests recorded in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Moldova, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, and the United Kingdom.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-17-23-september-2022

Russia/Ukraine: Illegitimate results of sham ‘referenda’ must not enable illegal annexation of occupied areas,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,28 Sep 2022,"Responding to Russia’s announcement of the “results” of the so-called “referenda” in the Ukrainian territories it occupies in the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions, Denis Krivosheev, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said:, “There is no legitimacy whatsoever in the results of these sham “referenda” announced by the Russian authorities. It is absurd that the Russian authorities would think these so-called votes, which took place at gunpoint in the presence of Russian soldiers and their proxies, are in any way credible. The whole exercise, which is illegal under international law, is nothing more than another deplorable act in Russia’s strategy of aggression against Ukraine.”, “The “referenda results” do not change the legal status under international law of the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia, no matter what Russia chooses to declare next. As with Crimea, any moves towards annexation will be illegal, and constitute yet another flagrant violation of international law by Russia., “Amnesty International reiterates its call on Russia to respect its obligations as the occupying power under international humanitarian law. We also call for the immediate cessation of all unlawful actions by Russia, including its war of aggression against Ukraine and accompanying human rights violations. All those responsible for crimes under international law, including war crimes, must face justice.”, Background, On Tuesday, the Russia-backed “administrations” of occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine and the de facto authorities of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk “People’s Republics” announced the results of the unlawful “referenda” on joining Russia. The organizers claimed very high turnout and majorities of between 87% to 99.2% in favour of joining Russia. This “voting” and any other measures by Russia or its proxies to change the status of occupied territory is a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention., The head of the Council of Federation (the Russian Parliament’s upper house), Valentina Matvienko, said the chamber – which is required to approve annexation under Russian law – may consider the formal incorporation of territories on 4 October., The “referenda” were hastily arranged, taking place over five days with voting organized at so-called polling stations only on the last day, 27 September. Apart from the last day, “ballots” were collected from residents at their home by organizers who went door to door. According to reports in the media and on social media, “voting” at home and at polling stations was often carried out in the presence of heavily armed uniformed men., Amnesty International has received reports of brutal reprisals by the occupying authorities against local people who displayed or were suspected of disloyalty to Russia and its occupying forces.

"Ukraine receives close to 700,000 doses of polio vaccine from UNICEF [EN/UK]",News and Press Release,UNICEF,Health,27 Sep 2022,"The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has delivered 600,000 doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and 99,720 doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) to Ukraine, thanks to financial assistance from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Japanese Government., Ukraine received the vaccines free of charge as humanitarian aid., ""Around a year ago, we recorded an outbreak of poliomyelitis in Ukraine, so we undertook additional immunisation activities,"" said Deputy Minister of Health, Chief State Sanitary Doctor Ihor Kuzin. ""Currently, the threat of polio spreading is here to stay and has even worsened because of the war. That's why our priority is to ensure vaccination for all children who require it. I am grateful to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for systematic assistance to our country and its future."" – says Deputy Minister of Health and Chief State Sanitary Doctor Ihor Kuzin., ""The Ukrainian health care system is facing incredible challenges,” said Murat Sahin, UNICEF Representative in Ukraine. “Together with our partners, we are working to ensure that, despite the war, children and adults in Ukraine receive timely protection from infectious diseases. The polio outbreak in the country is ongoing – if your child missed their polio vaccination, please make sure to catch up as soon as possible.”, Polio is a highly contagious disease caused by the polio virus that affects the nervous system and can lead to paralysis or even death. Paralysis can be lifelong, and many polio victims become disabled as a result of the disease. Five to ten per cent of paralysed people die due to damage to the respiratory muscles., In the absolute majority of cases, carriers of poliomyelitis, who spread it, cannot be detected due to the absence of any signs of the disease. Polio is passed from child to child and can infect them without any symptoms until it paralyses one unvaccinated child., All unvaccinated people can get polio – both adults and children., There is no cure for polio, but it can be effectively prevented by vaccination., There are two types of safe and effective vaccines:, Inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV) – administered by injection., Oral polio vaccine (OPV) – two drops in the mouth., According to the Ukrainian vaccination schedule, a child receives 6 doses of the polio vaccine – at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 18 months, 6 years, and 14 years., The first two vaccinations are given with the IPV vaccine (intramuscular injection), and the remaining vaccinations are usually given with the OPV vaccine (drops in the mouth). OPV is a live vaccine that contains live, weakened polio viruses. Thanks to this vaccine, local immunity is also formed in the intestine, which prevents further spread of the virus., Media contacts, Olha Pryshko, Communications Specialist, UNICEF in Ukraine, Email: opryshko@unicef.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-receives-close-700000-doses-polio-vaccine-unicef-enuk

Update 107 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (28 Sep 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,28 Sep 2022,"Animals are likely to have triggered three landmine explosions close to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) this week, causing no major damage but once again underscoring potential nuclear safety risks at the facility, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) learnt at the site today., At 6am this morning local time, one landmine exploded about 50 metres outside the ZNPP’s plant perimeter fence., It was also confirmed that the two explosions yesterday morning were also likely caused by animals moving in an area with mines outside the fence. The IAEA reported yesterday that the explosions occurred near a channel that carries water from a reservoir to the plant for its cooling system – essential for the safety of the plant – but that the cause was unclear. Windows in a reactor turbine hall were broken., IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi expressed deep concern about this week’s landmine explosions close to the ZNPP, in addition to frequent shelling at or near the plant over the past two months., In a report issued shortly after he led a team of IAEA experts to the ZNPP on 1 September, Director General Grossi said “there is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means. This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone.”, Last week in New York, the Director General began talks with Russia and Ukraine aimed at agreeing and implementing such a zone, and he told the IAEA General Conference on Monday that he was ready to continue consultations in both countries.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-107-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-28-sep-2022

"USG DiCarlo: ""so-called 'referenda'"" held by Russian Federation on occupied Ukrainian territory ""cannot be called a genuine expression of the popular will""",News and Press Release,UN DPPA,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",28 Sep 2022,"Mr President,, The exceptional level of attention to the war in Ukraine reflects the wide-spread global concern about its dangerous and far-reaching consequences., This concern can only deepen, as the most recent developments in the war are ominous, pointing to more death, destruction and suffering., Indeed, since the last Council meeting on Ukraine on 22 September, we have seen actions that threaten to further escalate the conflict., As we meet, so-called “referenda” were just conducted by de facto authorities in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia regions. Ukrainians were asked whether they approved their regions joining the Russian Federation. Voting took place in polling centers. De-facto authorities accompanied by soldiers also went door-to-door with ballot boxes., These exercises, which began on 23 September, have been held during active armed conflict, in areas under Russian control and outside Ukraine’s legal and constitutional framework. They cannot be called a genuine expression of the popular will., Unilateral actions aimed to provide a veneer of legitimacy to the attempted acquisition by force by one State of another State’s territory, while claiming to represent the will of the people, cannot be regarded as legal under international law., Let me reiterate here that the United Nations remains fully committed to the sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders, in accordance with relevant UN resolutions., I would like to recall that, as the occupying power, the Russian Federation is obliged under international humanitarian law to respect the laws of Ukraine in the administration of occupied territories., Mr. President,, The past few weeks have also seen heavy fighting in southern Ukraine in the direction of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, as well as escalating military operations in Donetsk and Luhansk regions., In mid-September, the Ukrainian military undertook a successful counter-offensive to restore Ukrainian control over most of the Russian-held areas in Kharkiv region., We have continued to see not only daily attacks on many Ukrainian cities, including in Donetsk and Luhansk, but also the targeting of civilian energy and water infrastructure, reportedly by Russian forces. Recent reports of drone attacks in and around Odesa are also deeply disturbing., To date, OHCHR has recorded 14,844 civilian casualties, with 5,996 persons killed and 8,848 injured. This is 278 more civilians killed, and 649 more injured since I last briefed this Council on 7 September. These are verified individual incidents; actual figures are likely considerably higher., We have also heard alarming rhetoric regarding the use of nuclear weapons. This is unacceptable., Such rhetoric is inconsistent with the Joint Statement of the Leaders of the Five Nuclear-Weapons States on Preventing Nuclear War and Avoiding Arms Races, made on 3 January 2022., Let me reiterate the Secretary-General’s appeal for all nuclear-armed states, including the Russian Federation, to recommit to the non-use and progressive elimination of nuclear weapons., Mr. President,, Amid these grim developments, the United Nations continues to work to alleviate the suffering caused by the war, to support accountability for violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, and to prevent the deterioration of the already volatile situation around Ukraine’s nuclear sites., UN and partner organizations need safe and unimpeded access to deliver life-saving assistance to all in need. In the areas of Kharkiv region back under Ukrainian control, they were able to organize several aid convoys., However, in areas outside Government control in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia regions, access is the biggest challenge., Mr. President,, The Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine continues to report on violations of human rights and international humanitarian law., We are gravely concerned by allegations of violations committed in parts of north-eastern Ukraine, including after the recovery of over 400 bodies from improvised graves in Izium., OHCHR is working with local authorities to investigate this and other allegations of human rights violations and abuses in areas in Kharkiv region that were until recently under Russian control., There are other extremely disturbing reports. Following investigations in the areas of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, mandated by, the Human Rights Council has concluded that war crimes were committed in Ukraine., Among other findings, the Commission was struck by the large number of executions and other violations carried out by Russian forces. In the four areas it covered, the Commission has processed two incidents of ill-treatment against Russian Federation soldiers by Ukrainian forces., Rarely, if ever, has the international community collected so much evidence of human rights violations, war crimes and other atrocities as they were happening., It is tragic that we have not been able to stop them. But it would be shameful if we were not able to ensure justice for the victims and their loved ones. Those responsible for the outrages being committed in Ukraine, wherever they sit, must be brought to account., Mr. President,, We remain deeply troubled by reports of continuing attacks, as recently as last week, in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant. The UN continues to support the efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency., We urge all concerned to provide maximum cooperation with the IAEA. It is imperative that all attacks on nuclear facilities end, and that the purely civilian nature of such plants be re-established., Mr. President,, By now, the global implications of this war on food and energy security, felt by millions of people, are well-known. During the general debate, many Member States decried this predicament., The Black Sea Grain Initiative continues to gather pace, with more than 4.5 million metric tons of foodstuff shipped from Ukrainian ports, including to the Horn of Africa, Yemen and Afghanistan., Efforts to remove remaining obstacles to the export of Russian food products and fertilizers also continue. These products are not under sanctions, and it is crucial to get them back to world markets., Averting a global food crisis makes it vital to renew the Black Sea Grain deal when it expires at the end of November., Mr. President,, In his remarks to the General Assembly, the Secretary-General warned that the UN Charter and its ideals are in jeopardy, and that we have a duty to act., I repeat his appeal to all Member States to help prevent further escalation, and to do all we can to end the war and ensure lasting peace - in accordance with the principles of the Charter and international law., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/usg-dicarlo-so-called-referenda-held-russian-federation-occupied-ukrainian-territory-cannot-be-called-genuine-expression-popular-will

"Registration, Targeting and Deduplication: Emergency Response inside Ukraine Thematic paper",Analysis,CALP Network,Coordination,28 Sep 2022,"Introduction, Six months after the Russian invasion, Ukraine has rapidly become one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. As of 23rd of July 2022, 6.3 million people are internally displaced1. Out of the 10.4 million people recorded to have crossed the border to other countries, approximately 4 million have returned to Ukraine2. With functioning markets in most of the territory, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) prioritized Multipurpose Cash Assistance (MPCA) as the most appropriate humanitarian assistance for the Ukraine crisis. According to the Ukraine Cash Working Group (CWG), there are currently 28 cash actors with operational presence in Ukraine3 who report their activities to the CWG, and the cash sector is delivering 492 million USD to people in need4., The CALP Network is the co-facilitator of a Learning Group (LG) working under the governance of the CWG. The overall objective of this group is to strengthen the ongoing cash response in Ukraine through the analysis of existing learning and documentation of lessons and good practises to inform other cash responses globally. This thematic paper will contribute to learning, documenting key lessons learnt, emerging critical issues, and real-time recommendations., Methodology and limitations, The researchers have used participatory approaches to ensure that the perspectives and insights of all key stakeholders are taken into consideration. Primary data collection was conducted mainly through key informant interviews (KIIs) with CVA actors. The CWG co-leads provided the list of key contacts, complemented by CALP. 33 key informants (KIs) were interviewed, and the first draft of the research paper was reviewed by a number of cash practitioners members of the Learning Group and the various Task Teams. Two workshops were organised with the LG:, Prioritisation exercise and selection of the three priority thematic learning areas5, which will appear as research papers., Discussion some of the key findings from the KIIs, Secondary research was conducted via a review of key publications relevant to the selected theme, from various contexts., The researchers conducted all the data collection remotely, through video conferences and online workshops. Due to the scope of work, the researchers did not directly interview cash recipients to ascertain perceptions of CWG members' programmes. Equally, the depth of the analysis has been contingent on the KIs' availability and the information shared. The secondary data review was limited to studies in the public domain, documents shared by CALP, and the researchers' own experience, especially since the majority of KIs could not identify other crises where relevant good practises have emerged, nor share relevant unpublished work. For example, there aren't any published lessons learnt6 or evaluations around the deduplication system currently used in Ukraine, although it has been tested in other contexts, and is currently used at scale in Jordan and Bangladesh. Limited research has been published on the Ukraine crisis escalation to date.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/registration-targeting-and-deduplication-emergency-response-inside-ukraine-thematic-paper

With a working knowledge of MAG’s provision of quality clearance and educational activities, UMCOR is now partnering with MAG to support the establishment of operations in Ukraine and all the administrative activities that go along with it., “One of the tragedies of war is its impact on innocent civilians who played no part in the cause of the conflict,” said Roland Fernandes, general secretary of the General Board of Global Ministries of The United Methodist Church, which includes the United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR). “Mine clearance and education are critically needed in Ukraine due to extensive contamination and the trend of people returning from Western Ukraine and abroad who may not be aware of the precise location of where these weapons designed to kill or maim are located.”, Darren Cormack, chief executive of MAG, said: “I have been in Kyiv seeing first-hand the devastating effects of the conflict. The use of heavy artillery, landmines, cluster munitions, both in rural and populated areas, has left a devastating and deadly legacy. Land that should be used for agriculture, or homes that should provide shelter for children to play and sleep, especially as we go into the hard Ukrainian winter, are too risky to be used., “The challenges ahead are monumental and potentially growing as new territory is liberated in Kharkiv, a city and region that has undergone months of intense, bitter ground-fighting accompanied by a brutal artillery campaign., “This UMCOR funding is of critical importance because it will enable us to scale-up and accelerate our efforts to keep people safe, working in close co-operation with local partners.”, Ukraine has signed the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty that comprehensively prohibits all types of victim-activated explosive devices.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",28 Sep 2022,"Executive Summary, Conflict, If Ukrainian forces can hold the significant areas of territory they are reported to have recaptured in recent weeks, or indeed have continued success, it is likely that more areas will be accessible for humanitarian assistance. Reclaimed areas have been characterised by widespread UXO and mine contamination as well as significant damage to civilian infrastructure impacting utilities such as heating, gas, electricity and telecoms as well as the loss of many civilian homes. In addition, attacks on Ukrainian urban centres continue to be a danger with Kharkiv city reporting attacks on power and water supplies causing a blackout for large sections of the city., Displacement, The displacement picture remains volatile with IDP numbers rising by 330,000 over the last month.
The situation is somewhat confused by the number of returnees, currently estimated at just over six million, however many of these are likely to be temporary in nature. Conflict and safety remain the biggest push/pull factors, but access to services and employment also feature highly. The largest number of IDPs now reside in the eastern-macro region, which is also where the majority of IDPs originate (61%). This will place a lot of strain on areas close to the conflict front lines, areas that are also furthest to reach in terms of supplies and logistics. The average IDP household size has been reducing, perhaps as some family members return, but the number of vulnerable groups across the IDP population remains significant., Humanitarian Access, Humanitarian access is heavily constrained by conflict in the east and south of the country with much of the assistance being provided to front line areas by government workers and national NGOs.
Access to NGCAs is severely limited and there is little information on the humanitarian situation in cities such as Mariupol and Kherson. Evacuations from areas close to the frontline in the east have been proceeding, however over 330,000 residents are estimated to remain in Donetska oblast.
Logistical challenges are another barrier with widespread destruction to the road and rail network disrupting supply routes. In addition, the high cost of fuel is particularly impacting local NGOs., Humanitarian Conditions, The conflict in Ukraine has had major impacts on humanitarian conditions. Damages and fear of violence have led close to seven million of individuals to flee their homes while hundreds of others have remained in conflict-affected areas, facing restricted access to goods, services and assistance and risking protection incidents. At least 5,663 civilians have died since February and 8,055 were wounded, including 365 children killed and 623 wounded., The stress coupled with the trauma have left an estimated 15 million people in need of psychological care throughout the country., Moreover, with large-scale migration within the country, including many trying to return to their area of origin, transmission of communicable diseases is facilitated, resulting in several outbreaks. The lack of healthcare services, the crowded and poor conditions of shelter and the lack of access to safe water are worsening the risks of diseases. Six million people are estimated to be having limited or reduced access to piped water.
Costs of services and goods are also putting pressure on the households and leading them to adopt negative coping strategies. By July, over 35% of families reported using food-based coping mechanisms at or above crisis levels. Both the costs of food (28% annual increase of food basket) and of medicines (between 10 and 25% since January) are putting at risk the health of families who may suffer from nutrition problems and from untreated noncommunicable diseases., As winter approaches, increased risks are expected to appear for vulnerable households, with heightened needs of heating supplies and electricity, notably in conflict-affected areas and for displaced persons struggling to find appropriate accommodation before winter.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukrainian-crisis-situational-analysis-23-sep-2022
Ukraine Crisis: Rapid Gender and Conflict Analysis: Poltava Oblast (August 2022),Analysis,CESVI,"Gender
Protection and Human Rights",28 Sep 2022,"INTRODUCTION & METHODOLOGY, The humanitarian situation in Ukraine remains dire with few signs of improvement as war continues in the eastern and southern regions of the country. Significant numbers of people continue to be displaced from the shifting front lines, with the total number of internally displaced individuals currently at 6.9 million as of end August 2022. Most of those newly displaced tend to seek refuge in nearby oblasts (administrative divisions) in eastern Ukraine rather than the west of the country where living costs are much higher., To help guide humanitarian programming in Poltava Oblast, the Joint Emergency Response in Ukraine (JERU), a joint program between Welthungerhilfe, Concern Worldwide, and CESVI, in partnership with Light of Hope, conducted ten focus groups in Machukhy and Novi Sanzhary villages to better understand gender and conflict dynamics of the humanitarian crisis in the surrounding districts. It provides additional primary evidence to build on previous analyses, including those from CARE International and UN Women., Focus groups were divided along the following gender, age, and displacement status:, 1 . Displaced women aged 25 – 60., 2 . Displaced men aged 25 – 60., 3 . Displaced young men and women aged 18-24, 4 . Displaced elderly men and women aged over 60., 5 . Residents: male and female aged 18 and above., These five groups were each held in Machukhy and Novi Sanzhary villages between 26th and 29th August (reaching a total of ten focus groups), with participants invited from a sample of those registered as receiving humanitarian support. This focus group breakdown and participants were selected to include a diversity of genders, ages, locations, and vulnerabilities, within the resource limitations for this analysis.

"So-Called Referenda during Armed Conflict in Ukraine ‘Illegal’, Not Expression of Popular Will, United Nations Political Affairs Chief Tells Security Council",News and Press Release,UN SC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",27 Sep 2022,"9138TH MEETING (PM)
SC/15039, Delegates Condemn ‘Sham’ Annexation Polls by Russian Federation in Occupied Ukraine Territories, Call for Resumption of Peace Talks, The so-called “referenda” conducted by de facto authorities in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine have been held during active armed conflict in the country and cannot be called a genuine expression of the popular will, the United Nations senior political and peacebuilding official told the Security Council today, as members condemned the Russian Federation’s “sham referenda”, while others called for a return to peace talks., “Unilateral actions aimed to provide a veneer of legitimacy to the attempted acquisition by force by one State of another State’s territory, while claiming to represent the will of the people, cannot be regarded as legal under international law,” Rosemary DiCarlo, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs emphasized. She added that the exercises, which began on 23 September, have been held during active armed conflict, in areas under Russian control and outside Ukraine’s legal and constitutional framework., “The United Nations remains fully committed to the sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” she underscored. As the occupying Power, the Russian Federation is obliged under international humanitarian law to respect the laws of Ukraine in the administration of occupied territories. She warned that recent developments, including heavy fighting, escalating military operations, human rights violations and attacks in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, point to more death and destruction. Member States must do all they can to end the war and ensure lasting peace., Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, addressed the Council via a pre-recorded video statement, highlighting that Moscow is conducting a sham referenda on the occupied territory of Ukraine. People are being forced to fill out papers while threatened with guns and results have been prepared well in advanced. He condemned the annexation of the captured territories as an attempt to steal the territory of another State and erase the norms of international law. “There is only one way to stop it all,” he said, calling for complete isolation of the Russian Federation, its exclusion from all international organizations and further sanctions against Moscow., In the ensuing debate, delegates questioned the legitimacy of the referenda, with Brazil’s representative stressing that “it is unreasonable to assume that populations in areas in conflict can freely express their will”. Referenda on questions of sovereignty should be conducted transparently, without restrictions on freedom of expression and allowing for monitoring by independent observers. The referenda in Ukraine are “yet another step that leads to an escalation of the conflict,” he warned., Likewise, the speaker for Albania stressed that, “when you vote at gunpoint, the process is more expedited”, describing the forced conditions in which the referenda are taking place. The holding of such referenda violates the Constitution of Ukraine, Ukraine’s martial law, and runs contrary to the United Nations Charter, international law and the principles the Russian Federation should uphold as a permanent Security Council member. He urged support for a joint resolution his country is co-sponsoring with the United States and called on Member States to support Ukraine in defending itself and getting its territory back., The representative of the United States said that her country will never recognize any seized or annexed territory of Ukraine as anything other than a part of it. It will, thus, continue to provide “historic amounts of support for Ukraine”. She said the resolution her delegation intends to introduce will condemn the sham referenda, call on Member States to refrain from recognizing any altered status of Ukraine, and obligate the Russian Federation to withdraw its troops from the country., Some delegates, including Ghana, United Arab Emirates, India and Kenya, urged the cessation of hostilities, with the latter also echoing others’ concerns about the threats of the use of weapons of mass destruction. Noting the most powerful actor’s prioritization of this conflict over other crises, he pointed out that, in Eastern Africa, fertilizer prices have doubled, fuel prices have risen sharply, and cereal production is predicted to shrink 16 per cent this year. “It is a matter of life or death for all actors to respond to the food insecurity crisis,” he stressed., The representative of the Russian Federation asserted that, “if the West forced its subordinates in Kyiv to uphold the basic human rights and respect for their compatriots and their right to life”, Moscow’s special operations would not have been needed. Over the next few days, the results of the referenda held in the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions will be published. It is a long-awaited event for the inhabitants of Donbass who have been living in constant fear for their lives and sought to bring peace to their land, he said., Also speaking today were representatives of Ireland, United Kingdom, Mexico, China, Norway, Gabon and France., At the outset of the meeting, the representative of the Russian Federation voiced opposition to the participation of the President of Ukraine via video teleconference, noting that such participation must be made in person., The meeting began at 3:05 p.m. and ended at 4:43 p.m., Rules of Procedure, VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), at the outset of the meeting, noting the participation of Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy by video teleconference, said his delegation is not against the participation of the President of Ukraine or his representatives. However, such participation must be in person as required by the rules, which have governed the work of the Council for 70 years. The Council should not turn into a forum for political shows or cinema. “Connivance in these matters causes very serious harm to the prestige of the Council,” he said., Briefing, ROSEMARY DICARLO, Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, [said](https://reliefweb.int/node/389080: “The most recent developments in the war are ominous, pointing to more death, destruction and suffering.” Actions seen since the last Council meeting on Ukraine on 22 September threaten to further escalate the conflict, she underscored, pointing to the so-called “referenda” just conducted by de facto authorities in the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Ukrainians were asked whether they approved their regions joining the Russian Federation, she recounted, adding that voting took place in polling centres. De facto authorities accompanied by soldiers also went door to door with ballot boxes. These exercises, which began on 23 September, have been held during active armed conflict, in areas under Russian control and outside Ukraine’s legal and constitutional framework. They cannot be called a genuine expression of the popular will. Unilateral actions aimed to provide a veneer of legitimacy to the attempted acquisition by force by one State of another State’s territory, while claiming to represent the will of the people, cannot be regarded as legal under international law, she underscored., “The United Nations remains fully committed to the sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine, within its internationally recognized borders, in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions,” she continued. As the occupying Power, the Russian Federation is obliged under international humanitarian law to respect the laws of Ukraine in the administration of occupied territories. In the past few weeks, there has been heavy fighting in southern Ukraine in the direction of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, as well as escalating military operations in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In mid-September, the Ukrainian military undertook a successful counteroffensive to restore Ukrainian control over most of the Russian-held areas in the Kharkiv region. Daily attacks continue on many Ukrainian cities, including in Donetsk and Luhansk, but also the targeting of civilian energy and water infrastructure, reportedly by Russian forces. Recent reports of drone attacks in and around Odessa are also deeply disturbing, she said., To date, t the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has recorded 14,844 civilian casualties with 5,996 persons killed and 8,848 injured. Those are verified individual incidents; actual figures are likely considerably higher, she pointed out. Turning to nuclear security, she said alarming rhetoric regarding the use of nuclear weapons is unacceptable. She reiterated the Secretary-General's appeal for all nuclear‑armed States, including the Russian Federation, to recommit to the non-use and progressive elimination of nuclear weapons. Amid those grim developments, she said the United Nations continues to work to alleviate the suffering caused by the war, to support accountability for violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, and to prevent the deterioration of the already volatile situation around Ukraine’s nuclear sites. Regarding the delivery of assistance, she said that in the areas of Kharkiv region back under Ukrainian control, the United Nations and partner organizations were able to organize several aid convoys. However, in areas outside Government control in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia regions, access is the biggest challenge., The Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine continues to report on violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, she continued, voicing grave concern about allegations of violations committed in parts of northeastern Ukraine, including after the recovery of over 400 bodies from improvised graves in Izyum. OHCHR is working with local authorities to investigate this and other allegations of human rights violations and abuses in areas in Kharkiv region that were until recently under Russian control. Following investigations in the areas of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, mandated by the Human Rights Council, has concluded that war crimes were committed in Ukraine. Among other findings, the Commission was struck by the large number of executions and other violations carried out by Russian forces. In the four areas it covered, the Commission has processed two incidents of ill‑treatment against Russian Federation soldiers by Ukrainian forces. “Those responsible for the outrages being committed in Ukraine, wherever they sit, must be brought to account,” she said., Noting reports of continuing attacks, as recently as last week, in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, she affirmed the United Nations continued support of the efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). She further urged all concerned to provide maximum cooperation with the Agency, stressing that all attacks on nuclear facilities must end, and the purely civilian nature of such plants re-established. The Black Sea Grain Initiative continues to gather pace, she said, noting that over 4.5 million metric tons of foodstuff have been shipped from Ukrainian ports, including to the Horn of Africa, Yemen and Afghanistan. Noting efforts to remove remaining obstacles to the export of Russian food products and fertilizers also continue, she said these products are not under sanctions, and it is crucial to get them back to world markets. “Averting a global food crisis makes it vital to renew the Black Sea deal when it expires at the end of November,” she underscored. Reiterating the Secretary‑General's appeal, she urged Member States to help prevent further escalation, and to do all they can to end the war and ensure lasting peace in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law., Statements, VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, President of Ukraine, addressing the Security Council via a pre-recorded video statement, said “so far, [representatives of the Russian Federation] haven’t been using weapons instead of words in [the Security Council]”. Yet, no one would be surprised if the Security Council Chamber was turned into a zone of violence by the Russian representatives. Moscow despises the Charter of the United Nations, and it is only a matter of time before it destroys the last international institution that can still function. Moscow responds to any proposal for talks with new brutality on the battlefield, he asserted, pointing to hundreds of examples of its violations of the international legal order., On crises and threats to Ukraine and the rest of the world, he underscored that the Russian Federation has ignored IAEA calls for the immediate de-occupation of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and termination of any hostile action against nuclear facilities of Ukraine. “Deliberately keeping the world on the brink of a radiation disaster,” Moscow is engaging in nuclear blackmail while the threats of using nuclear weapons have become the narrative of Russian officials and propagandists, he said. Its inability to guarantee the safety of the world — even against the threat of using nuclear weapons — proves that Moscow has no right to possess nuclear weapons., He said that, in response to the Ukrainian peace formula he presented to the General Assembly during the high-level week, Moscow announced mobilization of more forces. The Russian Federation deliberately focuses its mobilization on the indigenous people in the territory it controls, recruiting as many men as possible from that population. Among all the ethnic groups of Ukrainian Crimea, seized by the Russian Federation in 2014, the male indigenous population received the most Russian draft notices. “This is a genocidal policy,” he warned. In front of the eyes of the entire world, Moscow is conduction the so-called sham referenda on the occupied territory of Ukraine. People are being forced to fill out papers while threatened with guns, “all for a nice TV cover”, he said. The results of the sham referenda have been prepared well in advanced, just as the issue of passports for the population of the occupied territory. Condemning the annexation of the captured territories — the most brutal violation of the Charter of the United Nations — as an attempt to steal the territory of another State and erase the norms of international law, he pointed to Moscow’s cynical efforts to mobilize the male population in Ukraine’s occupied territory into the Russian army and send them to fight against their own people., “There is only one way to stop it all,” he noted, calling for complete isolation of the Russian Federation. A State cannot remain a permanent member of the Security Council with a right to veto if such a State is waging a genocidal policy, keeping the world one step from a radiation disaster and threatening with nuclear strikes. To this end, he called for exclusion of the Russian Federation from all international organizations. He further urged for new and tough sanctions against Moscow. Any annexation in the modern world is a crime against all States that consider vital the inviolability of borders, he underlined, adding that Ukraine does not succumb to the blackmail of terrorists., In this ongoing war, not only Ukrainian independence is being defended, but also international law as such, he cautioned, urging the international community to support his country with all the necessary defence and financial support. Ukraine should receive clear and legally binding guarantees of collective security since its independence is of fundamental importance to global security. Moscow’s recognition of these sham referenda as normal, its implementation of the so-called Crimean scenario, as well as another attempt to annex the Ukrainian territory signifies that there is nothing to talk about with the President of the Russian Federation. “Annexation is the kind of move that puts him alone against the rest of humanity,” he added. To the international community, he said: “I believe in your ability to act.”, LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) said that, while seven months ago Member States were discussing how to preserve peace in Ukraine, “Putin chose war”, and thereby showed “exactly what he thought of this Council”. When leaders from around the world gathered in New York for the General Assembly’s high-level week, he announced a renewed conscription effort in the Russian Federation and instructed areas under Russian military control to prepare for illegitimate snap referenda. Moreover, his emissary threatened to use nuclear weapons — on a non‑nuclear country — to secure the illegitimate military gains of the Russian Federation. “The purpose of all of this is clear: Russia intends to try to annex these territories,” she added. First, it runs sham referenda in areas controlled by its military and its proxies, coercing people to “vote” at gunpoint, then it uses these referenda to lend a semblance of legitimacy to its attempted annexations. “We know the outcomes of these sham referenda were pre-determined in Moscow,” she continued, affirming that these actions do not represent a legitimate expression of the will of the Ukrainian people. The Ukrainian people demonstrated that they will never accept subjugation to the “Russian rule”. Furthermore, she underscored that the United States will never recognize any seized or annexed territory of Ukraine as anything other than a part of it. Her country will, thus, continue to provide “historic amounts of support for Ukraine”., She urged the States to “have the courage” to stand up for Ukraine, to call out aggression and attempts at “naked territorial expansion”. “Not doing so only enables Russia to commit further abuses,” she added. Spotlighting Ukraine’s fight for survival and democracy, she informed the Council that the United States intends to table a resolution, that will condemn the sham referenda. The document will call on Member States to refrain from recognizing any altered status of Ukraine and will obligate the Russian Federation to withdraw its troops from the country. She added that the sham referendum “will open a Pandora’s box” that will be difficult to close, as she called on the Member States to join her country in reaffirming the commitment to the Charter. “If Russia chooses to shield itself from accountability here in the Council, we will then look to the General Assembly to send an ‘unmistakable message to Moscow’,” she added., FERIT HOXHA (Albania), which requested the meeting along with the United States, quoting a 2014 speech by Russian President Vladimir V. Putin negating interest in the partition of Ukraine, implied that such remarks do not reflect the situation, just like Russian statements in the Council over the past months “have little or nothing to do with what happens on the ground — two parallel realities”. The Russian people are protesting against a war they do not want or understand. “When you vote at gunpoint the process is more expedited,” he said, describing the forced conditions in which the referenda are taking place in Kherson, with, among other things, votes being casted on park benches, shops or police stations, also known locally as “torture chambers”. Elsewhere, doors have been broken to facilitate the voting process. “So much for the solemn moment of voting,” he said. According to the already scripted result, residents would love to be ruled by the Russian invaders, he stated, emphasizing that “nobody in the world would take seriously the results of people voting at gunpoint”. “The sham referenda in Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson have nothing to do with democracy, free will of Ukrainians” or international standards, and follow a script seen in Georgia and Crimea. These are attempts to speedily legitimize conquests in front of the world, as Ukraine’s counter-offensive is pushing the Russian Federation out. The holding of such referenda violates the Constitution of Ukraine, Ukraine’s martial law, and also run contrary to the United Nations Charter, international law and the principles the Russian Federation should uphold as a permanent Security Council member., He strongly condemned that country’s war and its premeditated mock elections, which have zero credibility, stressing that Albania will not recognize them. Further, comparing this situation to other contexts is “worthless cynicism”. Therefore, he called on Member States to oppose the Russian Federation’s actions, condemn the referenda and anticipated results and never recognize any attempt to steal Ukrainian land through violence and terror. Noting that the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine established by the Human Rights Council concluded that war crimes had been committed in that country by the Russian Federation, and stressing the facts underlined by the International Criminal Court Prosecutor General, he said that “these crimes are being meticulously documented”. Urging support for a joint resolution to be presented by his delegation and the United States, he called on Member States to support Ukraine in defending itself and getting its territory back., FERGAL MYTHEN (Ireland) condemned the sham referenda conducted in the occupied Ukrainian territory “by Russia or its proxies”. He called the referenda “illegal and illegitimate” because they violate the Charter and the obligations of the Russian Federation under international law, including the law of occupation. They also ignore Ukraine’s Constitution, which provides a legal basis for any referenda that would affect the territorial boundaries of the country. Moreover, they “do not reflect the popular or freely expressed will of the Ukrainian people”, he stressed. Stemming from the military invasion, more than 1 million people from the occupied territories have been moved to the Russian Federation and over 7 million people were internally displaced. “These referenda are a cynical ploy to not only further undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, but also to try to reset an unjustified war,” he said, adding that they are “a blatant land grab to redefine areas of Ukraine as part of Russia”. Reiterating Ireland’s unwavering support for Ukraine, he stated that the sham referenda will not have any legal or political effect on the status of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant or other Ukrainian nuclear facilities. He condemned nuclear threats of the Russian Federation, and all nuclear threats “whether explicit or implicit regardless of circumstance”. He called on that country to end its aggression immediately, to comply with its obligations under international law, and withdraw all forces unconditionally from the sovereign territory of Ukraine., RUCHIRA KAMBOJ (India) said that her country had repeatedly called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and the need to resolve the ongoing conflict through dialogue and diplomacy, which Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi unequivocally stated to Russian President Putin on the side lines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in Tashkent. The global order is anchored on international law, United Nations Charter and respect for sovereignty and the territorial integrity of States. India will continue a human-centric approach to addressing the conflict, she said, adding that it is providing humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, as well as economic support to some of its neighbours in the Global South under economic distress, as these face the escalating costs of food, fuel and fertilizers due to the ongoing conflict. “The need of the hour is to end this conflict in Ukraine and return to the negotiating table,” she said, stressing the loss of countless lives and misery, particularly for women, children, and the elderly, with millions becoming homeless and seeking shelter in neighbouring countries. “Let us all work together to ensure that this comes to an early end,” she said., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana), expressing deep concern over the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine, stressed that the invasion undermines the Charter of the United Nations and stands in contrast to the norms which have guided international relations. Raising caution against heightening rhetoric concerning the use of nuclear weapons, “which can only lead into the dark abyss of a nuclear catastrophe with no winners”, he urged maximum restraint by all sides. Expressing particular concern over the ongoing referenda in the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, he stressed that such attempts are being made to disintegrate the legitimate authority of the Government of Ukraine. Stating that the international community “cannot continue to live in parallel universes”, he urged it to use the full weight of its will to serve as a bulwark against such practices. He called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, while also calling on the parties to refrain from targeting civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure. He urged Moscow to respect the sovereignty of Ukraine and withdraw its troops from the internationally recognized border. The situation reinforces the imperative for a reformed and responsive Council that can address all threats to international peace and security, he added., JAMES KARIUKI (United Kingdom) described the Russian Federation’s sham referenda in Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions as an egregious violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity. Reminding all of the Russian Federation’s referendum in Crimea, he noted the same playbook of disinformation, intimidation and fabrication. Since the invasion, the Russian Federation has controlled these regions through violence, torture, filtration and forced deportation. Any referenda held under such conditions, at the barrel of a gun and at three‑day’s notice in the middle of a war zone, can never be free or fair. In supporting the draft resolution and calling for the unequivocal rejection of the Russian Federation’s attempts to illegally annex Ukrainian territory, he warned there is no middle ground and stated: “No member of the United Nations should turn a blind eye to Russia tearing up the principles of the United Nations Charter. If we allow Russia to believe it can change sovereign borders by force, then the entire system on which we base our shared safety and security is under threat.” He urged the Russian Federation to end the senseless war instead of sending thousands of its citizens to their death and inflicting further destruction on Ukraine., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil) said the referenda in Ukraine are “yet another step that leads to an escalation of the conflict”, which are likely to make the prospect of peace negotiations even more distant. Turning to the right to self‑determination, he noted that in the context of decolonization, referenda were used to enable peoples to express their free will and Council resolutions established them as a legitimate practice to decide on issues of sovereignty and territorial integrity. The validity of referenda, however, depends on certain conditions, he said, pointing out that “it is unreasonable to assume that populations in areas in conflict can freely express their will”. Referenda on questions of sovereignty should be conducted in transparently, without restrictions on freedom of expression and allowing for monitoring by independent observers. He reiterated Brazil’s call for an immediate ceasefire and on starting peace negotiations. He called the Istanbul agreements in July and the recent prisoner exchanges “positive signs that demonstrate the value of diplomacy”, yet underscored, that these efforts were “insufficient”, calling for restraint and pragmatism. The Council so far has collectively failed to find creative solutions to the conflict. “Dialogue, advocated by most members in their interventions over the past seven months, presupposes a willingness to listen,” he added, stating that “the lives of those on the ground” should come before any political considerations., JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) said his Government is monitoring the reports on the referenda held in four regions of Ukraine. Citing General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), he noted that any attempt aimed at partial or total disruption of the national unity and the territorial integrity of a country is incompatible with the Charter's principles and purposes. Therefore, he urged all States to refrain from taking measures that subvert the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and any other country. He emphasized that any attempt to change borders by using threats and other means, incompatible with the purposes and principles of the United Nations, violates international law. Underscoring people’s right to self‑determination, he noted that this right cannot be understood as “authorizing or encouraging” any actions that impair, totally or in part, the territorial integrity of sovereign, independent States. He confirmed his country’s position in line with Assembly resolution 68/262 and reiterated a call for urgent dialogue between the parties of the conflict. To that end, he expressed the need to strengthen diplomatic channels to promote confidence-building measures and highlighted the importance of creating new “fora of mediation”, that could lead for a cessation of hostilities., ZHANG JUN (China) said his country will continue to play a constructive role in promoting peace and dialogue. He recalled that, in the recently concluded high-level general debate of the General Assembly, many leaders expressed concern about the prolongation of crisis in Ukraine and its spillover effects and called for dialogue to cease hostilities. Stressing that bloc confrontation and political isolation will only lead to a dead end, he said: “The task at hand is to push parties to open the door to political settlement as soon as possible and include their legitimate concerns in negotiations.” The signing of the Black Sea Grain initiative showed that, even in conflict situations, diplomacy can produce results and bring hope. International order based on international law must be upheld; they should not be mere political slogans. The Council should make full use of mediation tools provided for in the Charter and “stick to the right direction — that is ceasefire and peace talks”. His country will work with all peace-loving countries to deescalate the situation and resolve the crisis., MARTIN KIMANI (Kenya) said the referenda being held in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia will undermine the prospects of a longer‑term negotiated peace settlement as they will encourage strengthening of armed alliances in preparation for war. Even more alarming are the threats of the use of weapons of mass destruction. Kenya calls for an immediate stop to the hostilities and any attempt to unilaterally alter internationally recognized borders. Pointing to the most powerful actor’s prioritization of this conflict over other crises, he said that “bold action is required to halt extreme food insecurity and starvation in the world”. According to the World Food Programme (WFP), in Eastern Africa, fertilizer prices have doubled, fuel prices have risen sharply and cereal production is predicted to shrink 16 per cent this year. “It is a matter of life or death for all actors to respond to this food insecurity crisis,” he said. He called on grain and fertilizer producers to avoid stockpiling and breaking delivery contracts, and for sharply increasing agricultural productivity in the most food-insecure regions, particularly Africa, as this will prevent cycles of humanitarian crises. The multilateral system cannot continue as it is today, he said, urging real inclusion and fairness — starting with the procedural rules in the Council, all the way to the Charter. Reforms should not be limited to just allowing other major powers a seat at the table, he said, because multilateralism founded on the principle of “the powerful extracting what they can”, while “the weak suffer what they must” offers poor protection to the scourge of war., MOHAMED ABUSHAHAB (United Arab Emirates), noting that the referenda under way further complicate efforts for peace in Ukraine, underscored that any actions that undermine the prospects for a constructive dialogue must be avoided by all parties. Recalling the joint statement issued in January by the five permanent Council members, he affirmed that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Highlighting some incremental progress made between the parties that has led to positive outcomes — including prisoner exchanges assisted by Türkiye and Saudi Arabia, as well as the agreement related to the export of grains and fertilizers, he added that there is further potential to build on these agreements. With the war carried on for over seven months, he continued, more than 17 million people are now in need of humanitarian assistance. Nearly 14.5 million people were forced to flee their homes, 7 million of whom are now displaced across Europe, he went on. Spotlighting the importance of an immediate cessation of hostilities, he stressed that it is “essential to build on and amplify positive developments between the parties, so we can begin to pull back from this dangerous point of heightened global tensions”., MONA JUUL (Norway) rejected the recent referenda as “a phony pretext from the aggressor, Russia, to try to annex more parts of Ukraine”. They are contrary to international law, have no legal effect and do not change Ukraine’s sovereignty within its internationally recognized borders. No claim by the Russian Federation of territorial annexation, she continued, can take away Ukraine’s right to defend itself. In reminding all of their obligations under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, she expressed grave concern over the mobilization of reserve forces as a “dangerous escalation which will lead to increased suffering for people in all parts of Ukraine”. She then strongly condemned the war crimes the Russian Federation has committed in Ukraine and called for the perpetrators to be held accountable for the hostilities, indiscriminate attacks, ill-treatment, torture and sexual and gender-based violence. In expressing full backing of the Secretary-General’s good offices and the United Nations efforts to build and sustain peace, she pledged her country’s continued support for Ukraine. The Russian Federation must stop the war, she stressed, by fully, immediately and unconditionally withdrawing its forces and military equipment from Ukraine., EDWIGE KOUMBY MISSAMBO (Gabon) said that the international community will not stop its call for a de-escalation, pointing to the fact that most world leaders during the general debate advocated for negotiations to find a lasting solution in Ukraine. She called upon parties to refrain from fanning the flames and instead prioritize issues that guarantee peaceful coexistence, stating that the Charter must be the international community’s guiding document for respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity. While the humanitarian situation in Ukraine is worsening, and number of deaths are increasing, she appealed to all parties to lay down their weapons and stop with inflammatory rhetoric that might encourage the use of weapons of mass destruction. Gabon, she concluded, supports bilateral and multilateral initiatives aimed at dialogue and achieving lasting peace., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said that, over the next few days, the results of the referenda held in the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions will be published. It is a long-awaited event for the inhabitants of Donbas who have been living in constant fear for their lives and sought to bring peace to their land. For eight years, the shelling of the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics occurred every week. Meanwhile, the inhabitants of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia region can finally rest assured that they will not have their right to speak Russian or teach their children in Russian taken away from them., From 2014 onwards, Kyiv has deliberately focused on the physical destruction of the inhabitants of the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics while their backers — the European Union and the United States — did not lift a finger to force the Kyiv authorities to uphold the Minsk agreements, he said. Guaranteeing the safety of the citizens in those republics and their dignified future within Ukraine, the Minsk agreements provided for a ceasefire and direct dialogue between Kyiv and Donbass. If it had not been for the criminal violation of the Minsk agreements, violating inter alia Security Council resolution 2202 (2015), by the Kyiv authorities, with secret but clear support of the Western delegations, in other words, “if the West forced its subordinates in Kyiv to uphold the basic human rights and respect for their compatriots and their right to life”, Moscow’s special operation would not have been needed. The authorities in Ukraine clearly stated that Russians and Russian-speaking citizens of the regions were not humans, he recalled., In 2014, when the population of Crimea chose to become a part of the Russian Federation, Moscow heard similar accusations of aggression and annexation, he said. For the past eight years, people in Crimea have not lived in fear for their lives, he stressed, pointing to Moscow’s investments in the development of the region. Emphasizing that the recent referenda were conducted transparently with upholding all electoral norms, as witnessed by 100 independent observers from 40 countries who were surprised by the enthusiasm of the people of the Donetsk and Luhansk people's republics, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, he criticized the statement of the Western countries that they will not recognize the results of these referenda. “It seems they have to vote after they have been shot and raped, it that the case?”, asked the Russian delegate, opposing the Western propaganda and false narratives surrounding the referenda. Describing the direct vote of citizens as the criterion of democracy, he said the western version of democracy was born in a dictate of the liberal minority over the conservative majority. The denial of rights of non-liberals and non-Russophobes is not only used by Ukraine, but also their Western allies, he observed, drawing attention to countries “on the blacklist”: Italy, Hungary and Serbia., NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), Council President for September, speaking in his national capacity, said that, despite the Council’s seven-month-long appeals to end the war of aggression against Ukraine, Moscow has chosen escalation and further violation of the United Nations Charter and the international law. The partial mobilization announced on 21 September is evidence that the Russian Federation is “waging an illegal war in Ukraine, not a so-called special operation”. On the sham referenda in the occupied territories of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia, he cited President Emmanuel Macron who called them “a parody”. It’s the same “gambit” as was seen in Crimea in 2014, he said, with referenda used to legitimatize annexation of illegally occupied territory. He pointed to the Secretary-General’s remarks that any annexation of territory of a State by another State by threat of or use of force is a violation of the Charter and international law. France will never recognize the referenda, he stressed, calling on States to unequivocally reject them: “If we let Russia change internationally recognized borders of Ukraine by force, we’ll be letting them trample the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he added, affirming that “the fate of the occupied territories of Ukraine is of concern to us”. While Moscow is continuing its war, Kyiv is exercising its right to self‑defence, fighting in a counter-offensive that is succeeding, thanks to the courage of its people. Noting that tens of thousands are fleeing the Russian Federation to escape mobilization, he reiterated Paris’ support for Ukraine., Mr. HOXHA (Albania), taking the floor a second time, stressed that the “parallel” made by the delegation of the Russian Federation with Kosovo was wrong, inaccurate and regrettable. Kosovo and Serbia are bound today by dialogue. They meet; they do not fight. Moreover, the issue is not Kosovo nor any part of the world. It is the Russian Federation’s crimes and territorial grab, to the detriment of its neighbour. ""We will not be misled,” he underscored., Mr. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation), taking the floor a third time, said the statement just heard from the representative of Albania confirms the double standards that he had talked about regarding Kosovo. He said that he provided an example of how Western colleagues who dealt with Kosovo are calling for a completely different approach with respect to the Russian Federation and the referenda taking place in the territory discussed., For information media.

The data tracked direct deaths and injuries, damage to healthcare infrastructure and the impact on health, the destruction of residences, infrastructure, communication systems, and utility services – all of which disrupted the lives of Ukrainians., Results As of 4 August 2022, 5552 civilians were killed outright and 8513 injured in Ukraine as a result of Russian attacks. Local officials estimate as many as 24 328 people were also killed in mass atrocities, with Mariupol being the largest (n=22 000) such example. Aside from wide swaths of homes, schools, roads, and bridges destroyed, hospitals and health facilities from 21 cities across Ukraine came under attack. The disruption to water, gas, electricity, and internet services also extended to affect supplies of medications and other supplies owing to destroyed facilities or production that ceased due to the war. The data also show that Ukraine saw an increase in cases of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and Coronavirus (COVID-19)., Conclusions The 2022 Russia-Ukraine War not only resulted in deaths and injuries but also impacted the lives and safety of Ukrainians through destruction of healthcare facilities and disrupted delivery of healthcare and supplies. The war is an ongoing humanitarian crisis given the continuing destruction of infrastructure and services that directly impact the well-being of human lives. The devastation, trauma and human cost of war will impact generations of Ukrainians to come., Read the full report",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/human-toll-and-humanitarian-crisis-russia-ukraine-war-first-162-days

According to senior ZNPP operating staff, the cause of the blasts is currently unclear and is being investigated, the Agency experts added., This week’s shelling and explosions at the ZNPP site come after a few days without any such incidents. They show that the overall situation remains precarious and that immediate action is needed to reduce the risk of a major accident at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, now located in the middle of a war zone, Director General Grossi said., Last week in New York, the Director General began talks with Russia and Ukraine aimed at agreeing and implementing such a zone, and he told the IAEA General Conference yesterday that he was ready to continue consultations in both countries.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-106-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-27-sep-2022

Ukraine Arrival and Transit Monitoring (September 2022) [EN/UK],Assessment,REACH,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",23 Sep 2022,"Context & Methodology, Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, an estimated 6,975,000 persons remain internally displaced in Ukraine, and an additional 6,013,000 are estimated to have been displaced and returned to their place of habitual residence, as of 30 August 2022. In eastern Ukraine, an increase in hostilities and security concerns prompted a mandatory evacuation order for civilians within the Donetsk region on 30 July 2022, further impacting displacement. To inform the humanitarian response on the ongoing displacement in Ukraine, REACH conducted Round 3 of the Arrival and Transit Monitoring household survey between 25 July and 5 August 2022. REACH enumerators interviewed households (HHs) arriving and transiting through 9 IDP transit hubs across Ukraine: Lviv, Chernivtsi, Vinnytsia, Odesa, Kropyvnytskyi, Kryvyi Rih, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Pavlohrad. Interviews were conducted at transit centres, collective sites, administrative and humanitarian centres. In total, 2,797 household interviews were completed. REACH's survey does not capture all arrivals and transits at each transit hub, but rather a purposive sample of IDPs. Therefore, findings should be considered as indicative and whenever possible, data has been triangulated with secondary data sources. Lastly, page 12 presents an analysis on changes in IDP movements comparing REACH's Arrival and Transit Monitoring data collected in Rounds 1, 2, and 3 of the assessment, covering the period May-August 2022., Key Findings, A large proportion of assessed HHs originated from Donetska, Khersonska, Luhanska and Kharkivska. The most commonly reported push factors include security concerns in their settlement of origin., Most assessed HHs remained in Ukraine. Common destinations were the interview locations of Kropyvnytskyi, Odesa, Dnipro and Vinnytsia, indicating that HHs had settled in these locations. Pull factors included the presence of family/friends, perception of safety, and proximity to area of origin., Lviv and Zaporizhzhia reported the most recent arrivals, as transit locations for IDPs moving onward., In most locations, HHs depended on humanitarian aid and government social assistance. In Lviv, most HHs relied on employment income, whereas 42% of HHs in Zaporizhizha reported no income., 78% of assessed HHs reported that at least one HH member had a vulnerability, most commonly children (0-17 yrs) and older persons (65+ yrs)., From R1 to R3 of REACH data collection (late May to early August), moderate changes in IDP movements have occurred (p. 12), including an increase in IDPs leaving the Kherson area and a decrease in IDP returns.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-arrival-and-transit-monitoring-september-2022-enuk

UN Human Rights reports dire human rights situation seven months after the start of the Russian Federation wide-scale armed attack on Ukraine [EN/UK],News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,27 Sep 2022,"Kyiv, 27 September 2022– The ongoing armed attack by the Russian Federation against Ukraine has had a devastating impact on the enjoyment of human rights across the country. A new periodic report prepared by the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) highlights a wide range of violations of international human rights and international humanitarian law., These affect both civilians and combatants and include willful killings and numerous cases of arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance, torture and ill-treatment, and conflict-related sexual violence., “Hostilities continue to kill and injure civilians as well as destroy and damage civilian infrastructure. Attacks on civilian objects not only endanger the lives of civilians, but also leave them living in degrading conditions and undermine their rights to health, education, housing, food and water,” said Matilda Bogner, Head of HRMMU., From 24 February until 25 September HRMMU has recorded 5,996 civilian deaths and 8,848 injuries, including 382 children killed. The actual figures are much higher, as the collection and verification of information from several locations affected by hostilities remain severely hindered., The report states that 90% of civilian casualties were recorded in areas under Government control when the casualties occurred and 10% in parts of Luhansk and Donetsk regions controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. The majority of civilian casualties documented since 24 February were caused by the use of explosive weapons in populated areas., During the reporting period, HRMMU continued to corroborate the alleged killings of hundreds of civilians by Russian armed forces while they controlled settlements in Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv regions in February and March 2022. While most victims were men, they also included women and children., According to the report, enforced disappearances and the arbitrary detention of local authorities, journalists, civil society activists and other civilians were widespread in territory controlled by Russian armed forces or affiliated armed groups, with 407 cases (359 men, 47 women and 1 boy) recorded during the reporting period. Among those cases, 18 victims (17 men and 1 woman) were eventually found dead. The report also highlights 47 cases of arbitrary arrest and detention, as well as 31 cases that may amount to enforced disappearance (28 men and 3 women) attributable to Ukrainian law enforcement bodies. The victims were people suspected of supporting Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups., The report documents cases of torture and ill-treatment of civilian detainees by Russian armed forces. Out of 38 civilians released from detention (34 men and 4 women) and interviewed by HRMMU, 33 reported experiencing torture and ill-treatment while detained by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. The report also recorded 34 complaints of torture or ill-treatment in cases of arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance reportedly perpetrated by law enforcement bodies of Ukraine., “I stress that the prohibition of torture and arbitrary deprivation of life is absolute and applies in conflict and non-conflict settings to all persons, whether civilians or combatants. Perpetrators must be held accountable, and victims and their relatives must enjoy their rights to remedy and truth,” said Ms Bogner., During the reporting period, HRMMU documented the rape of 8 women and 1 girl, 15 cases of sexual violence used as a method of torture or ill-treatment against men, 11 cases of forced public stripping against both men and women considered to be ‘lawbreakers’ and 8 cases of other forms of sexual violence, such as forced nudity, unwanted sexual touching, sexual abuse and threats of sexual violence. Thirty cases were committed by members of Russian armed forces, 2 cases were committed by members of Ukrainian armed forces or law enforcement bodies and 11 cases were committed by civilians or members of territorial defense units. Since the reporting period ended, HRMMU has verified 13 additional cases of sexual violence., The report also covers the situation of prisoners of war. While during the reporting period, HRMMU enjoyed unimpeded access to places of internment for prisoners of war in territory controlled by the Government of Ukraine, it was not granted confidential access to any place of internment for prisoners of war in the Russian Federation or territory controlled by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. However, HRMMU found that in the vast majority of documented cases, Ukrainian prisoners of war were subjected to torture or cruel and degrading treatment by the detaining power. HRMMU also documented the death of two Ukrainian servicemen as a result of torture., “Such mistreatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war appears to be systematic, not only upon their capture, but also following their transfer to places of internment both in territory of Ukraine occupied by the Russian Federation and in the Russian Federation itself. This is a grave violation of international humanitarian law and the Russian Federation must address it,” Ms Bogner added., HRMMU also found that some Russian prisoners of war were subjected to torture and ill-treatment by members of the Ukrainian armed forces mostly during their capture or while in transit to places of internment., “There must be timely and effective investigations into all allegations of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law, including torture, ill-treatment, arbitrary detention and sexual violence. Regardless of their affiliation, perpetrators, including persons in positions of command, need to be duly prosecuted,” said Ms Bogner., The report also describes the so-called process of ‘filtration’ of civilians by Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups. HRMMU received numerous allegations that men and women who were perceived as having ties with Ukrainian armed forces or state institutions, or as having pro-Ukrainian or anti-Russian views, were subjected to arbitrary detention, torture, ill-treatment, and enforced disappearance., While the report welcomes the efforts of the Government of Ukraine to investigate and prosecute violations of international humanitarian law and of international human rights law perpetrated in the context of the ongoing armed attack by the Russian Federation, it also documents numerous fair trial violations. The report also finds that ‘courts’ in self-proclaimed ‘republics’ sentenced civilians for conflict-related crimes in proceedings that lacked transparency, independence and impartiality., According to the report, the hostilities have severely impacted the rights of people and groups in situations of vulnerability, including persons with disabilities and older persons, the majority of whom are women. HRMMU documented that in areas affected by hostilities, these groups lacked access to healthcare, adequate housing, heating, water and electricity., During the reporting period, 17 journalists and media workers, including bloggers, were killed. Ten of them were killed amidst active hostilities, while others were found dead in areas previously or currently controlled by Russian armed forces or affiliated armed groups. The report emphasizes that freedom of expression, including access to media, has been restricted in areas occupied by the Russian Federation or controlled by Russian armed forces or affiliated armed groups., “We are concerned that the shrinking civic space and highly restrictive environment in areas occupied by the Russian Federation deter people from reporting the human rights violations they have experienced or witnessed,” Ms Bogner said., The report notes a deterioration of freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol (“Crimea”), occupied by the Russian Federation since 2014. The Russian Federation continues to clamp down on freedom of expression by applying restrictive, vague and ill-defined legislation, penalizing a wide spectrum of real or perceived criticism of the Russian Federation or its armed forces. HRMMU has documented the prosecution of 89 individuals in Crimea for “public actions directed at discrediting the armed forces of the Russian Federation” since the legislation was introduced in March 2022., The report provides specific recommendations to the governments of the Russian Federation and Ukraine, as well as to the international community, and calls for their swift implementation to improve the human rights situation in the country, better protect civilians and strengthen accountability., “We will continue to document and report the facts on the ground and give a voice to victims. We consider this to be an essential part of seeking to prevent further violations and hold those responsible accountable for the violations already committed,” Ms Bogner concluded., HRMMU continues to seek first-hand information concerning international humanitarian law and human rights violations, and encourages victims and witnesses to contact:, E-mail: ohchr-HRMMUinfo@un.org HRMMU on Facebook: write to us on Facebook messenger Моніторингова місія ООН з прав людини / UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission HRMMU on Telegram: ohchr_hrmmu (only messages, calls disabled) HRMMU on Viber: +380503746708 (only messages, calls disabled), ENDS, The full text of the 34rd periodic report on the human rights situation in Ukraine (which covers the period from 1 February 2022 to 31 July 2022) is available in English, Ukrainian and Russian., Tanya Korol

OHCHR has verified numerous allegations of arbitrary deprivation of life, arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance, torture and ill-treatment, and conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV)., During the reporting period, OHCHR recorded a total of 12,649 civilian casualties, with 5,385 persons killed and 7,264 persons injured.

Piles of rubble and debris obscure the cartoon figures on the brightly painted walls. Notebooks and schoolbooks lie on the ground, pages fluttering in the wind., This is what a school yard hit affected by fighting in Ukraine looks like., As students of all ages return to the classroom this month, parents and headmasters must deal with the fact that thousands of schools have been damaged or destroyed across the country as a result of the international armed conflict, robbing children and teenagers of the safe space they need to learn and grow., “It is very hard because even before the war we had two years of the Covid-19 pandemic, and children studied online. We were concerned for the life and safety of the children,” says Irina Mykolaivna Voloshchenko, head of the Department of Education, Youth, and Sports of the Makariv Village Council., Voloshchenko and other teachers welcomed some students back on their first day of school on 1 September. But now teachers across the country must deal with the dangers of teaching during the armed conflict., “With groups of 20 to 25 children, how can you prepare them and quickly take them to a shelter when you don’t know how much time you have left until a missile or a bomb hits? It is very hard. Most importantly to children because they should receive high-quality learning services in appropriate, undamaged, modern schools and kindergartens,” Voloshchenko said., For areas like Makariv, Kyiv region, that were on the front lines in the springtime, many of the educational facilities that served the area were heavily damaged or destroyed. According to Irina, 17 of the 24 schools in the Makariv territorial Hromada have been damaged. In addition, six of the Hromada’s 12 kindergartens have been damaged and two destroyed., Since February 2022, hostilities in Ukraine have impacted the entire school-aged population – 5.7 million children aged 3 to 18 – due to the nation-wide closure of schools and other education facilities. UN OCHA estimates that 5 million children are in need of basic school infrastructure, especially in conflict-hit areas in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as in southern and northern parts of Ukraine. Children with disabilities are disproportionately affected. Education infrastructure has been badly impacted with over 2,100 facilities damaged and 270 destroyed to date, according to the Ukrainian Ministry of Education., Some schools in other areas of the country have been taken over by other realities of the armed conflict: many are now being used to host displaced families and cannot be used for teaching., Across areas affected by hostilities, we have helped repair dozens of schools and is providing blast film and tarpaulin to schools along or near frontlines as preventative measures. But the fact that we are doing this work underscores the horrific reality that parents now navigate, constantly questioning whether it is safe to send their children to school., While the new academic year just beginning, many schoolchildren have connected with their teachers online. Not all children or teachers have access to the IT devices or the connectivity that they need. To support continuity of education for students, we have been giving IT resources to schools and educators. We have also been giving cash to families to help them meet some of these needs., The ICRC delegation in Ukraine has been responding to needs in frontline communities since 2014. Since February 2022, it continues with activities including supporting repairs to damaged buildings, distribution of learning materials, Mental Health and Psychosocial Support for Teachers, Risk Awareness and Safe Behaviour training, and protection of education through humanitarian dialogue with the parties to the conflict., For further information, please contact:JenniferSparks (English), ICRC,+41 79 217 3200, jsparks@icrc.org, 00:00:00 --> 00:00:07, Iryna Mykolaivna Voloshchenko walking to a kindergarten, 00:00:07 --> 00:00:13, Iryna Mykolaivna Voloshchenko walking up the stairs, 00:00:13 --> 00:00:20, Iryna Mykolaivna Voloshchenko in front of the kindergarten, 00:00:20 --> 00:00:27, Iryna Mykolaivna Voloshchenko's hands while talking, Iryna Mykolaivna Voloshchenko: It’s such an emptiness.

"Director General Highlights Vast Work, Impact of IAEA at 66th General Conference Opening",News and Press Release,IAEA,"Disaster Management
Recovery and Reconstruction",26 Sep 2022,"The IAEA is addressing some of today's biggest global challenges, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told delegates at the opening of the Agency's 66th annual General Conference today., ""At the IAEA, we have the ability to mitigate some of these enormous challenges we are facing,"" Mr Grossi said. The IAEA and its Member States are harnessing the benefits of nuclear science and technology to better prepare for the next zoonotic disease outbreak; to mitigate and adapt to climate change; to improve food and water security; to fight cancer; and to clean up the ocean., The IAEA has also responded to emergencies with missions as different as those to Ukraine in efforts to prevent war from causing a nuclear accident and experts' visits to Latin America to assist Andean nations in preventing Fusarium Wilt from decimating their economically critical banana crops., Nuclear safety and security in Ukraine, Nuclear safety and security in Ukraine are top priorities for the IAEA. ""We must do everything in our power to prevent a nuclear accident that would add tragedy to the suffering,"" Mr Grossi said. Shelling has put into peril Europe's largest nuclear power plant -- Ukraine's Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) -- and repeatedly interrupted its external power supplies., Following a recent mission to the site, Mr Grossi proposed establishing a nuclear safety and security protection zone to ensure the physical integrity of the plant. The proposal has garnered strong international support. Last week, Mr Grossi met with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, as part of talks with all parties aimed at reaching an agreement on the zone's establishment. ""I am ready to continue consultations in both countries this week,"" Mr Grossi told the delegates at the General Conference today., The IAEA has established a permanent presence at ZNPP, and Mr Grossi particularly recognized the IAEA personnel on the ground., Energy and climate crisis, In his speech, Mr Grossi highlighted the role of nuclear energy in helping countries to meet their energy needs and in addressing the 'existential crisis' of climate change. Today the 430 nuclear power reactors operating in 32 countries supply about 10 per cent of the world's electricity and around a quarter of all low-carbon electricity. Furthermore, there are 57 reactors under construction in 18 countries, according to the IAEA's Power Reactor Information System (PRIS)., The IAEA has revised up its annual projections of the potential growth of nuclear power capacity to 2050. The climate crisis and the energy crisis have prompted more countries to look to nuclear power as part of the solution, Mr Grossi said. ""Many of you, especially from developing countries, are coming to us saying, 'We also want to benefit from this clean source of energy, in particular in its new manifestation through small modular reactors,"" he said. ""The Agency is going to help to build the capacities that you need and deserve."", Next month, the IAEA together with the United States, will host the International Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Power in the 21st Century, in Washington DC, from 26 to 28 October. It will offer a forum for government leaders, industry representatives, policy makers and experts from around the world to discuss the key challenges and opportunities nuclear power presents in the context of energy security and climate change. In November, the UN Climate Change Conference (COP27) will take place in Egypt, where the IAEA will host a nuclear pavilion., Atoms for peace and development, The Agency's work on nuclear applications has broad implications for societies, the environment and economies. Mr Grossi cited several examples. ""Many countries are working with us, increasing their capacities to fight cancer. We have the technology, we know how to do it, and we do it in close cooperation with WHO [World Health Organization],"" he said, referring to Rays of Hope, an initiative launched in February to help countries increase access to cancer care either by establishing or expanding their capabilities in this area., In the same spirit of cooperation, the IAEA is working with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations to address food security, Mr Grossi said. The Agency is assisting countries in using nuclear science and technology to increase resilience to the impacts of climate change, to improve sustainable management of land and water, and to reform food and farming systems. Food and agriculture remain a top priority for IAEA Member States. Together they accounted for almost a quarter of the IAEA's technical cooperation programme in 2021., The Agency is also leveraging its laboratories and known-how to address another major environmental challenge: plastic pollution. NUTEC Plastics (NUclear TEChnology for Controlling Plastic Pollution), another IAEA flagship initiative, has ""captured the imagination and will of many around the world"", Mr Grossi said. NUTEC Plastics helps countries harness environmentally friendly radiation techniques to recycle plastic and use isotopic tracing to better understand the problem of marine microplastic pollution., Nuclear non-proliferation, The IAEA has risen to the challenge of inspecting greater quantities of nuclear material and increasing numbers of facilities to assure the international community of their peaceful uses. ""We are known as the nuclear watchdog, and we take this task very seriously. We must prevent nuclear proliferation,"" Mr Grossi said. ""We must make sure that this blessing of nuclear energy for peace and development is not turned into an instrument of destruction and suffering."", Mr Grossi noted that the Agency's verification and monitoring of Iran's nuclear-related commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, have been seriously affected by Iran's decision to stop the implementation of those commitments, including the Additional Protocol., With regard to the NPT Safeguards Agreement, the Agency has made efforts to engage with Iran to resolve outstanding issues related to the presence of uranium particles of anthropogenic origin at three undeclared locations in Iran., ""We need to find common solutions for problems that are not going to go away if we don't solve them in a collaborative fashion,"" he said., With regards to naval nuclear propulsion, ""the IAEA must provide the necessary and indispensable technical answers to this issue, which is foreseen in the existing legal framework,"" Mr Grossi said. The Agency has its verification and non-proliferation mandate as its guiding principle, he added., Follow the General Conference, The week-long General Conference is the largest annual meeting of the Agency's 175 Member States. Returning to pre-COVID levels, many countries are represented at the ministerial level, and more than 2600 people are expected to attend the Conference throughout the week, roughly in line with the historical average number of attendees., General Conference sessions in the Plenary Hall, including the statements of officials and delegates, will be livestreamed for the public. Throughout the week, both the IAEA and its Member States will host about 80 side events, highlighting different aspects of the IAEA's work, from ongoing initiatives related to health and nuclear energy to available e-learning resources and the modernization of the Agency's laboratories at Seibersdorf., Follow the IAEA on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn for updates throughout the week: #IAEAGC for the General Conference and #Atoms4Health and #CancerCare4All for the Scientific Forum.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/director-general-highlights-vast-work-impact-iaea-66th-general-conference-opening

Water Sanitation Hygiene",31 Aug 2022,"Introduction, The sudden escalation of the war in Ukraine on 24 February 2022 has intensified the humanitarian crisis in the country. Among the primary issues of concern are nearly seven million people displaced within the country as of August 2022. 1 The scale of the displacement has led to questions about the impacts of population influx on host communities. In response, collective sites were established in different types of public and private buildings, including in many educational facilities (schools, kindergartens, university dormitories, etc). 2 The Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) cluster has currently mapped more than 7,000 collective sites across Ukraine. 3 According to the International Organisation for Migration's (IOM) General Population survey, approximately 4% of the displaced population resides in a collective center, while the majority live in private residences in the community. While there are indications that needs among the population in collective centers are higher than those in the general population, there is limited reliable data available to allow for representative comparisons between demographics such as host communities, displaced households living in collective sites, and those living out of collective sites. In addition, while many displaced households are located within the communities, little is known concerning their access to public services, in parallel with the humanitarian support they receive in and out of collective sites. Similarly, the scale-up of the response to involve national government, local civil society, and international humanitarian actors has led to questions around coordination between these various actors. In a recent study by ACAPS, it was found that challenges exist in distribution systems and coordination structures at different levels of the response.4 As of June 2022, there was limited information available at the subnational level on the coordination of response efforts to address displacement concerns. Dnipropetrovska oblast plays a key role in hosting displaced populations inside Ukraine. Official statistics in May reported the registration of 225,000 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), a number representing less than a third of the actual figure according to the regional council.5 According to the Organisation for Migration's (IOM) Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), this influx makes Dnipropetrovska oblast the host to the largest number of refugees in the country.6 Moreover, the crucial role of the oblast as an arrival transit hub is only expected to increase in the coming months as hostilities continue to escalate in the East and South of the country.7 In this context, REACH worked with the CCCM cluster to develop and implement an assessment on displacement dynamics and the humanitarian response in Dnipropetrovska to support the information needs of the cluster and other actors who work in the displacement response in the oblast. REACH and the cluster consulted with a wide range of additional stakeholders to gather input on the research design as well as interpretation of findings, including local authorities and local organisations., The purpose of the assessment and this report is to provide an overview of the needs and concerns of displaced populations in Dnipropetrovska Oblast, including a comparison of the needs and concerns with non-displaced populations, and an assessment of how these needs and concerns are currently being met by local response actors. To that end, REACH conducted:, A total of 1,304 household surveys (HHS) with displaced households (HHs) in collective sites and living in the community, and non-displaced households. Surveys were conducted through face-to-face interviews between 2nd and 17th July 2022. The sample was stratified by displacement status and geography to allow for a granular analysis of needs and concerns by these characteristics. Households were randomly selected in two-stages: In the first stage appropriate locations for each demographic were selected at random using randomly generated GPS points, or a prepared sample frame (e.g. CCCM master list of collective sites). In the second stage additional randomization techniques were applied to ensure respondent participation was random, such as approaching each fifth person to enter or leave a building. The survey instrument sought to capture key socio-economic indicators for each demographic, their needs and concerns, including issues of social cohesion, and movement intentions among displaced households., A mapping of local response actors (LRAs) working in the oblast including local non-government and civil society organisations, and individual volunteers between 22 and 30 June 2022. The mapping process involved a snowballing approach to compile a list of 53 LRAs, contacting one focal point for each organisation to participate in a short telephone survey (LRA-KIIs). The survey included questions on the size of the organisation, key activities and partner networks., Eight focus group discussions with local response actors (LRA-FGDs). The discussion guide of the FGDs explored perceptions on issues surrounding social cohesion, challenges in coordination and collaboration among actors, and risk mitigation. Participants were selected from contacts gathered through local authorities and the mapping exercise, ensuring they included actors in both urban and rural settings. This report seeks to draw together the findings from these sources to respond to the research questions, using a sequential triangulation approach., Key Findings, The stratified survey sample allows for a comparison of vulnerabilities, needs and levels of assistance between three types of households: displaced household living in collective sites, out of collective sites, and nondisplaced. Interviews and focus group discussions with public service providers, local response and economic actors shed additional light on the organisation of the current response and the current capacity to respond to those needs. Below are some of the key take-aways:, The international response remains more focused on Dnipro city compared to other parts of the oblast. IDP households in Dnipro city much more often reported receiving assistance from international organisations (53%) and UN agencies (59%), compared to their counterparts living outside of Dnipro city (33% and 41% respectively). Concerns that international assistance was not sufficiently reaching beneficiaries living in the periphery of the oblast were also raised by local response actors and regional authorities., Conflict-affected hromadas are in strong need of early recovery support to cope with the impact of shellings on infrastructure, energy and water facilities. Acute needs concern repair and construction work, provision of construction material, heating solutions, and energy and water provision alternatives., IDP households living in collective sites tend to be more vulnerable than IDP households out of collective sites, and non-displaced households. 54% of IDP households in collective sites reportedly include at least one pensioner, 32% have one chronically ill member, and 24% reported one member with disabilities. Importantly, data from REACH’s collective site monitoring (CSM) shows that 48% of assessed collective sites in Ukraine do not have an allocation plan for households with specific vulnerabilities., IDP households earned less income on average than non-displaced households before the conflict. In addition, they also reported suffering a greater loss of income since. This is particularly the case for displaced households in collective sites outside of Dnipro city; with 51% reportedly earning very low incomes (less than 5.000 UAH per month) since the start of the conflict, versus 20% of them before the conflict. By comparison, only 28% of non-displaced households outside of Dnipro city reported earning this level of income since the start of the conflict, versus 19% before the conflict., Most reported needs by households overall are economic assistance (54%), food (48%) and employment support (48%). IDP households reported additional needs such as long-term displacement solutions (43%), but overall non-displaced households reported similar needs, and sometimes an even larger proportion reported needs in essential areas such as healthcare (31% versus 24% for IDPs) and WASH (10%, versus 4% for IDPs). However, they were 11% to report not needing any assistance (versus 1% for IDP households)., Households living outside Dnipro City reported higher levels of needs than those living in Dnipro City. It is the case notably for economic assistance (61% for households living out of Dnipro City, versus 46% for households living in Dnipro City), and employment (39% for households living out of Dnipro City, versus 24% for households living in Dnipro City). Importantly, non-displaced households outside Dnipro city reported a need for economic assistance far more important than those residing in Dnipro city (60% versus 35%)., Non-displaced households are far less likely to benefit from humanitarian support (32% versus 91% for displaced households). For instance, the proportion of households reporting receiving financial assistance varies markedly (IDP in-site: 72%, IDP off-site: 68%; non-displaced: 19%) despite similar levels of needs reported. It may therefore be beneficial to further explore the degree to which, and under what conditions, non-displaced households are provided with humanitarian assistance., The main types of assistance providers, according to household recipients are; Public service providers (67%), volunteer initiatives (64%), UN organisations (51%), international organisations (44%) and local organisations (41%). IDP households in collective sites reported receiving assistance mostly from volunteer initiatives (73%), while those living out of collective sites most often reported receiving assistance from public service providers (69%). For non-displaced households, this was equal (69%), followed by local organisations (22%) and volunteers (13%)., Many local response actors appear to implement their activities independently, without engaging structures put in place by local authorities to supervise the response. This leads to a multiplicity of coordinating bodies and channels of communication, potentially raising difficulties for international actors looking to engage with unique interlocutors at the local level., Many collective sites may struggle to continue to house IDPs in winter, according to local response actors. Of particular concern are the utility fees for electricity and heating likely to rise significantly in the coming months. While government and municipal institutions receive compensation for the cost of utilities, many collective sites managed by local organisations do not. When costs rise, many may not be able to continue providing assistance., Only 9% of displaced household reported a clear intention to move again in the month following data collection (11% for displaced households in collective sites, 6% for displaced households out of collective sites). Of those (n = 76), 49% reported intention to return to their settlement of habitual residence, 39% to another settlement, and only 12% reported planning to move to another country., In conclusion, the findings reveal a concerning trend in the way current assistance in targeted. Households living in Dnipro City are much more likely to report receiving assistance from international respondents versus those living in areas outside Dnipro City. Likewise, displaced households are more likely to be targeted for assistance compared to non-displaced households, despite this latter group often reporting similar or in some cases even higher needs than the former. Findings do support the notion that IDP households living in collective sites tend to be characterised by additional vulnerabilities compared to IDP households living out of collective sites and non-displaced households., The approach of winter also raises new challenges. Local actors involved in the management of collective sites voiced concerns about their ability to continue to house IDPs. Of particular importance are the utility fees for electricity and heating which will rise significantly in the coming months. Considering the role of Dnipropetrovska oblast as a key arrival and transit hub is presumably going to increase as the conflict wears on, this issue is likely to grow more salient. Also of high priority is the need for early recovery support in conflict-affected hromadas, where numerous infrastructures need repair or heating solutions. It matters therefore that needs, and the capacity of local actors to meet those needs, continues to be monitored regularly and that additional assistance is made available and delivered to where it is most needed.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/area-based-assessment-dnipropetrovska-oblast-ukraine-august-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",26 Sep 2022,"Crisis History, In February 2022, the Russian Federation launched a massive invasion of the sovereign territory of Ukraine and since then millions of Ukrainians have been forced from their homes and are in need of humanitarian assistance, in what has become one of the largest and fastest displacement crises globally. Over 3.5 million people have become refugees and an estimated 6.5 million people have become internally displaced within Ukraine. A further 12 million people are estimated to be stranded or are unable to leave Ukraine due to increasing violence, destruction of bridges and roads, as well as lack of resources or information on where to find safety and accommodation. The people have become displaced and are in need of basic necessities such as food, water, shelter, medical care and heating., A total of 14 hospitals have been targeted according to the World Health Organsiation. Humanitarian green zones have been targeted and there have been indiscriminant attacks on civilians as they flee the conflict. Ensuring the health and well being of people is essential in humanitarian crises and conflicts. Casualties have been reported across the country and this is most likely to increase resulting in hospitals being overwhelmed due to the Internally Displaced People (IDPs) situation., There is poor or no access to primary health care institutions due to restricted mobility and security concerns, especially in areas of intense fighting. This disrupts the logistics chain as well as the referral system; thereby making primary and secondary and tertiary care (hospitals and specialist centers) inaccessible to the population. In particular, mental health and psychosocial support services, sexual, reproductive, and maternal health care, ante-natal care, child health, and assistance to people with disabilities are particularly difficult to access. Damage to health care infrastructure has derailed access to referral hospitals and pharmacies, and personnel fleeing from conflict-affected areas are compounding to paralyze the health system.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-country-program-overview

Responding to Ukraine’s Displacement Crisis: From Speed to Sustainability [EN/UK],Analysis,ICG,Humanitarian Financing,26 Sep 2022,"Some seven million people are displaced inside Ukraine, many of them with no home to return to. The grassroots effort organised to help them is not sustainable. Donors should keep channelling aid to civil society but lay the groundwork for the state to step in., What’s new? Tens of millions of Ukrainians have fled fighting since Russia invaded in February, in Europe’s largest movement of people since World War II. As the war rages on, local volunteer networks, aid organisations and the Ukrainian state are stretched thin trying to respond to the mounting humanitarian crisis., Why does it matter? Though Ukraine’s recent military advances might enable some of the displaced to go home, millions have nowhere to return to. Helping them is a serious challenge for Ukraine and its backers – one growing more urgent as people struggle to overcome trauma, get jobs and find shelter ahead of winter., What should be done? Speeding up the delivery of financial support to ease the humanitarian toll is vital to Ukraine’s survival. A long view and a finely calibrated division of labour among the state, local civil society and international organisations will be critical for what will be a decades-long effort to assist the displaced., I. Overview, Russia’s war in Ukraine has forcibly displaced people on a scale unprecedented in Europe since World War II. In addition to the millions of refugees who have left the country, some seven million people have fled combat zones for safer areas inside Ukraine. A sprawling grassroots network has organised to help them. Local governments and civil society groups, using donated money and goods, have worked to provide housing, food and medicine to those in need. The response’s ad hoc nature made it fast and flexible. But it is not sustainable. Nor is it easy to scale up for the long-term displacement crisis the country faces, for one thing because it poses challenges in ensuring accountability for flows of supplies. Donors and the international organisations they fund will need to make new arrangements that, while continuing to give civil society a prominent role, shift the burden onto the broader shoulders of the government., With millions of Ukrainians living in cramped apartments, dormitories and gymnasiums, out of work and unable to return to homes destroyed or now in Russian-occupied territory, the scale of need is staggering. How displaced people will weather the winter to come, amid rising prices and fuel shortages, is already worrying humanitarian workers. International agencies face huge challenges in getting aid to those most in need at a time when the global humanitarian system is reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic and food and energy price volatility, not to mention several other major wars, and when the collapse of Russian-Western relations looks set to deepen dismal trends in multilateral crisis management, complicating diplomacy aimed at helping the displaced and those living near the front lines as well as in Russian-occupied areas., In these circumstances, it is all the more important that the humanitarian response take a long-term approach, even while responding quickly to the emergency. Donors and international agencies should channel their assistance so that local civil society takes the lead now, but start laying the groundwork for government services to step in. Ukrainian authorities, civil society groups and foreign supporters should work together on more transparent rules for the incoming aid to clear up concerns about whether assistance is going to the people who need it most. A swifter, steadier flow of funds to the displaced would free recipients from dependence on charity and could eventually be a model for reconstruction when the war ends., II. Who is on the Move?, One third of Ukraine’s pre-invasion population of 41 million had to leave home during the first six months after Russia’s large-scale attack on 24 February. Some 7.3 million people fled the country, the biggest share of whom travelled through or stayed in Poland.1 Ukraine introduced martial law on the day of the invasion, prohibiting most men between the ages of eighteen and 60 from departing.2 As a consequence, more than 90 per cent of those who arrived in neighbouring countries were women and children.3 Among the internally displaced people (IDPs) as well, the majority, about two thirds, are women, as men face greater obstacles in travelling or seeking accommodation. Many men have also enlisted or stayed behind to guard property or hold on to jobs. More than half – 53 per cent – of IDP families have children, making child care and schooling a major concern.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/responding-ukraines-displacement-crisis-speed-sustainability-enuk
Russia/Ukraine: So-called referenda in the occupied territories are in blatant breach of international law,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,23 Sep 2022,"Reacting to news that “voting” has begun in the Russian-occupied areas of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions in Ukraine on whether to join the Russian Federation, Denis Krivosheev, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said:, “These so-called ‘referenda’ are a ruse for Russia to illegally annex occupied Ukrainian territory, which would be another escalation of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and further evidence of the Kremlin’s profound disregard for international law and the rights of people in the territories under its occupation. The Fourth Geneva Convention expressly prohibits annexation of occupied territory and other acts by the occupying power to deprive the occupied population of the protection of the Convention.”, “These so-called ‘referenda’ and any annexation by Russia that follows have no validity under international law, and, whatever Russia claims as a result, such actions will not change the legal status under international law of the territories Russia occupies., “Russia must respect its obligations as the occupying power under international humanitarian law and cease immediately all unlawful actions. It must also immediately end its aggression against Ukraine. All those responsible for crimes under international law, including war crimes, must face justice.”, Background, Earlier this week, Russian authorities and their proxies in the Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions in Ukraine, announced their intention to hold “referenda” on accession to the Russian Federation., On 23 September, representatives of the occupying authorities started making home visits to collect “ballots” from residents. The “referenda” are expected to take five days. Occupying Russian authorities have said that on the fifth and final day of the “referenda” on 27 September so-called polling stations would be open, but not before for security reasons., Any attempt by Russia to change the legal status of the territories it controls in Ukraine through occupation, including in the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions as well as Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, are a flagrant violation of the UN Charter, and a violation of the right of their population under international humanitarian law., Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states: “Protected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/russiaukraine-so-called-referenda-occupied-territories-are-blatant-breach-international-law

NEW YORK/BERLIN, It is our common responsibility to ensure that all children and youth have access to quality education.’ – Svenja Schulze, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany, Russia’s war in Ukraine has severely impacted access to education for approximately 7 million children. In response to that, the Government of Germany announced today €10 million in new, additional funding to Education Cannot Wait at the Global Citizen Festival., Germany is the largest donor to Education Cannot Wait, the United Nations global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises, with almost €330 million in total funding to date., “The international community urgently needs to increase its investments in education. Global Citizens, thank you for raising your voices to call for more support for Education Cannot Wait, so that all young people everywhere in the world will have access to quality education: this will enable us to end extreme poverty - now,"" stated Svenja Schulze, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Germany., “Thank you, Germany! Your inspiring leadership and strong support has taken Education Cannot Wait to the next level. Education is the most crucial investment to make today, to build a more equal, prosperous and peaceful future for all! Through global and local partnerships, we can deliver on our promise of quality education for crisis-affected children and youth, ensuring that no one is left behind,” said Yasmine Sherif, Director of Education Cannot Wait., The new contribution connects to Education Cannot Wait’s First Emergency Response grants in Ukraine. The current investments are managed by Save the Children and UNICEF and focus on protecting the wellbeing of Ukraine’s conflict-affected girls and boys, while also ensuring continuous access to education and psychosocial support., Schools across Ukraine have been the target of repeated attacks throughout the seven-month war. Recent government reports indicate that as many as 2,300 educational institutions had been hit, and over 280 have been destroyed. Millions of refugees have fled into neighboring countries, straining resources, ripping families apart, and denying children and adolescents to their inherent human right to 12 years of quality education., With the war in Ukraine, massive displacement in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, the compounding impacts of the climate crisis, and global economic uncertainty, the world is facing a worsening global education crisis., Shocking new analysis from ECW indicates that 222 million crisis-impacted girls and boys are in need of urgent education support – up from previous estimates of 75 million in 2016., In response to the global education crisis, ECW launched its Case for Investment and 2023-2026 Strategic Plan during this year’s United Nations General Assembly. To make good on promises outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (especially SDG4 – Education For All), Safe Schools Declaration and other international accords, the Fund is rallying donors and strategic partners to mobilize US$1.5 billion in funding to reach at least 20 million crisis-impacted children and adolescents over the next four years through its #222MillionDreams campaign., Education Cannot Wait’s High-Level Financing Conference will take place in Geneva in February 2023. Hosted by Switzerland and Education Cannot Wait – and co-convened by Germany, Niger, Norway and South Sudan – through the 222 Million Dreams campaign, the conference calls on government donors, private sector, foundations and high-net-worth individuals to turn commitments into action by making substantive funding contributions to ECW., Note to Editors, About Education Cannot Wait (ECW):, Education Cannot Wait (ECW) is the United Nations global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises. We support quality education outcomes for refugee, internally displaced and other crisis-affected girls and boys, so no one is left behind. ECW works through the multilateral system to both increase the speed of responses in crises and connect immediate relief and longer-term interventions through multi-year programming. ECW works in close partnership with governments, public and private donors, UN agencies, civil society organizations, and other humanitarian and development aid actors to increase efficiencies and end siloed responses. ECW urgently appeals to public and private sector donors for expanded support to reach even more vulnerable children and youth.

Protection and Human Rights",23 Sep 2022,"Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,, I would like to thank the Permanent Missions of Ukraine, Germany, Estonia, the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, as well as the Open Society Foundations for gathering us today to galvanize support for the strategic partnership between the Government of Ukraine and the United Nations to address conflict-related sexual violence., In May, I visited Kyiv and Lyiv, because I could not watch passively from my office in New York as harrowing testimonies of rape, gang-rape, and sexualized torture continued to surface. This visit resulted in the signing of a Framework of Cooperation with the Government of Ukraine, on behalf of the United Nations system. This follows the operational methodology of my mandate, which recognizes that we, as the United Nations, can support, but can never supplant, the primary responsibility of States to protect their populations. The Framework includes five critical areas of focus: firstly, ensuring that survivors and their children have access to comprehensive services; secondly, strengthening the rule of law and accountability; thirdly, building the capacity of the security and defense sector to prevent sexual violence; fourthly, ensuring that sexual violence is reflected in any ceasefire or peace agreement; and finally, addressing concerns related to conflict-driven trafficking in persons for the purpose of sexual exploitation., Positive steps have already been taken to translate these commitments into concrete action by the national authorities. In this regard, I would like to sincerely commend the leadership of Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration, H.E. Olga Stefanishyna, who, with the support of the Commissioner for Gender Equality, Ms. Levchenko, convened an Inter-Governmental Task Force, including the Ministries of Justice, Defense, Interior, Health, and Social Services, the Office of the Prosecutor General, and the Office of the Ombudsman, as part of a “whole-of-government” approach. Sub-working groups for each of the priority areas, co-chaired by my Office, were swiftly established, and included civil society representation. Through this consultative process, an implementation plan has been developed to guide action on each pillar of the Framework, in a holistic manner. The plan will ensure that the national capacity to investigate and prosecute allegations of wartime sexual violence is enhanced through coordination with first responders and the establishment of a specialized unit within the Office of the Prosecutor General. It will ensure that comprehensive services and effective referral pathways are in place; that security actors are trained to respect and enforce zero-tolerance policies; and measures are taken to mitigate the risk of human trafficking. This will remain a “living” document, in order to ensure agile programming that keeps pace with a fluid and fast-changing environment. I am also encouraged by the support received to date from the donor and diplomatic community, and would like to express my profound gratitude to Belgium, Denmark, the European Union, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States for their contributions, which will support the deployment of dedicated expertise to affected areas, and the provision of multi-sectoral services. Moving forward, our efforts will require sustained political resolve and resources equal to the scale of the challenge., Finally, the results of our efforts will be measured through the eyes of survivors and frontline civil society actors. I am confident that with sustained support, including from partners in this room, we can ensure that the lofty ideals of international law are felt in the lives of those affected and at risk.

Meanwhile, in the Russian Federation, the partial mobilization was announced on 21 September, and the so-called referendums on joining Russia were scheduled to take place between 23 and 27 September in the non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA) of Luhanska and Donetska oblasts, as well as in parts of Zaporizka and Khersonska oblast invaded after 24 February. At the same time, humanitarian access in the areas of Kharkivska oblast back under the Government of Ukraine’s control has notably improved, allowing humanitarian organizations to organize several aid convoys., The most-intensive fighting continued to take place in Donetska oblast, where nearly 100 civilian casualties were reported just over the three-day period (16, 17 and 18 September)– 47 in Government-controlled areas (GCA) of the oblast, including in Bakhmut, Kostiantynivka and Kramatorsk, and 51 in NGCA, including in the cities of Donetsk, Horlivka and Makiivka. More civilian buildings, such as houses and schools, were also reportedly damaged by shelling, including the Kramatorsk Hotel in the centre of the Government-controlled city. And on 19 September, shelling in the centre of Donetsk city and in two other settlements was reported to have resulted in the deaths of 10 people and injuries of 13 more., Still in eastern Ukraine, deadly shelling was reported in the newly accessible areas of Kharkivska oblast, including north of Kharkiv and along the international border with the Russian Federation. Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported that four healthcare workers were killed in shelling on 18 September while evacuating patients and residents of a psychiatric hospital in the village of Strilecha, located at the border with the Russian Federation. Before the shelling began, some 30 people had been reportedly evacuated, with 600 more waiting to be evacuated when the security situation permitted. Later, on 21 September, the Governor updated that all the patients and residents of a hospital were evacuated to Kharkiv, including with the support of the Ukrainian Red Cross Society. Separately, on 20 September, the Governor reported that two civilians had been killed and nine more, including four children, injured in Hrushivka, south-east of Kharkiv. And, also in the east, there were reports of renewed fighting and shelling in Luhanska oblast, such as on 19 September when seven civilians, including three children, were reported to have been killed in Krasnorichenske, just east of the borders with Kharkivska and Donetska oblasts., Hostilities continued to be reported elsewhere, also resulting in civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure – including energy infrastructure. Four civilians, including two children, were reported to have been killed on 16 September in Kherson, located in the NGCA of the southern Khersonska oblast. It was reported that missile strikes on 19 September in and around Government-controlled Zaporizhzhia, in the south-eastern Zaporizka oblast, caused damage that included electricity infrastructure and resulted in power disruptions., On 19 September it was reported that hostilities had affected one of Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants (NPPs), when operator Energoatom said that there had been a missile strike just 300 metres from the South Ukraine NPP in GCA of the southern Mykolaivska oblast. Meanwhile, regarding Zaporizhzhia NPP (ZNPP) in NGCA of Zaporizka oblast, on 15 September, the 35-nation Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) adopted a resolution highly critical of the ongoing presence of the Russian Federation Armed Forces and Russian authorities at the plant – and calling for “the competent Ukrainian authorities to regain full control over all nuclear facilities within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders, including ZNPP, to ensure their safe and secure operation.” In a separate update on 19 September, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossisaid the situation at ZNPP remained “fragile and precarious” while adding that “today’s explosion near the South Ukraine NPP all too clearly demonstrates the potential dangers also at other nuclear facilities in the country – any military action that threatens nuclear safety and security is unacceptable and must stop immediately.”Two days later, on 21 September, Energoatom reported that shelling had again directly impacted the Zaporizhzhia plant – damaging communication equipment and causing the emergency start-up of safety systems.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-21-sep-2022-enukru

Removing explosive remnants of war in Ukraine,News and Press Release,DRC,Mine Action,23 Sep 2022,"Accidents caused by unexploded ordnances have been frequent in east Ukraine since 2014 when the conflict in areas along the border with Russian Federation started, and since when DRC has worked with humanitarian mine action in the Donbas region and beyond. Several years on, and in the wake of the humanitarian crisis that has developed since February, threats from explosive remnants of war increase dramatically across the country turning residential areas, roads and other infrastructure, public spaces and vast stretches of farmland into minefields. Years of dangerous and costly efforts are lost – and many more lay ahead before safe and cleared land can be handed back to people in Ukraine., DRC’s humanitarian mine action teams move inch by inch through the terrain laid out for clearance in an area of north Ukraine not far from the border with Belarus and the Russian Federation. This time, it is one of the roads used by the Russian Federation armed forces to move convoys towards Kyiv in the early days of the offensive launched on 24 February 2022. Clearance is underway in this and other areas that are now littered with explosive remnants of war - much of it believed to be unexploded ordnances – along with military tanks and remains of vehicles left behind, posing a continued risk for the lives and livelihoods of civilians here., ‘We expect to also find anti-vehicle mines on this stretch. They can be left behind visible but more often hidden underground or covered by vegetation that makes them nearly impossible for people to detect before it is too late,’ tells Afrim Bardoniqi. He is one of DRC’s Humanitarian Mine Action Specialists deployed to the area and has worked with demining in Ukraine since 2019., The four-kilometer dirt road in Ichnia is the stretch now being scrutinised for clearance of unexploded ordnance and is a vital connection between villages here. It currently forces residents on a necessary detour of around 45 kilometers to avoid the dangerous path. Local farmers, preparing for harvesting of the sunflower fields, are facing new risks, but can also not afford to leave precious crops behind., ‘We work here as fast as we can and operate six days a week to make progress. Depending on what is being uncovered along the road, it may take months before the road is safe and reopened - and winter is already approaching,’ says Afrim Bardoniqi., Mine action in east Ukraine since 2014, Prior to 24 February 2022, DRC humanitarian mine action efforts were taking place only in the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, now occupied by Russian Federation forces. DRC was present there since 2014 working with integrated large-scale mine action programmes involving among other things clearance and risk education of local communities., ‘It is terrible to see how nearly all our mine clearance work in Donbas is lost and new areas are even more heavily mined and destroyed than ever before. We have been providing civilians in the east with specific trainings and knowledge on safe behavior in contaminated areas, and this is hopefully helping people who have stayed behind or who may be returning. But in many ways, we will have to start all over and on a much more difficult task,’ says Almedina Musić, DRC Humanitarian Disarmament and Peacebuilding Sector Advisor in Ukraine., Demining priorities, Vast parts of Ukraine’s territory are contaminated by explosive ordnance six months after war broke out - and with more being added by the day. While the scale of contamination is yet unknown, not least due to limited access to many areas, the UN-led Mince Action Sub-Cluster for Ukraine estimated by 31 August 2022 that mine action operators with State Emergency Service of Ukraine (SESU) have identified 18,115,584 m2 of contaminated land, completed actual clearance of 463,898 m2 and removed 265 explosive ordnance items., DRC has partnered with the State Emergency Services of Ukraine to support humanitarian mine action in the country that is growing to a scale that requires intensive and meticulous mapping and planning. The collaboration includes thorough analyses of areas that can be accessed by mine clearance teams and a prioritisation of areas that may be deemed most important to clear first., Humanitarian demining teams are right now looking at numerous factors around new levels and types of contamination, consideration related to risk, access, usage of the contaminated areas and their importance for local communities. Guidance is usually that the highest priority is given to residential neighborhoods, followed by access areas, infrastructure, agricultural land, and lastly forest areas., New threats unveiled daily, In Ichnia, the four-kilometer stretch of road currently being cleared by DRC, is an important road in the region as well as for the local community, but not least for farmers to reach agricultural land. It is a relatively small area, but one that could easily turn into a much larger mine action challenge for Afrim Bardoniqi and his teams there., ‘We have already found over 70 items – mostly projectiles of different caliber ranging from 30 to 125 calibres. There is likely much more, and many more surprises in terms of new types of munitions that need to be safely removed and eliminated.’, All areas are different and unpredictable. They vary from involving mines and traps laid out deliberately at strategic locations such as bridges, roadsides and access points, to unexploded ordnance and other remnants of war left behind and often requiring extensive battlefield clearance., Explosive Ordnance Risk education, Teaching civilians about the risks related to living in areas where warfare is, or has been active, constitutes a significant part of DRC humanitarian mine action efforts. In Ukraine, millions of people now live in areas that are dangerous due to both the obvious and visible objects, and the hidden unexploded ordnance., DRC risk education teams work through direct engagement with communities, schools or groups of residents who live in contaminated areas. Online risk education sessions and courses are developed and offered for free by DRC to all who have access to the internet and may be interested, and awareness campaigns are rolled out on social media, TV and radio to highlight risks, mitigation measures, along with contact details of the State Emergency Services of Ukraine, the authority to alert in case of suspicious findings. Despite the many interventions, the risk of accidents is as prevalent as ever causing frequent accidents in Ukraine., Mine victim assistance, 26-year-old Oleksii from Chernihiv close to the border with the Russian Federation, is one of many in Ukraine who have encountered explosive remnants of war. He was in a car that hit an anti-vehicle mine and severely injured both feet. It happened shortly after the war had started, close to his home, in the middle of the road, where the mine was dug down in the narrow grass-covered path dividing the lanes and where nobody had expected that an anti-vehicle landmine could be hiding in the soil., ‘The blast affected me the most and threw me out of the car,’ tells Oleksii. His feet are still swollen with multiple scars witnessing of pain and complicated surgery, but slowly he is learning to walk again and after five months he was able to get out of the wheelchair. Through DRC’s Victim Assistance programme, Oleksii received a cash grant to cover some of the cost of the surgery., Assistance to victims of incidents like the one that happened to Oleksii is part of DRC activities in Ukraine, offering a range of integrated assistance such as psycho-social counseling and support, legal aid, as well as possibilities to apply for skills training, and grants to strengthen economic recovery through new livelihoods opportunities., Harvesting time, Back in Ichnia the DRC demining teams are wrapping up from yet another long day under the scorching sun. They know that time is running out when winter sets in making mine clearance impossible for several months. Nearby are farmers preparing their machines to venture out in some of the many and almost endless fields of sunflower and wheat, where crops are ready and waiting to be harvested., ‘We have heard many and worrying accounts of incidents where farmers come across unexploded ordnance and mines. It’s a dangerous time for them right now. They cannot afford to just leave their crops to rot and lose their income and entire livelihoods. So, they of course feel that they have no other choice than to take the chance and hope for the best.’",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/removing-explosive-remnants-war-ukraine
"Update by the Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, at the 51st session of the Human Rights Council (23 September 2022) [EN/RU/UK]",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,23 Sep 2022,"Distinguished President,, Excellencies,, Together with Ms. Jasminka Džumhur and Mr. Pablo de Greiff, I will present an update on the progress of the work of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, in conformity with this Council’s resolution 49/1, adopted in March 2022., Last time the Commissioners were present at the Human Rights Council was in May this year. The Council then requested the Commission, in resolution S-34/1, to address events that took place in late February and March 2022 in the areas of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy, and to brief the Council on the progress of that inquiry as part of its oral update in September. Consequently, we have so far mainly focused on events in those four regions., Tomorrow will mark seven months since the outset of the hostilities in Ukraine. We are concerned by the suffering that the armed conflict in Ukraine has imposed on the civilian population. This is illustrated by the figures updated regularly by the OHCHR concerning deaths and injuries and by the UNHCR with respect to refugees and internally displaced persons. The recent discovery of yet additional graves illustrates the gravity of the situation., Allow me first to make some general remarks., The Commission has focused on events in view of their gravity, their significance in demonstrating patterns of alleged violations, and the possibility to gain access to victims, witnesses, and supporting documentation., It seeks to coordinate its efforts with the many entities carrying out investigations in order to avoid duplication and re-traumatization of victims., The security of victims is at the centre of our work, and we ensure a strict respect of the “do no harm” and confidentiality principles. We would like to express our deep appreciation to victims and witnesses who have shared their stories., The Commission, which is independent and impartial, has sought cooperation and dialogue with relevant Governments. We appreciate the access and cooperation extended to us by the Government of Ukraine. Our attempts to engage in a constructive dialogue with Russian Federation authorities have, regretfully, so far not been successful, but we will persist in our efforts., Distinguished President,, Excellencies,, I will now return to our investigations in the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Sumy. The Commission has visited 27 towns and settlements and has interviewed more than 150 victims and witnesses. We have inspected sites of destruction, graves, places of detention and torture, as well as weapon remnants, and consulted a large number of documents and reports. The Commission met with Government authorities, international organisations, civil society, and other relevant stakeholders., Based on the evidence gathered by the Commission, it has concluded that war crimes have been committed in Ukraine., The following is a sample of the findings and observations we have made thus far., Starting with the conduct of hostilities., Regarding the conduct of hostilities, the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas is a source of immense harm and suffering for civilians. We observed first-hand the damage that explosive weapons have caused to residential buildings and infrastructure, including schools and hospitals. In Kharkiv city, explosive weapons devastated entire areas of the city., We note that according to the Office of High Commissioner for Human Rights, most of the recorded deaths were caused by the use of such weapons. This devastation is one of the factors explaining why a third of the Ukrainian population has been forced to flee. One older woman, who fled as hostilities raged in Kharkiv area, told us: “I don’t live, I just exist; I have nothing left in my soul.”, Indiscriminate attacks, A number of the attacks we investigated had been carried out without distinguishing between civilians and combatants. This included some attacks with cluster munitions or multi-launch rocket systems and airstrikes in populated areas., As for violations against personal integrity, we were struck by the large number of executions in the areas that we visited. The Commission is currently investigating such deaths in 16 towns and settlements. We have received credible allegations regarding many more cases of executions, which we are documenting further., Common elements of such crimes include the prior detention of the victims as well as visible signs of executions on bodies, such as hands tied behind backs, gunshot wounds to the head, and slit throats., Witnesses provided us with consistent accounts of ill-treatment and torture, which were carried out during unlawful confinement. Some of the victims reported that after initial detention by Russian forces in Ukraine, they were transferred to the Russian Federation and held for weeks in prisons. Interlocutors described beatings, electric shocks, and forced nudity, as well as other types of violations in such detention facilities., After being reportedly transferred into detention in the Russian Federation, some victims have disappeared., As regard these four areas, we have processed two incidents of ill-treatment against Russian Federation soldiers by Ukrainian forces. While few in numbers, such cases continue to be the subject of our attention., Sexual and gender-based violence, Investigating cases related to sexual and gender-based violence present specific challenges. The Commission has found that some Russian Federation soldiers committed such crimes. These acts amounted to different types of violations of rights, including sexual violence, torture, and cruel and inhuman treatment. There are examples of cases where relatives were forced to witness the crimes. In the cases we have investigated, the age of victims of sexual and gendered-based violence ranged from four to 82 years., The Commission has documented cases in which children have been raped, tortured, and unlawfully confined. Children have also been killed and injured in indiscriminate attacks with explosive weapons. The exposure to repeated explosions, crimes, forced displacement and separation from family members deeply affected their well-being and mental health., Distinguished President,, Excellencies,, The Commission will continue its inquiry related to the four regions mentioned in the resolution of May 2022 and will gradually devote more of its resources to its general mandate in the first resolution, which is both geographically and thematically broader. Issues of interest will include filtration camps, alleged forced transfer of people, and the conditions under which expedited adoption of children are allegedly taking place., In this brief update we have concentrated mainly on violations against personal integrity. Depending on the availability of evidence, the Commission will seek to investigate other types of violations, including the destruction of civilian infrastructure; the appropriation or destruction of economic resources; violations of the right to food; and the legality of changes in local administration, which may have far-reaching consequences. In addition to making recommendations regarding criminal accountability, the Commission will, consistent with its victim-centered approach, make recommendations about other dimensions of accountability, to which victims also have rights., We look forward to further cooperation with all relevant actors to pursue the task entrusted to us by the Human Rights Council., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-chair-independent-international-commission-inquiry-ukraine-51st-session-human-rights-council-23-september-2022-enruuk

"Ukraine: Residential building damage assessment Irpin, Kyivska oblast, February-March 2022",Assessment,REACH,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",23 Sep 2022,"Context, Following the Russian invasion in Ukraine on the 24th of February, 2022, the suburbs in the northwest of Kyiv, Ukraine's capital city, were occupied and/or became battle grounds in late February. Through the end of March, hundreds of residential buildings were reportedly damaged, with various degrees of severity., Official estimates of damaged infrastructure (both residential and nonresidential structures) based on field inspections remain rather scarse. According to official estimates, 70-75% of Irpin's buildings had been damaged, with at least 115 having been completely destroyed. An alternative look on situation with infrastructure's damage was applied by United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT). They used high-resolution satellite imagery to assess a number of structures visually sustained damage or destruction.2 More than 1,000 buildings (28%) were revealed to be damaged; most of them correspond to rather 'severe damage' or 'total destruction' than to 'moderate or possible damage' category (Image 1 and 2)., An assessment based on remote sensing data (i.e., satellite imagery) can provide not only the estimates of damaged structures' number, but additional insights of economic loss and harm to social well-being. However, light damage (e.g., broken windows) cannot easily be detected by two-dimensional satellite images. Another reliable source for damage estimates can be the imagery acquired during drone surveys and accompanied with three-dimensional surface models. A recent assessment for Irpin3 revealed the substantial number of light damaged buildings and was a basis for the estimation of economic loss. Based on building construction prices, it reported the loss of 922 mln. USD and 48% of buildings being damaged.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-residential-building-damage-assessment-irpin-kyivska-oblast-february-march-2022

We support efforts to maintain a continued IAEA presence at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) in order to support Ukraine, and stand ready to support the nuclear safety, security and safeguards objectives of the IAEA mission, as needed., We emphasize that Russia’s seizure and militarization of the ZNPP is the root cause of the current threats in the field of nuclear safety and security. We recall that the heightened risks of a nuclear incident will remain dangerously high as long as Russia remains present on the site of ZNPP. The Russian Federation must immediately withdraw its troops from within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders and respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Should the Russian Federation conduct any sham referenda within occupied territories of Ukraine, we reiterate that these would have no legal and political effect, including on the status of the ZNPP., We welcome the Director General’s work to follow up on his visit of September 1st and the proposals contained in his report.

"Pointing to Dangerous Developments in Ukraine, Secretary-General Urges Cooperation with International Criminal Court, as Security Council Tackles Accountability",News and Press Release,UN SC,Protection and Human Rights,22 Sep 2022,"9135TH MEETING (AM), SC/15036, Pointing to dangerous and disturbing developments that portend more destruction in Ukraine, the Secretary-General of the United Nations called for full cooperation with the International Criminal Court in its investigation into alleged atrocities committed in that country, as high-level representatives of the Security Council and regional countries met to discuss accountability for the ongoing war., António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, stated that the Russian Federation’s war in Ukraine shows no sign of letting up, adding: “The idea of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, has become a subject of debate.” Reports presented by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) constitute “a catalogue of cruelty” and the latest accounts of burial sites in Izyum are “extremely disturbing”, he told the Council. Ending impunity for international crimes is fundamental, and in this, the International Criminal Court plays an important role, he stressed. With the Court’s Prosecutor opening an investigation into the situation in Ukraine, he called for full cooperation with the Court., “The most vulnerable are suffering most,” he went on to say. The situation will only get worse as winter approaches and energy supplies dwindle. On a global level, the conflict has driven millions into extreme poverty and hunger and reversed years of development progress. To that end, the United Nations has provided aid to nearly 13 million people in need. “There is only one way to end the suffering in Ukraine,” he underscored, “and that is by ending the war.” Affirming he would spare no effort for peace in line with international law and the Charter of the United Nations, he appealed to all Member States — especially those present — to redouble their efforts to prevent further escalation, end the war and ensure lasting peace., Karim Khan, Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court emphasized: “We must show that those who pick up a gun or load a missile do not benefit from impunity.” Rather, the rule of law can serve as an anchor for peace and security in Ukraine and in other places. Noting that 43 States parties referred the situation in that country to the Court between 25 February and 2 March, he said that this demonstrates not only the level of global concern, but also reflects the common understanding that the law has an important role to play. The process of collecting information and evidence and scrutinizing it based on international standards is essential to “piercing the fog of war”, exposing disinformation and getting to the truth, he said., Detailing his Office’s efforts towards this end, he said that — based on its work to date — there are reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the Court’s jurisdiction have been committed in Ukraine. “Justice is not political,” he stated. Rather, it is a vindication of the fundamental rights of all members of humanity and a demonstration that the promises made through the Rome Statute have meaning. As a starting point for building peace and security, there must be a unity of purpose in upholding these fundamental rights, he added, pledging to work with all States and the United Nations to deliver justice in Ukraine., In the ensuing debate, many Council members condemned the Russian Federation’s blatant violations of the United Nations Charter and international law, insisting that it be held accountable for atrocities committed in Bucha, Izyum and elsewhere. They also expressed concern over that country’s recent military mobilization and threatened use of nuclear weapons, while others urged that the diplomacy that made the Black Sea Initiative possible be harnessed to achieve peace., However, Sergey V. Lavrov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, pointed out that Kyiv’s many crimes remain unpunished, stressing that today’s discussion is an attempt to impose a narrative of Russian origin for the tragedy in Ukraine. The United States and its allies — with the participation of human rights institutions — are covering up these outrages based on the policy that “Zelenskyy might be a son of a bitch, but he’s our son of a bitch”. Noting that the International Criminal Court has not reacted to Kyiv’s crimes, he said that the Russian Federation has no confidence in the work of this body, and that “all of this shows that the decision to conduct the special military operation was inevitable”., Countering that, James Cleverly, Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development of the United Kingdom, said he had just “listened to a further instalment in Russia’s catalogue of lies”. Citing the mounting evidence of atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, he stressed that Moscow has tried to lay the blame on those who have rightly imposed sanctions on President Vladimir V. Putin’s regime. Recalling the Russian Federation’s February assurances to the Council that it would not invade its neighbour, he said that this is a war of conquest and President Putin’s desire to send even more young men and women into battle makes peace less likely., Michael Moussa Adamo, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon stressed that the Council’s reaction to the war in Ukraine cannot be a confrontation of insults, emphasizing his country’s opposition to outrageous rhetoric that compromises prospects for peace. Underscoring that war is not a state of lawlessness, he urged that the outpouring of solidarity — rightly reserved for the war in Ukraine — must also be offered to all victims of armed conflict and the fate of many Africans must not be forgotten. Because of their skin colour, many were denied the assistance they needed. “When many hearts are torn for the victims of the war in Ukraine, ours beat in time with theirs,” he said, stressing that humanity must also denounce discrimination so that double standards are no longer the rule., Reem al Hashimy, Minister of State for International Cooperation of the United Arab Emirates, noted that the world, in all its diversity, is concerned with the consequences of the war in Ukraine for the international system and on food and energy security. Urging dialogue, de-escalation and calm, she said that her country’s approach is drawn from its experience in the Middle East, where people have been battered by a relentless insistence on zero-sum hegemony and the pursuit of narrow self-interest. “This has left, and will only leave, destruction,” she reported., Ukrainians want peace, stressed Dmytro Kuleba, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine. However, the Russian Federation seeks only military solutions and uses its diplomats in the Council to whitewash its crimes. While that country may not care for the principles in the Charter, there are 192 other Member States that do. Detailing how veto power gives leaders the idea that they can act with impunity, he warned that, if the international community does not hold them accountable for their actions, every evil force in the world will follow their lead., Gabrielius Landsbergis, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Lithuania, also speaking for Estonia and Latvia declared: “If international organizations stand up for justice half as strong as Ukraine stands up for universal values”, then peace and justice will prevail. The international community must meet President Putin’s desperate sabre-rattling with calm and resolve. However, condemnation alone will not end these crimes. He therefore called on the Council to fear not action — but, rather, doubt and indifference — and reminded Member States that it is not only Moscow that must be held accountable. Belarus will be on the charge sheet, too., However, Vladimir Makei, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, took umbrage with that, recalling that his Government often spoke out about the dangers in the region. “Unfortunately, we were not heard.” The tragic result of this arrogant position is seen today in Ukraine, as no one took seriously Belarus’ warnings that the security of one State cannot be guaranteed by suppressing that of another. Belarus has worked extensively to end the conflict and has not sent a single soldier or piece of equipment to Ukraine, he stressed. Rather, Minsk is interested in creating the conditions necessary for peace. “Everything, sooner or later, ends at the negotiating table,” he added, urging for the former in this case., Nonetheless, Josep Borrell Fontelles, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, in its capacity as an observer, emphasized: “Morally and politically, Russia has already lost the war,” adding that the world will never recognize the announced sham referenda that only serve as prelude for illegal annexation. Underscoring that the core issue today is accountability, he said that this conflict is more than just a war in Europe — it is about deciding whether to protect weaker States from powerful ones; whether the global rule of law is more desirable than the law of the jungle; and whether sovereign States should yield their free choice to spheres of influence., Also speaking today was the Prime Minister of Norway, along with Ministers and high-level officials representing France, Mexico, United States, China, Albania, Ireland, India, Ghana, Brazil, Kenya, Czech Republic, Germany and Poland., The meeting began at 10:07 a.m. and ended at 1:10 p.m., Briefings, ANTÓNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, reported that the Russian Federation’s war in Ukraine shows no sign of letting up; rather, dangerous, disturbing developments represent further steps away from peace and towards an endless cycle of horror and bloodshed. “The idea of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, has become a subject of debate,” he added. Expressing concern over reports of plans to organize so-called referenda in areas of Ukraine currently not under Government control, he underscored that any annexation of a State’s territory by another State resulting from the threat or use of force is a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law., He went on to say that an average of five children are killed or injured every day, that almost every child in Ukraine “has been scarred by the nightmare of war” and that some 14 million people — the majority of them women and children — have been forced to flee. This situation will only get worse as winter approaches and energy supplies dwindle. On a global level, the conflict has supercharged a triple crisis of food, energy and finance, driving millions more people into extreme poverty and hunger and reversing years of development progress. “The most vulnerable are suffering most,” he stressed., For its part, he pointed out that the United Nations is working to “maximize every opportunity to alleviate suffering”, and together with its humanitarian partners on the ground, has provided aid to nearly 13 million people in need. It is critical humanitarian workers have safe, unhindered access to all those requiring assistance. Turning to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) — which has been documenting the unacceptable impact of this war on human rights — he said that the Office’s reports “are a catalogue of cruelty”. They document summary executions, sexual violence, torture and other inhumane, degrading treatment of civilians and prisoners of war., “The latest accounts of burial sites in Izyum are extremely disturbing,” he said, calling for thorough investigation of all allegations to ensure accountability. Ending impunity for international crimes is fundamental, and in this, the International Criminal Court plays an important role. Noting that the Court’s Prosecutor has opened an investigation into the situation in Ukraine, he underlined the need for full cooperation with the Court. He also pointed out that the Fact-Finding Mission he established following the tragic incident in Olenivka is ready to deploy once all necessary assurances have been received, stressing that the Mission must have safe, unfettered access to all relevant places, people and evidence., Spotlighting the concerning situation at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, he said that the presence of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at the plant is an important deterrent and underscored that all attacks on nuclear facilities must cease. “The world cannot afford a nuclear catastrophe,” he said. He then welcomed the recent exchange of 250 prisoners of war between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, expressing hope that the parties will build on this with further exchanges. He also welcomed the signing of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which has resulted in a sharp drop in global food prices. These food shipments must continue and increase so that commodity markets further stabilize, and further, all States must immediately remove all obstacles to the export of Russian fertilizer., “There is only one way to end the suffering in Ukraine,” he underscored, “and that is by ending the war”. Noting that he will continue to spare no effort for peace in line with international law and the Charter of the United Nations, he appealed to all Member States — especially those present — to redouble their efforts to prevent further escalation, end the war and ensure lasting peace., KARIM KHAN, Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, said that, at this critical moment, the international community must jointly demonstrate that the law is also on the front lines in this conflict, protecting the fundamental rights of children, women and men. Spotlighting the responsibilities in conflict and underlining that accountability is absolutely essential, he stressed that the leaders of the world needed to renew the pledge made at Nuremberg to remove the statute on war crimes. “We must show that those who pick up a gun or load a missile do not benefit from impunity,” he emphasized, adding that rule of law can truly serve as an anchor for peace and security in Ukraine and in other places., He went on to report that, between 25 February and 2 March, 43 State parties referred the situation in Ukraine to the Court. This signifies not only the level of global concern, but also reflects the common understanding that the law has an important role to play. Investigators were sent to the area to conduct forensic and painstaking work in order to separate truth from fiction. The largest‑ever field deployment took place in May this year. Through innovative partnerships with national authorities, private entities, international organizations and States, a new model is being built in which a coordinated, coherent approach to action is more effective, he noted., The process of accountability, of collecting information and evidence, of subjecting it to analysis and scrutinizing it in line with international standards, is essential to “piercing the fog of war”, exposing disinformation and getting to the truth, he continued. That is sole role of the Prosecutor’s Office, and it has no other agenda besides what it is tasked with by the Rome Statute. In that regard, he detailed his visit to Ukraine and the first-hand evidence he saw of crimes, including bodies laid behind the Church of Saint Andrew in Bucha, the profound destruction in the streets of Borodyanka and the sound of bombs being dropped — a daily occurrence for Ukrainian citizens. Further, evidence and information collected by the Office detailed the targeting of civilian buildings, including hospitals, as well as the transfer of populations from Ukraine, including significant numbers of children. Based on the work to date, there are reasonable grounds to believe that crimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court have been committed in Ukraine., “Justice is not political,” he stated. Rather, it is the vindication of the fundamental rights of all members of humanity and a demonstration that the promises made through the Charter of the United Nations and the Rome Statute have meaning. As a starting point for the process of building peace and security, there must be a unity of purpose in upholding these fundamental rights, including the right of those in fear of their lives to know the law is on their side; the right of the families of victims to find out what has happened to their loved ones; and the right of survivors to see justice done in accordance with the rule of law. He pledged his commitment to work with all States and the United Nations to deliver justice in Ukraine and to vindicate the rights of communities impacted by atrocities globally., Statements, CATHERINE COLONNA, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France and Council President for September, speaking in her national capacity, said that the aggression launched by the Russian Federation on a sovereign State constitutes a fundamental violation of the United Nations Charter. The peaceful resolution of disputes and the territorial integrity of States are principles to which all ascribe. However, in the situation in Ukraine, each was blatantly violated. War has been accompanied by atrocities and destruction of infrastructure. The Russian Federation must be held accountable for unspeakable crimes in Bucha, Izyum and elsewhere, she emphasized, affirming there is no peace without justice. Further, victims must receive recognition and reparation for their suffering, she said, adding that if everything is permissible in Ukraine, then it is permissible everywhere else. Justice is a political imperative to hold individuals accountable whether they ordered, committed or planned the acts involved., She also noted that 43 States, including France, have referred the case to the International Criminal Court — the first time this has occurred. The Court will act in complementarity with Ukrainian justice and other national jurisdictions of States present in Council. France is working with many partners to collect evidence and reliable information, including sending two teams of investigators to Ukraine for three months to help Ukrainian authorities reconstitute the facts. In the wake of events revealed in Izyum, her Government is sending another team in light of the Russian Federation’s propaganda and disinformation on the issue. The Court has itself noted abusive conduct, with populations in conquered territories subjected to terror, she pointed out, adding that the mission, duty and work of the Security Council is to return meaning to things. Quoting Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn that all must condemn the very idea that men can exercise violence against other men, she underscored that facts investigated by the Court could constitute crimes against humanity. Those guilty will be prosecuted, and families must remain certain that crimes will not be unpunished. What is at stake is international security, and the principles that unite all States, she said., Jonas Gahr Støre, Prime Minister of Norway, said that it is the responsibility of the international community, and in particular of the 15 nations in the Security Council, to deliver solutions to global challenges. However, the United Nations Charter, which defines a rules‑based international order, is currently under attack. Citing President Putin’s speech last Tuesday, and noting that Norway was an elected member of the Council, a European State, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member and a neighbour to the Russian Federation, stressed that there was no military threat against the Russian Federation. “There is no legitimate reason whatsoever to underpin a massive mobilization of Russian troops,” he added, noting that this escalation will only lead to increased suffering for Ukrainians and Russians alike., Urging the Russian Federation to abide by the order of the International Court of Justice and immediately suspend its military operations in Ukraine, he emphasized that the Russian Federation’s destructive behaviour is also hurting multilateral cooperation. He praised the Secretary-General for facilitating the Black Sea Grain Initiative. Stressing that millions of Ukrainians have fled their country, with thousands finding refuge in Norway, he expressed hope for their safe return to a rebuilt Ukraine. Denouncing the attacks on civilian targets and the use of heavy explosive weapons, he underscored the unspeakable horrors revealed in Bucha, Izyum and other areas under occupation. Further, he condemned the forcible transfer of civilians to the Russian Federation and Russian Federation-occupied territory, the use of sexual violence as a tactic of war, and potential referendums in the occupied regions of Ukraine., Human rights violations must be investigated, and accountability ensured through national or international criminal justice mechanisms, both to ensure justice for the victims, and to deter future violations, he continued. To this end, he welcomed the Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, established by the Human Rights Council and expressed support to the International Criminal Court. This war is a catastrophe for the world, but “it is also detrimental to Russia itself, our neighbour”, he added, underscoring that thousands of Russian soldiers have been sent to their deaths in an unnecessary and illegal war, and implying that the Russian people would have taken stands contrary to the conflict, if asked. “Preventing and ending acts of aggression is a direct responsibility of the Security Council,” he stressed, reiterating Norway’s determination to protect Ukraine’s right to self-defence and Norway’s right to support Ukraine., MARCELO EBRARD CASAUBÓN, Secretary for Foreign Affairs of Mexico, pointed out that, since the beginning of hostilities, his country has insisted on the need for a diplomatic solution and for responding to the humanitarian dimension of the crisis without subordinating it to political considerations. Humanitarian assistance continues to be an indispensable priority. Mexico has also supported mediation efforts, he noted, recalling that his country — together with Norway — drafted the presidential statement adopted by the Council on 6 May. While not enough, this has been the Council’s only public expression since the beginning of the conflict. Urging respect for international law, he stressed that accountability is a fundamental pillar of the multilateral system, the rule of law and sustainable peace. Therefore, those responsible for crimes in Ukraine must be brought to justice without pretext or precondition, and in this, the work of the International Criminal Court is essential., He went on to welcome the signing of the Black Sea Grain Initiative — which demonstrates that, even during war, dialogue and diplomacy are possible — along with the steps already taken to ensure the access of fertilizer to global markets. Noting the United Nations’ purpose and the Security Council’s mandate to prevent human suffering from war, he said that this can only be achieved through dialogue, diplomacy and building effective political channels. “Indifference is unacceptable,” he stressed, as is the Council’s inability to fulfil its responsibility. The reasons for the Council’s dysfunction are well-known and correcting this will require structural reform. Urging the international community to work towards peace, he outlined a proposal by the President of Mexico to bolster the Secretary-General’s mediation efforts by creating a caucus for dialogue and peace in Ukraine that includes Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pope Francis. “Resigning ourselves to war is simply to stand on the edge of the abyss,” he added., ANTONY J. BLINKEN, Secretary of State of the United States, highlighted the recent unity of Member States on the Russian Federation’s war on Ukraine. Big and small, North and South have spoken of the consequences of war and the need to end it. Even nations with close ties to Moscow have publicly expressed serious concerns. However, President Vladimir V. Putin has doubled down, not ending the war, but expanding it, calling up 300,000 additional troops. Rather than seeking a diplomatic solution, he has rendered it impossible, attempting to annex more territory through sham referenda. That he chose this week to do so shows his contempt for the United Nations, General Assembly and the international order. Defending Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity is about protecting the international order, and if the international community fails, it sends a message to aggressors everywhere that they can ignore that order as well., Observing that wherever the Russian Federation tide recedes “we discover the horror left in its wake”, he recalled his recent visit to Ukraine where he witnessed gaping holes left in residential buildings by Russian Federation shelling. Following the Russian Federation forces’ control of Izyum for six months, investigators discovered sites including one with 440 unmarked graves, with bodies showing signs of torture. He also cited President Putin’s statement that the President would not hesitate to use “all weapons systems available” — this despite the Russian Federation’s signing in January of the Council declaration that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Every member of the Council and every Member State of the United Nations must reject referenda, he stressed, adding that Putin’s invasion is also distracting the Council and the entire United Nations system from working on the climate crisis, famine and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Meanwhile, the Russian Federation blocked exports of grain and is lining Ukrainian wheat fields with landmines. No one chose this war — not Ukraine, United States nor other Member States, nor the Russian Federation mothers and fathers whose children are being sent to fight and die. Noting yesterday’s protests in Moscow and the chants of “Let our children live,” he stressed: “One man chose this war, one man can end it.”, WANG YI, Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, said that his country’s position on Ukraine has been consistent and clear. As President Xi Jinping pointed out, sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States and the Charter should be respected. Each State’s reasonable security concerns should be taken seriously and efforts to resolve the issue should be supported. Noting his country was following the humanitarian situation in Ukraine closely, he reported that it has given humanitarian support to Ukraine, as well as 15,000 tons of food assistance to developing countries to help tackle the food crisis. He also urged that dialogue and negotiations be engaged without preconditions and without presuming the outcome., De-escalation must be worked towards together in a constraint and constructive manner, he continued, adding his support for the positive role of IAEA, as there is “no room for trial and error” when it comes to the safety of nuclear facilities. There must also be efforts to ease the humanitarian situation to minimize suffering and casualties. In addition, spillover effects must be contained in order to keep the global energy market stable and facilitate grain exports from the Russian Federation and Ukraine. To that end, he highlighted the International World Food Security Cooperation Initiative. Moreover, he spoke out against arbitrary unilateral sanctions and cautioned against letting developing countries pay the price. The Council should uphold the principle of impartiality, prioritize mediation and work towards sustainable peace. The global community should work together to uphold the United Nations international system, in order to “prevent any form of hot war or the so-called new cold war”., OLTA XHAÇKA, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of Albania, said that the illegal war waged against Ukraine by the Russian Federation — a permanent member of the Security Council — is a blatant violation of the Charter, both in Albania’s judgment and in that of the entire world. “International law is the same and mandatory for all,” she stressed, while pointing out that the Russian Federation has chosen to openly, continuously ignore it. Member States have worked to strengthen and expand the reach of international law and multilateral cooperation — agreeing that no one can stand above the law — in the hopes that the world would never go back to the distant past. However, she emphasized that the Russian Federation’s attempts to conquer and annex parts of Ukrainian territory “are actions reminiscent of the dark days of fascism and Stalinism”. Reports and fact-finding missions from the ground have revealed the basic truth about the Russian Federation’s actions, which constitute criminal brutality against the civilian population., She went on to say that innocent men, women and children in Ukraine — and tens of thousands of Russian soldiers — have paid with their lives for Russian President Putin’s “war of choice”. Condemning the Russian Federation’s new military mobilization, organization of sham referenda and threatened use of weapons of mass destruction, she called on that country to completely, unconditionally withdraw its troops and materiel from the entire territory of Ukraine. She also urged the international community to help Ukraine defend itself and to hold the Russian Federation accountable for what it is doing in Ukraine, which will both provide justice and prevent future atrocities. “We all tried to prevent this conflict — we could not,” she noted, adding: “but we must not fail to hold Russia accountable.”, Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence of Ireland, said that last week he witnessed the loading of a cargo ship with 46,000 tons of grain departing from Odesa for Bangladesh. The export of grain from Ukrainian ports through the Black Sea Grain Initiative had reached 3 million tons, with plans by Ukraine and United Nations staff to export 4 million tons of grain a month. The Initiative was reached through dialogue and the systems and structures and norms and institutions painstakingly built over decades, he emphasized. In January leaders of the five nuclear‑weapon States, including the Russian Federation, committed to avoid military confrontations. “Yet, just six weeks later, Russia launched an unwarranted and illegal further invasion of Ukraine and yesterday, President Putin again issued threats to use nuclear weapons,” he said. Further, Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine is an attempt to change internationally recognized borders by the use of force and no sham referendum can change that basic fact. Yesterday, Ireland filed a declaration of intervention at the International Court of Justice and at the European Court of Human Rights in Ukraine’s case against the Russian Federation., “No one country, no matter how big or powerful, should have the ability to veto the application of international law, for its own aims,” he continued. Bucha, the mass graves in Izyum and other areas, the attacks on civilians and infrastructures, the impact of explosive weapons are not fabrications. This is why Ireland is seeking the wide endorsement by States of the Political Declaration on Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas, at a high-level adoption conference in Dublin in November, he said, urging the Russian Federation to cease all actions against the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and return control to Ukraine. Promoting accountability through international bodies and structures is a must: “This is not just about Ukraine. This is about the entirety of the UN membership,” he emphasized, adding that it is not acceptable for the world to be governed by force and not through dialogue. The Security Council must not accept this., SUBRAHMANYAM JAISHANKAR, Minister for External Affairs of India, said the Ukraine conflict is a matter of profound concern for the whole world, in particularly. Threats of future nuclear weapon use are particularly frightening, he added. In a globalized world, the consequences conflict, like food, fertilizer and fuel shortages, are felt everywhere — especially in the global South, he pointed out, adding he strongly advocated for an immediate stop to the hostilities and a return to dialogue and diplomacy. As Prime Minister Narenda Modi has said: “This cannot be an era of war,” he noted. Emphasizing that there can be no justification for violation of human rights or of international law, he called for objective and independent investigations into the situation in Ukraine., The Security Council must send an unambiguous and unequivocal message on this count, he continued. Politics should never ever provide cover to evade accountability or facilitate impunity. He voiced regret regarding the role the Council has played recently in facilitating impunity and providing cover to evade accountability for some of the world’s most dreaded terrorists. The 15-nation organ must send a message that is unambiguous and unequivocally against impunity in the larger pursuit of securing peace and justice. He also called the Council the “most powerful contemporary symbol of diplomacy”. It must now continue to live up to its purpose. International law, the Charter and the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty must be upheld without exception., MICHAEL MOUSSA ADAMO, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon, said the war in Ukraine challenges the international community on multiple levels, from victims who number in the thousands, the ruins of the devastation, as well as propaganda, disinformation and the nuclear threat. It further sends the shock wave of food insecurity on a global scale. The peoples of the world turn to this Council for an answer. Therefore, the reaction cannot be a confrontation of insults. Gabon, he stressed, stands against hate speech and outrageous rhetoric which compromises the prospects for peace. He noted the International Criminal Court’s investigations into the crimes committed by all parties in the war in Ukraine with a view to collecting evidence and responsibility concerning allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity., Justice must be pursued on allegations of mass killings, disappearances, forced displacements or deportations, in complete impartiality and in complete independence, he continued. His Government’s message is clear: war is not a state of lawlessness. Parties to conflicts must respect international conventions protecting civilians and civilian infrastructure. However, the outpouring of compassion, assistance and solidarity which is rightly reserved for the war in Ukraine must be offered to all victims of armed conflict. The international community must not forget the fate of many Africans, including young students, for whom the path of exile has all too often been sown with shame and humiliation. Because of their skin colour, many were denied the assistance they needed as much as those with whom they shared the same suffering, fear and distress. “When many hearts are torn for the victims of the war in Ukraine, ours beat in time with theirs,” he stated. However, when discrimination is added to the horror of war, humanity must also rise together to denounce it so that double standards are no longer the rule., SERGEY V. LAVROV, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, said that discussing impunity in today’s meeting is timely, because that term reflects what has been going on in Ukraine since 2014. It is at that time when national radical forces, open Russophobia and neo-Nazis came to power following an armed coup directly supported by Western countries. The Maidan crimes remain unpunished — as do those who perpetrated the 2014 tragedy in Odessa — and yet, today, there are attempts to impose a narrative of Russian origin for the tragedy in Ukraine. For many years now, there has been a mobilization of Ukraine’s adult population — including women — and despite declaring its commitment to the Minsk agreements, the authorities in Kyiv have blockaded the Donbas region and denied its people access to pensions, subsidies, education and basic civil rights. The Kyiv regime owes its impunity to its Western sponsors — namely, France, Germany and the United States — who ignored Kyiv’s threats to resolve the situation in Donbas by force. Further, Kyiv has excluded Russian language and literature from school curricula, and ethnic Russians are being subjected to intolerance. Ukraine has “become a completely totalitarian, Nazi-like State, where the norms of international humanitarian law are trampled upon”, he said, adding that — under the guise of combating Russian aggression — Ukraine persecutes dissidents and journalists., Stressing that Western States’ position of “pumping Ukraine with weapons” is designed to extend the war to weaken the Russian Federation, he said that this makes the West party to the conflict. Russian armed forces and the militias of Luhansk and Donetsk are being opposed by the military machine of the collective West and NATO is providing intelligence to Ukraine’s armed forces. Pointing out that Ukraine is shelling peaceful civilians in Donbas with Western weapons, he said that these outrages remain unpunished because the United States and their allies, with the participation of human rights institutes, are covering up Kyiv’s crimes based on the policy “Zelenskyy might be a son of a bitch, but he’s our son of a bitch”. There are many witnesses of Kyiv’s criminal activities; Russian law‑enforcement bodies — in cooperation with their colleagues from Donetsk and Luhansk — are investigating these cases thoroughly. All perpetrators — regardless of nationality — will be held accountable. In this vein, he urged the Secretary-General to demand that the Ukrainian authorities publish information about the individuals whose bodies were shown in Bucha, which would be “useful to get to the bottom of this episode”. Noting that the International Criminal Court has not reacted to the 2014 coup d’état, the tragedy in Odessa or shelling in Donetsk, he said that the Russian Federation has no confidence in the work of this body, and that “all of this shows that the decision to conduct the special military operation was inevitable”., JAMES CLEVERLY, Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development of the United Kingdom, noted that, every day, the devastating consequences of the Russian Federation’s invasion become clearer, with United Nations agencies confirming more than 14,000 civilian casualties so far, more than 17 million Ukrainians in humanitarian need, 7 million displaced inside Ukraine and more than 7 million refugees in Europe. Citing the mounting evidence of atrocities against civilians, including horrific acts of sexual violence, torture and forced deportation to the Russian Federation, he stressed that Moscow has tried to lay the blame on those who have rightly imposed sanctions on President Putin’s regime. “Let me be very clear,” he stressed, “we are not sanctioning food. It is Russia’s actions that are preventing food and fertilizer getting to developing countries.” Recalling that, in February, the Russian Federation’s representative assured the Council that the country had no intention of invading its neighbour — which turned out to be a lie — he stated he had just “listened to a further instalment in Russia’s catalogue of lies. Mr. Lavrov, we saw you then, and we see you now.”, Denouncing sham referenda on sovereign Ukrainian territory, he accused the Russian Federation delegate of planning to invent the outcome and annex territory. He cited the testimony of Ukrainians on the reality of the war, including Olena Yuzvak, her husband Oleh and their 22-year-old son Dmytro, who were abducted by Russian Federation forces from their home in Hostomel in March. The soldiers shot Oleh twice in the legs, before they were all blindfolded and bundled into an armoured personnel carrier, abducting the son. “I just want my boy back,” he quoted her. Adding that this is a war of annexation and a war of conquest, he said that President Putin now wants to send even more young men and women, making peace less likely. If Ukraine’s sovereignty and territory are not respected, no country is secure, he stressed, adding that Ukraine’s fight for freedom is the world’s fight for freedom., SHIRLEY AYORKOR BOTCHWEY, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration of Ghana, said the world has been united since the Council’s referral over Darfur in resolution 1593 (2005) that impunity anywhere poses serious threats to peace and security and the international legal order. No State, however powerful, should get a pass. That is why the Council must act urgently and in unity to end its paralysis and the war in Ukraine. The damage the situation has done to the Charter may be incalculable. She also expressed concern over horrifying and painful humanitarian threats accompanying the war — with some 14 million people, mostly women and children displaced and the reports of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence. Similarly, the risk of a nuclear episode, whether by accident or deliberate action, involving the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, calls for support for efforts by IAEA to avert a catastrophe. Citing atrocities and reports of war crimes, she stressed that the suffering in Ukraine is abhorrent and should not be dismissed as the mere consequence of war. To do so would be sanctioning impunity., Ghana does not and will not recognize any territory that is unilaterally and forcefully acquired or dismembered from a sovereign entity, she continued, calling on the Russian Federation to immediately and unconditionally cease its operations and withdraw its troops from the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine. The need for a genuine diplomatic pathway is urgent, as “the barrel of the gun does not provide it”. It only leads to needless loss of lives and destruction on both sides. While acknowledging some positive impact from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, she called for the continued and unrestricted shipment of grain to countries facing food insecurity and urged all stakeholders to reach agreement on export of Russian Federation fertilizer and crop products. In a week when the eyes of the world are on the Council, and millions around the world look to the United Nations for leadership and hope, a strong message must be sent that impunity will not be tolerated. Instead, “we will act, through concerted diplomacy, to end the war in Ukraine”, she said., CARLOS ALBERTO FRANCO FRANÇA, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Brazil, affirmed that the Council was the appropriate forum to seek a solution towards lasting peace. Detailing the effects of seven months of conflict in Ukraine and the tens of thousands of people, many of them innocent civilians, who had lost their lives, he voiced concern about the millions of refugees and internally displaced persons whose return to their homes is uncertain, and with winter approaching, face a possible humanitarian crisis. Highlighting the reports on serious human rights violations, particularly against vulnerable groups, women and children, he called for those responsible to be held accountable., It was urgent to engage the parties in dialogue in order to secure an immediate ceasefire and open negotiations for a peace agreement, he continued. The continuation of the hostilities was also jeopardizing the food and energy security of millions of families in other regions, especially in developing countries. The risks of escalation arising from the current dynamics of the conflict were simply too great, he emphasized, adding that only diplomacy will bring the prospect of viable solutions to conflicts between States. “It is not the time to accentuate divisions or isolate parties,” he underscored. Rather, the Council’s priority must be to create conditions for negotiations towards a peaceful solution., REEM AL HASHIMY, Minister of State for International Cooperation of the United Arab Emirates, said the outbreak of the war in Ukraine clearly generated different reactions across the international community. For some, it warned of a paralysed multilateral system; for others, concern over the rise of bygone existential threats; and those for whom the war presaged a return of historical polarization with all its portents for the world. Those disparities existed alongside a unified expression of fidelity to international law and a need to respect it. She underscored that her delegation will not deviate from its unequivocal call for all parties to the war to abide by international law — including international humanitarian law — to respect its limits. In this context, the reports of daily violations are a cause for grave concern, and she welcomed all ongoing efforts, including by United Nations agencies, to respond to the humanitarian situation while taking into account the unique impacts of the war on women and girls., While the immediate imperative is a cessation of hostilities, peace remains the ultimate goal — and its sustainability requires comprehensive reconciliation predicated on accountability and justice for the war’s victims, she continued. Urging dialogue, de-escalation and calm, she recalled that repeated deviations from the law, without consequence, normalize the practice and “create a race to the bottom”. She noted the world, in all its diversity, is concerned with the consequences of the war on the international system, food and energy security, and the risks of an escalating confrontation. Her country’s approach is the conclusion drawn from its experience in the Middle East, where people have been battered by a relentless insistence on zero-sum hegemony and the pursuit of narrow self-interest. “This has left, and will only leave, destruction,” she stressed., GEORGE ORINA, Director General at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Kenya, said that the obligation to respect the territorial integrity of all Member States will be further undermined if any action is taken to change the legal character of areas in eastern Ukraine. He expressed concern regarding the threats of weapons of mass destruction, as well as breaches of fundamental international law and human rights obligations. He urged all national authorities to subject their soldiers to severe disciplinary action for any abuses, especially on civilians and captured combatants and pursue prosecution. All parties must agree to investigate allegations of human rights violations, he added, calling for accountability. To this end, Kenya called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, to be replaced by a mediated agreement securing the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and taking into consideration the security concerns of all parties., Regarding the need for serious reforms of the Security Council, he cited President William Samoei Ruto’s speech in the General Assembly on 21 September, calling for the democratization of the Council, if its damaged legitimacy is not to be destroyed. Further, it was time that the Council heeded the voice of Africa through reform of its membership”. He therefore welcomed United States President Joseph R. Biden’s announcement, calling for an expansion of the body. “The workers of Africa need their livelihoods protected from the climate crisis. They need the many serious conflicts on the Security Council agenda solved and not relegated to the margins because of Ukraine,” he stressed, underscoring that only permanent membership by African States will safeguard such interests in the Council. The entire permanent membership must commit to embracing reforms, for it is the only way the people of the world will consider this institution legitimate enough to earn their regard and cooperation, he said, reiterating Kenya’s respect for Ukraine’s sovereignty and integrity., DMYTRO KULEBA, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, calling the Russian Federation’s war of aggression against Ukraine the most pressing threat to international peace and security in this century, said that, at this moment, bodies of innocent victims, including body parts of children, were being exhumed from at least 445 graves in Izyum. Recalling the moment when the Russian Federation attacked Ukraine in February, he said that, within 24 hours, tens of thousands of Ukrainians returned from abroad to defend their country, whereas, in that same 24 hours, thousands of Russians left their country hastily. The Russian Federation will bear full responsibility for its war of aggression and consequent war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Ukrainian investigators, in cooperation with the International Criminal Court and other supporting States, are collecting evidence of the Russian Federation’s crimes to ensure that justice will be served. This was not only for Ukraine, but also for the rest of the world, because “there will be no peace without justice”, he stressed. As such, he called for a special tribunal for the crime of aggression against Ukraine for President Putin and his entourage to be tried. The Ukrainians want peace, but the Russian Federation is only seeking military solutions and is using its diplomats here in the Council to lie and cover the crimes up., Calling into question how the Russian Federation obtained its permanent membership to the Council, he detailed how veto power gives leaders the idea that they can act with impunity. If the international community does not keep them accountable for their actions, every evil force in the world will follow their lead, he warned. The Russian Federation does not care for the principles in the Charter, but there are 192 other United Nations Member States that do. Further, that country has led the world into a multifaceted crisis and demonstrated that they are ready to leave millions of people around the world food insecure simply to achieve its imperialistic goals. “We must not allow Russia to continue playing hunger games with the world,” he emphasized, urging the international community to use all diplomatic and public pressure available to demand the Black Sea corridor to remain open and not give in to “energy blackmail”. However, even in these dire times, Ukraine sent humanitarian aid in the form of grain to Somalia and Ethiopia. Calling on all countries to stand with Ukraine — developed and developing nations alike — he emphasized: “We are all in the same boat”, protecting the Charter and achieving peace. He then introduced the Kyiv Security Compact designed to protect Ukraine until it is part of NATO and to be used as universal mechanism by other States to improve their regional and international security and protect their territorial integrity., JAN LIPAVSKÝ, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic, said his country hosts the highest number of Ukrainian refugees per capita: over 400,000. This was a result of the Russian Federation’s colonial, unprovoked and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine which sent a massive wave of the most vulnerable population abroad. That aggression is perhaps the most dangerous challenge to global peace in recent decades, and while today it is about Ukraine, tomorrow, it may be another country. In August 1968, his country, then Czechoslovakia, was invaded by Moscow-led troops. A crackdown on the so-called Prague Spring, it turned his country into an occupied colony. “Russia cannot trick the international community and steal again another State’s territory,” he emphasized. Ukraine has refused this slavery and is bravely fighting for a multilateral world where rules protect peace., Expressing horror at the atrocities committed by Russian Federation troops in Mariupol, Bucha, Irpin, Izyum and elsewhere, he further cited reports of so‑called “filtration camps” — with hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens deported to the Russian Federation, including children. There are also testimonies of sexual and gender-based crimes, used as a method of warfare. All must be investigated and perpetrators must be held accountable, he stressed, applauding the Secretary-General for launching the Fact-Finding Mission on events in Olenivka. More than 40 States, including his, have referred the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court, which opened its investigation in March. Calling for a special international tribunal to prosecute the crime of aggression committed by the Russian Federation, he noted Czech law enforcement agencies have launched criminal investigations of certain crimes, based on the principle of universal jurisdiction. The Council bears a global responsibility for peace and respect for international law, he added., ANNALENA BAERBOCK, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, citing Bucha, Mariupol and Izyum, said “when we talk about the horrors unfolding in Ukraine, we are not talking about abstract reports”, but children, women and men. Underscoring that the war is one the Russian Federation will not win, she called on Moscow to end it — to stop the suffering in Ukraine, stop sending more of its citizens to their deaths and stop the sham referendums. For many, this may seem like a regional, faraway war. However, if a permanent member of the Council is permitted to launch a war of aggression against its neighbour, what does this mean for the United Nations, she asked. Citing the Charter, she noted that all Members shall refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State. “We must not stand idly by, and we will not stand idly by,” she said., The United Nations and Türkiye partners brokered the grain deal, and the World Food Programme (WFP), also supported by Germany, is shipping grain to Yemen and to the Horn of Africa, she continued. IAEA is working to prevent a catastrophe at the Zaporizhzhia power plant. In contrast to the Russian Federation, “we stand up for our partners”, she pointed out, adding that the international community must not let Moscow impose its destructive agenda. The United Nations has a shared responsibility to live up to the vision laid down in the Charter: that States resolve conflicts peacefully, all human beings enjoy their rights and freedoms, and all stand up for one other in solidarity., ZBIGNIEW RAU, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, pointed out that, despite being a permanent member of the Security Council — which is tasked with international peace and security — the Russian Federation breached the most fundamental principle and attacked a fellow Member State, disregarding international humanitarian law and human rights law. Unable to break Ukraine’s military resistance, that country committed horrific atrocities against civilians as a basic tactic of its war, he said, recalling evidence of torture found in the mass graves in newly liberated Izyum. He emphasized his support for the investigations being done by Ukrainian prosecutors and other States and detailed his country’s cooperation with the International Criminal Court. He also noted that Poland was among the participating countries of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) that twice invoked the Moscow Mechanism., Further, Poland has opened a domestic criminal investigation into the Russian Federation’s war of aggression, as this is a crime under Polish law, he continued. His country has also helped to establish a joint investigation team under the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation framework. He also urged that initiatives put forward by Kyiv be considered, including a special tribunal for crimes of aggression committed against Ukraine and an international mechanism for compensation for damage caused by the Russian Federation. The people of Ukraine stood up for their country and their independence with bravery and determination. “Now, it is our turn to stand up for the principles that protect us all,” he said, adding that the Russian Federation must be held accountable for the invasion and all the crimes committed in the course of the aggression., GABRIELIUS LANDSBERGIS, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Lithuania, also speaking for Estonia and Latvia, said that, just a year ago, the Russian Federation was sowing lies and distrust. Now it is sowing chaos and death, becoming a synonym of insane brutality, State-run terrorism and genocide. By announcing mobilization, President Putin has waged the war against his own people — as fear, blackmail and manipulation are the very few weapons he has left. Calling on the international community to meet that leader’s desperate sabre‑rattling with calm and resolve, he stressed that condemnation alone will not end these crimes. It is imperative that international organizations use all of their resources to bring Putin to justice, with the establishment of a special tribunal. “If international organizations stand up for justice half as strong as Ukraine stands up for universal values, peace will prevail, justice will prevail,” he stated., Citing far-reaching consequences beyond Europe, he stressed that the worldwide shortage of food is due to the Russian Federation’s aggression against Ukraine and the blockade of it ports, not because of the internationally imposed sanctions. With the Moscow regime pressing the button of nuclear threats, knowing that the world is aware that consequences of the disaster in Zaporizhzhia may potentially be worse than Chernobyl or Fukushima, he urged the international community to demand from the unconditional withdrawal of its military from the area. “When we say Ukraine, we mean true courage and unbeatable resilience,” he stated, underscoring that the country is fighting for every United Nations principle. Calling on the Council to fear not action, but doubt and indifference, he recalled that there remains a chance to preserve peace and security by defending the rules-based international order — reminding Member States that it is not only Moscow that shall be held accountable, as Belarus will be on the charge sheet, too., VLADIMIR MAKEI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, said that the events on Ukraine’s territory are a tragedy, noting that his country knows first‑hand the cost of war. Such events did not come about suddenly, however. Rather, they resulted from Western countries systematically ignoring the security risks in the region and failing to account for the concerns of the countries involved for many years. Instead, massive sanctions pressure by the West has led to devastating consequences for the region, also significantly reducing Belarus’ margin to manoeuvre. His Government often spoke out about the dangers in the region, he said, but “unfortunately, we were not heard”. The tragic result of this arrogant position is seen today in Ukraine, as no one took seriously Belarus’ warnings that the security of one State cannot be guaranteed by supressing that of another. For its part, Belarus has been working to end the conflict and strengthen regional security, he said, pointing out that his country served as the platform for the Minsk agreements, held some 120 meetings between 2014 and 2019 to resolve the situation, and in 2014, even proposed concrete proposals to Poland following a question from that country’s then-Prime Minister about what could be done to ease tensions in Europe., Belarus held three rounds of peace negotiations this year, he continued, adding that it suggested from the beginning that Ukraine establish direct contact with the Russian Federation. However, Ukrainian officials declared Belarus a “hostile country” in December2021 — before the special military operation — despite the two countries being neighbours with good trade relations. Now, the fighting unfortunately continues, noting the “uncontrolled Western efforts to pump Ukraine with weapons”; promotion of the activities of Ukrainian ultranationalist formations; NATO concentrating its troops at the border of neighbouring countries; and statements labelling Belarus as an aggressor and party to the conflict. Belarus is not in favour of war, although it does have obligations to its allies. Further, Belarus has not sent a single soldier or piece of equipment to Ukraine, and all accusations made against it by the West are unfounded, he stressed. Rather, Minsk is interested in facilitating negotiations between the Russian Federation and Ukraine to create the necessary conditions for peace. “Everything, sooner or later, ends at the negotiating table,” he added, urging for the former in this case., JOSEP BORRELL FONTELLES, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, in its capacity as an observer, stated that the illegal, senseless and brutal war in Ukraine is a frontal attack on the Charter and the international rules-based order. Not only has the International Criminal Court ruled that the Russian Federation must halt, but large majorities of the General Assembly have adopted resolutions against the aggression, as well. “Morally and politically, Russia has already lost the war,” he said, adding that the world will never recognize the announced sham referenda that only prelude illegal annexation. While calling upon global leaders to send a clear and united signal that the use of weapons of mass destruction is always unacceptable, he pointed out that President Putin is continuing along a dangerous path of escalation. What is at stake is more than just the war in Europe; it is the protection of weaker States from powerful ones; global rule of law versus law of the jungle; and the free choice of sovereign States versus spheres of influence., More so, the Russian Federation is dragging the world into an economic recession and global food crisis, he continued. The European Union does what it can to counter this fallout and is supporting global food security with more than €7.7 billion until 2024. The European Union also has supported the Black Sea Grain Initiative, using their Solidarity Lanes to transport grains for those that need it most, which has, in turn, resulted in lowering global food prices. However, the core issue today is accountability, he noted. The victims of the Russian Federation’s aggression and unspeakable crimes deserve justice and reparation. The bloc is supporting the Court financially and technically — but the entire effort is the responsibility of the international community and the Council, as well. “We owe this not only to the victims — but also to the next generation, the future of Ukraine,” he said., For information media.

IAEA Proposal for Ukraine Nuclear Safety Zone Wins Support as Talks Begin on Its Establishment,News and Press Release,IAEA,Disaster Management,22 Sep 2022,"An IAEA proposal to establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) is receiving strong international support and detailed talks have now begun with Ukraine and Russia aimed at agreeing and implementing it as soon as possible, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said today after a series of high-level meetings in New York this week., In a sign of growing momentum for such a zone to protect Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, French President Emmanuel Macron yesterday hosted an event in New York to discuss the safety and security of civilian nuclear facilities in armed conflicts that was also attended by Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell as well as foreign ministers and senior officials from several other countries., After the meeting, chaired by President Macron and Director General Grossi, a statement was issued by nine countries welcoming this month’s IAEA Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhya (ISAMZ) and supporting the Agency’s efforts to maintain a continued presence there. It also welcomed the Director General’s work to follow up on his mission to the plant on 1 September as well as the proposals made in a report he issued soon thereafter, which include the recommendation for a nuclear safety and protection zone around the ZNPP., The statement was issued by senior representatives of the following countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Ukraine, and the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy., They also underscored the importance of the seven indispensable nuclear safety pillars outlined by the Director General early during the conflict in Ukraine., Thanking them for their strong backing, Director General Grossi said a nuclear safety and security protection zone must urgently be implemented around the ZNPP, which is held by Russian forces but operated by its Ukrainian staff. The Director General led an IAEA team of safety, security and safeguards experts to the ZNPP three weeks ago. Two ISAMZ members remain there, providing independent, technical observations and assessments and helping to stabilize the situation., Further underlining the need for such a zone, there has been renewed shelling at the ZNPP site this week, damaging electrical cables and temporarily forcing one of the six reactor units to rely on emergency diesel generators., “I’m extremely grateful for President Macron’s initiative to hold this important event on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, and I’m very encouraged by the broad support the IAEA’s proposal has received. I’m increasingly confident that the safety and security protection zone will become reality very soon. It is urgently needed. I will spare no effort to make it happen,” he said., While in New York, Director General Grossi separately also met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, as part of talks with all parties aimed at reaching an agreement soon on the zone’s establishment., The Director General first proposed such a zone in a report issued a few days after his mission to the ZNPP, saying shelling there over the past several weeks represented a “constant threat to nuclear safety and security with potential impact on critical safety functions that may lead to radiological consequences with great safety significance.” In the report, he said “shelling on site and in its vicinity should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities”. This required “agreement by all relevant parties to the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP”.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iaea-proposal-ukraine-nuclear-safety-zone-wins-support-talks-begin-its-establishment

Safety and Security",22 Sep 2022,"In a new joint submission to the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine (IICIU), four independent NGOs call on the Commission to investigate the ongoing attacks on hospitals and health workers in Ukraine perpetrated by Russian forces, which are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law., The four organizations – Ukrainian Healthcare Center (UHC), Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), eyeWitness to Atrocities, and Insecurity Insight – spotlight seven health facilities across Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Sumy that were subjected to particularly egregious and well-documented attacks during the first month of the full-scale invasion. Since February 24, 2022, the World Health Organization has reported more than 500 attacks on health care facilities, personnel, and transports, killing more than 200 people. During the period from March 1 to March 21, UHC reports that five to six health facilities were attacked each day., The organizations write:, “The evident pattern of violence against healthcare will continue to have severe negative implications for the safety, health and rights of Ukrainians for many years. We urge the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine to investigate these violations and ensure that attacks on hospitals and healthcare facilities comprise an important part of the Commission’s analysis into the events committed in the forementioned regions of Ukraine between late February and March 2022.”, The UN Human Rights Council formed the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine on March 4, 2022, comprised of three human rights experts working over an initial period of one year. The IICIU’s mandate is “to investigate all alleged violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, and related crimes in the context of the aggression against Ukraine by the Russian Federation, and to establish the facts, circumstances and root causes of any such violations and abuses,” as well as “to make recommendations, in particular on accountability measures, all with a view to ending impunity and ensuring accountability, including, as appropriate, individual criminal responsibility, and access to justice for victims,” among several other actions., All attacks on health care warrant investigation and accountability. In the joint submission, the four organizations highlight seven specific facilities that were violently attacked as a result of Russia’s full-scale invasion:, See the full submission for additional details and context about each attack. The submission relies on information gathered from a variety of sources, including open-source materials, site visits conducted by the UHC, local witness statements, remote interviews with Ukrainian civil society colleagues, and photo and video footage collected by the UHC with the “eyeWitness to Atrocities” app., The organizations also call on the Commission to investigate the gendered impacts of attacks on health, as the destruction of health facilities can lead to limited access to reproductive care, forced pregnancy, mental health issues, and barriers to preventative care and specialized services for women and girls, including for survivors of sexual or gender-based violence., The widespread and systematic nature of Russia’s assault on the health care system of Ukraine is an extension of the strategy it deployed to devastating effect in Syria and Chechnya. To date, there has been no accountability for these wanton violations of international law. Through its new joint submission, the four organizations call on the IICIU to include attacks on health care within its ongoing investigations and recommendations into broader human rights violations in Ukraine, and that such cases be prioritized for prosecution. The IICIU is expected to publish its first short report on the human rights situation in Ukraine on Friday, September 23. Each of the above incidents is elaborated in the new UHC report “Massive, Brutal, Deliberate: Attacks on Hospitals in the Russia-Ukraine War during the First Phase of the Invasion,” which offers further documentation and analysis of these and other attacks on hospitals and health care clinics.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",22 Sep 2022,"More than half a year has passed since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Whilst we have been helping people in eastern Ukraine since 2014, in February this year, our assistance changed. We immediately increased our team in Ukraine and expanded our operation to almost all the oblasts throughout the country. Since then, we have helped more than 400,000 people, our team on the ground has grown to 260 employees, and generous donors have contributed more than two billion Czech crowns (€80 million) to the Ukraine emergency appeal. We have provided €32,9 million worth of aid to the victims of the war since Russia invaded., CONTENTS, AID IN UKRAINE, AID IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, AID IN MOLDOVA, Over the past month, we have delivered bottled water and food kits to newly liberated Balakliia in Kharkiv oblast, only six days after the liberation of Izium, we delivered drinking water to the town and has managed to supply humanitarian aid to thousands of people in the Donetska oblast together with the U.N. convoy. Deliveries of water, food, and hygiene packages continue in other areas of the country. We continue to help those who have lost their homes or whose homes need repairs to prepare for winter., We have already helped tens of thousands of refugees in the Czech Republic. We provide social work in ten regions of the Czech Republic, we have been involved in the crisis related to the payment of humanitarian benefits, and we are still lending a helping hand through our Ukrainian helpline., Read the latest summary of our assistance in Ukraine and the Czech Republic over the past month., AID IN UKRAINE, Drinking water for tens of thousands of vulnerable people, €20,5 MILLION WORTH OF AID (distribution of material aid), This month, we delivered four truckloads of bottled water and 2,000 food kits to the newly liberated Balakliia in Kharkiv Oblast. This work was undertaken through a local partner organisation that helped us get aid to where the assistance is urgently needed. “On 16 September we delivered drinking water to recently liberated city of Izium. As a result, residents received 4,500 bottles of 6 litres each. People in Balakliia and Izium have spent more than half a year under occupation with limited access to basic services and suffering the horrors of war,” says Petr Drbohlav, Regional Director for Eastern Partnership and Balkans at People in Need. On September 6th, we, together with OCHA Ukraine, delivered a convoy of humanitarian assistance to support 5,000 residents of Chasiv Yar and neighbouring settlements in Donetsk Oblast. We distributed 40 tonnes of bottled drinking water, as there is no water supply in the area due to the fighting. We continue to assist the frontline communities in cooperation with our partners., ""We were on the way we heard an explosion. It was so scary! And my son-in-law bent over and covered my daughter and saved her. If he hadn't, Olia wouldn't be alive,"" Valentyna says., We continue to deliver humanitarian aid to other areas of Ukraine. Over the past month, we have provided food kits to 6,081 people, basic hygiene items to 10,293 people, and bottled water to 17,632 people in the Donetsk Oblast. In the Luhansk Oblast, 1,120 people received hygiene, and at least 924 people received food kits. Food and other essential aid are being distributed in cooperation with partner organisations in Sloviansk, Kurakhove, Bakhmut, Donetsk Oblast, and in Huliai Pole, Orikhiv and other settlements in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. We actively support populations living in the frontline settlements in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Nikopol, Zelenodolsk, and Apostolove. We have delivered construction materials for repairing damaged houses in Apostlove and Chaplyno., Since February, we have also helped the residents of the Kharkiv Oblast. We have provided food for 5,635 people in the last four weeks alone. Many people have had to flee directly from Kharkiv, including Valentyna. Valentyna, her husband, daughter, and son-in-law tried to escape the fighting and leave Kharkiv. ""We were on the way we heard an explosion. It was so scary! And my son-in-law bent over and covered my daughter and saved her. If he hadn't, Olia wouldn't be alive,"" Valentyna says., Now the family has found a safe place in Chuhuiv, but it is not impossible to create comfortable conditions in a new home without outside support. Therefore, with our partners, we are supporting people who have been forced to live in bomb shelters for weeks., Also, in Lviv Oblast, we have been providing hot meals for 500 people for three months in collective centres, and in the last month alone, families in these centres have received food kits that will support 3,000 people. Across Ukraine, we are helping people who have lost their homes or have houses without windows or roofs to prepare for winter. The most recent assistance was in Sumy Oblast, where we provided tarpaulins and other materials for 1,321 people., Psychological support to people in collective centres, €93 THOUSAND WORTH OF AID (psychosocial assistance), Collective centres still provide at least a temporary home for hundreds of internally displaced people. These people have nowhere to return to and have spent several months in the centres. In addition to warm food and facilities, we provide children and adults with psychosocial and mental health support., We have also built child-friendly spaces in many centres. Here children can again feel unworried and forget about growing up in a war. We aim to make the centres as pleasant as possible for the children, so we buy equipment such as TVs, toys and puzzles, pencils, brushes and paints, books, but also tea, biscuits, and so on., Where the shops are open, we also help families with a financial contribution, €8,6 MILLION WORTH OF AID (financial aid to people), Where trade and markets work, we provide direct financial assistance; this means people can plan their shopping and buy precisely. This aid allows them to get what they need; they are not dependent on the contents of standardised food kits. In a situation where war has deprived people of almost everything, the opportunity to buy what a person needs is also an opportunity to exercise one's agency and make decisions about something in life. The most vulnerable families receive the equivalent of CZK 1,700 in hryvnia (68 EUR) every month for a quarter of a year so that they can buy goods according to their own needs., AID IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC, €3,08 MILLION WORTH OF AID, In the Czech Republic, we have helped tens of thousands of refugees thanks to the SOS Ukraine emergency appeal and in cooperation with partner organisations. We direct our support to those most in need—people with health or psychological problems or other specific needs. We help mothers of physically or mentally disabled children or women caring for the elderly and infirm., Our field teams continue to provide social work and counselling in ten regions of the Czech Republic. We organise or coordinate help centres for refugees. We create opportunities that give rise to various self-help groups. In Klatovy, for example, the chance to meet compatriots for a cup of coffee grew into the activities of the Women's Ukrainian Circle, which started cooking together and offering its catering at festivals., We are constantly seeking to improve our existing services. For example, psychological aid workers in the Karlovy Vary region will soon be trained in a unique method of responding to trauma. As part of psychosocial assistance, we also provide individual assistance to children who, for various reasons, cannot cope with the language barrier., We continue to monitor the situation in the hostels and address acute needs such as unpaid humanitarian benefits, finding housing, employment, accompanying and communicating with various institutions, helping with filling in forms, mediating health care, etc., We are supporting the project for the construction of modular social housing in the town of Pečky, which, once completed, should serve mainly to accommodate people displaced from Ukraine. Pečky is a pilot project of the Home for Everyone platform, which has the ambition to become a solution to the insufficient housing capacity in other towns and cities in the Czech Republic., We have been involved in solving the crisis related to the payment of humanitarian benefits, We are drawing attention to situations that require immediate solutions—for example, the overload of labour offices. In cooperation with other NGOs, a large number of volunteers and interpreters, we also supported the overwhelmed office in Holešovice, Prague., Our cooperation with the Consortium of NGOs working with migrants continues. We are meeting regularly with the management of the National Assistance Centre for Ukrainians. We continue to engage in crisis management and coordination of regional assistance centres. In the future, we will focus more intensively on Ukrainian teenagers aged 15 to 18, most of whom did not get into any Czech high school., We are supporting the provision of psychological intervention and material assistance to mothers, To meet the objectives of the SOS Ukraine emergency appeal, we have so far entered into partnerships and cooperation with 122 organisations. We continue to cover the assistance provided by the Hlavák Initiative at Prague's Main Station to arriving refugees., ""We have supported direct material assistance directed to mothers with children in Prague. We have entered into additional partnerships with organisations providing psychological assistance to Ukrainian refugees. For example, this assistance could be provided in crisis situations of endless queues at the Labour Office in the Prague Market Hall in Holešovice. We have helped to secure the activities of organisations focused on children's education or where they help refugees find work,"" says Zuzana Ramajzlová, head of the SOS Ukraine programme in the Czech Republic., We continue to cover the assistance provided by the Hlavák Initiative at Prague's Main Station to arriving refugees., On our Ukraine helpline, we are still looking for accommodation, answering questions about school attendance, and advising on the application for humanitarian benefits, The Ukrainian helpline team (770 600 800) is available to Ukrainians across the country on weekdays. With the start of the school year, the number of enquiries regarding school attendance obligations has increased. People are also contacting us concerning changes to the humanitarian benefit application process. And we are still dealing with housing difficulties or emergency accommodation., We have opened an online course for Ukrainian teaching assistants and a new ""branch for all"", With the growing number of Ukrainian children in Czech primary schools, we have individual and group tutoring. At the same time, we are recruiting volunteers from all over the Czech Republic. We are opening a new online tool ""branch for all"". This online tool focuses on Czech language tutoring and supporting children's adaptation to their new environment. Online we will also help families to navigate the education system and understand their options., In some locations, we are preparing leisure activities and specific support for children; we are continuing with adaptation groups for children; we have prepared a short video with an important message for all Czech children and teachers; finally, we are drawing attention to the fact that Ukrainian classmates do not have to be cheerful right away and that they should be given more time., We have completed and published an online Czech language course, ""Teach me"", for Ukrainian teaching assistants working in Czech schools; more than 1,100 people have signed up so far., AID IN MOLDOVA, €649 THOUSAND WORTH OF AID, In Moldova, we continue to support around 2,000 families who have provided shelter for those fleeing war. At the same time, we are also helping to run a helpline here, providing psychosocial assistance in Ukrainian and Russian to those most in need, as well as information about their rights and access to social and health services in Moldova. With local organization, we are planning to build digital learning space and child friendly space for Ukrainian refugee children.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-war-response-supporting-people-newly-liberated-areas-encs
Ukraine Crisis: 10-16 September 2022,News and Press Release,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,22 Sep 2022,"The Ukrainian counteroffensive continued in the Kharkiv region, with Ukrainian forces regaining most previously occupied territory, including the large logistical hubs of Kupiansk and Izium (The Guardian, 12 September 2022). These successes also allowed Ukrainian forces to retake ground in the Luhansk region, which Russian forces had fully occupied since July (ISW, 11 September 2022). Ukrainian counterattacks also continued in the Kherson region with no confirmed territorial gains. On 16 September, Ukrainian forces struck Russia’s occupation headquarters in Kherson during a meeting of Russian-appointed city and municipal heads (ISW, 16 September 2022)., Similar to Russia’s withdrawal from the northern regions in early April, the de-occupation of Kharkiv has revealed atrocities committed by Russian soldiers, including a mass grave with over 400 bodies near Izium and torture chambers across the region (The Guardian, 17 September 2022). Meanwhile, over 20 civilians were killed last week by Russian shelling and missile strikes in the Donetsk, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, and Zaporizhia regions. Additionally, at least four civilians were killed and four were wounded in mine explosions in the Kharkiv, Zaporizhia, and Donetsk regions., For more information, including previous infographics and an interactive dashboard, visit our Ukraine Crisis research hub.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-crisis-10-16-september-2022
"ACLED Regional Overview: Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia (10 - 16 September 2022)",Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,22 Sep 2022,"Last week in Europe, Caucasus, and Central Asia, the Russian military invasion of Ukraine continued amid the ongoing counteroffensive of Ukrainian forces in the Kharkiv and Kherson regions. Amid Ukrainian advances, reports of cross-border shelling and acts of sabotage continued to surface in Russia. Fighting escalated along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact and the disputed border between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Meanwhile, demonstrations in support of migrants’ and refugees’ rights and related to the current cost of living crisis were recorded across the region., In Ukraine, fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces continued in the eastern and southern regions of the country last week. In the Kharkiv region, the Ukrainian counteroffensive continued, with Ukrainian forces regaining most of the previously occupied territory in the region, including the large logistical hubs of Kupiansk and Izium (The Guardian, 12 September 2022). Ukrainian successes in the Kharkiv regions also allowed Ukrainian forces to retake ground in the Luhansk region, which had been fully occupied by Russian forces since July (ISW, 11 September 2022). These events contributed to the 162% increase in violent events in the Luhansk region over the past week relative to the weekly average for the preceding month, as flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Surge Tracker. Ukrainian counterattacks also continued in the Kherson region, albeit with no confirmed territorial gains. On 16 September, Ukrainian forces struck Russia’s occupation headquarters in Kherson during a meeting of Russian-appointed city and municipal heads (ISW, 16 September 2022)., Similar to Russia’s withdrawal from the northern regions in early April, the de-occupation of Kharkiv has revealed atrocities committed by Russian soldiers, including a mass grave with over 400 bodies near Izium and torture chambers across the region (The Guardian, 17 September 2022). Meanwhile, over 20 civilians were killed last week by Russian shelling and missile strikes in the Donetsk, Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, and Zaporizhia regions. Additionally, at least four civilians were killed and four were wounded in mine explosions in the Kharkiv, Zaporizhia, and Donetsk regions., In Russia, the governor of the Belgorod region accused Ukrainian forces of targeting several villages in the border area with artillery fire, killing a civilian. Further cross-border shelling was also reported in Tyotkino in the Kursk region. This shelling contributed to the 66% increase in weekly violent events in Russia in the past month relative to the weekly average for the preceding year. ACLED’s Conflict Change Map also warned of increased violence in the country during the preceding four weeks. Meanwhile, incidents of railway sabotage were reported in the Republic of Tatarstan, the Yamalo-Nenets region, and the Bryansk region. The anti-war Ostanovi Vagoni (’Stop the Wagons’) movement claimed responsibility for two of these incidents aimed at disrupting the movement of Russian military equipment to Ukraine (Activatica, 14 September 2022)., Along the Armenia-Artsakh-Azerbaijan Line of Contact**, **daily clashes between Armenian and Azerbaijani forces continued last week, with fighting intensifying on 13-14 September. Notably, unlike previous recent clashes in the region, much of the fighting last week took place in Armenia in addition to fighting in Azerbaijan and Artsakh. ACLED’s Conflict Change Map also warned of increased violence in the region during the preceding four weeks. Amid the fighting, Russia brokered an initial ceasefire agreement on 13 September; however, clashes continued, prompting the signing of a second US-brokered ceasefire on 14 September (Euronews, 16 September 2022)., According to preliminary estimates, 207 Armenian and 80 Azerbaijani soldiers were killed and hundreds were wounded during the two days of intense fighting (Report Az, 17 September 2022; Azertac, 17 September 2022). Additionally, at least three civilians were killed and over 7,600 were displaced on the Armenian side (168 Hours, Aysor Am, 16 September 2022). As a result of clashes, Azerbaijani forces occupied Armenian territory in several areas of the Vayots Dzor, Syunik, and Gegharkunik regions. Both sides have blamed each other for the escalation; while Armenia accuses Azerbaijan of starting intense shelling unprovoked (Ministry of Defense of Armenia, 13 September 2022), Azerbaijan claims that they were responding to Armenian mining of Azerbaijani re-supply routes (Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan, 13 September 2022). Analysts have linked the flare-up to Russian territorial losses in Ukraine, suggesting that Azerbaijan may be testing the Russian ability to aid Armenia and, at the same time, attempting to compel Armenia toward accepting Azerbaijan’s terms for a future peace treaty (USIP, 15 September 2022)., Meanwhile, three months after a previous round of clashes, fresh fighting erupted on the border between **Kyrgyzstan **and Tajikistan last week. Clashes first broke out on 14 September between border guards in the Batken region of Kyrgyzstan and the Sughd region of Tajikistan. They resulted in the death of two Tajik soldiers and the wounding of 16 people on both sides, including eight civilians. Despite official meetings between the two countries, further fighting broke out on 16 September, resulting in another 59 deaths in Kyrgyzstan and 35 civilian deaths in Tajikistan (BBC, 18 September 2022). These events contributed to a sustained increase in violent events in the Batken region of Kyrgyzstan over the past week relative to the weekly average for the preceding month, as flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Surge Tracker. The Kyrgyz-Tajik border has been the site of a decades-long dispute, with much of the 970-kilometer border yet to be demarcated (RFE/RL, 22 July 2022), prompting sporadic outbreaks of violence (for more, see this ACLED report on violence along the Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan border)., Demonstration activity linked to rising living costs, inflation, and energy prices continued to take place across the region last week, with protests recorded in Albania, Austria, Estonia, **France, Germany, Greece, Italy, North Macedonia, Portugal, **and Spain. In France, a Yellow Vests demonstration in Paris against inflation turned violent when some participants attempted to blend in with a march in support of Ukraine and vandalized street furniture, leading to 103 arrests (Le Parisien, 10 September 2022)., Protests were also observed across the region last week in relation to asylum seekers’ and migrants’ rights. In Belgium, Denmark, Malta, the Netherlands, and Poland, gatherings were recorded to call on governments to adopt a more humane and responsive approach to the influx of refugees. In France, rallies were staged to demand the regularization of immigrant workers.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/acled-regional-overview-europe-caucasus-and-central-asia-10-16-september-2022

Open for signature: declaration for the protection of civilians from the use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas,News and Press Release,AOAV,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",22 Sep 2022,"On 17 June, Ireland concluded consultations on the final text of the ‘Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas,’ (EWIPA). On 18 November, the Declaration will be open for countries to endorse at a high-level signing conference to be held in Dublin., Civilians account globally for 90% of casualties when explosive weapons, such as aerial bombs, rockets, missiles, artillery and mortar projectiles, are used in populated areas. These weapons have a large destructive radius, are inherently inaccurate, or deliver multiple munitions at the same time, factors which generate wide-area effects with reverberating impacts felt well beyond the direct hit. EWIPA are known to cause long-lasting and expensive damage to critical civilian infrastructure, interrupting basic services such as health care and education, and they inflict often irreversible environmental harm. The psychological trauma from EWIPA and the resulting displacement can take decades to heal., The use of EWIPA, and their manifold consequences, are being made painfully clear in Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine, ongoing since 24 February 2022, in which AOAV has recorded 7,233 civilian casualties of explosive weapon use. 97% of recorded civilian casualties in Ukraine have occurred in populated areas., The political declaration is consequently timely. Under the declaration, signatories commit to adopt and carry out national policies and military practices that strive to avoid civilian harm, by “restricting or refraining from” the use of explosive weapons in towns, cities, and other populated areas. There are also provisions regarding the commitment to assist victims, facilitate humanitarian access, and collect and share data about the effects of explosive weapons., Many of the more than 70 countries that participated in negotiating the explosive weapons declaration have expressed their intent to sign it on November 18, or are working toward that decision., Steve Goose, arms director at Human Rights Watch, called the declaration “a strong starting point for future work to better protect civilians during wartime,” stating that “this political commitment sends a strong message that the civilian toll from the widespread use of explosive weapons in populated areas is unacceptable.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/open-signature-declaration-protection-civilians-use-explosive-weapons-populated-areas
"Atrocity Alert No. 318: Ukraine, Syria and the Global Network of R2P Focal Points",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,21 Sep 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., MASS GRAVES DISCOVERED IN IZIUM, UKRAINE, On 15 September multiple mass burial sites were discovered outside of the city of Izium, near Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine. The graves were found in the forest outside the city in areas recently retaken by the Ukrainian government after 5 months of occupation by Russian forces. Ukrainian authorities estimate at least 445 people, including children, are buried at the sites, having so far exhumed almost 150 bodies without coffins., Preliminary findings shed light on how those buried were killed. One mass grave contained the bodies of 17 Ukrainian soldiers, some of whom were tortured and buried with their hands tied. Many of the dead appear to be civilians, with some bearing telltale signs of torture while dozens of others were killed in the shelling of an apartment building. Indiscriminate attacks on civilian infrastructure as well as torture of combatants and civilians are violations of international law that may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity., The graves discovered in Izium follow a pattern of abuse perpetrated by Russian forces while occupying Ukrainian territory. Over 400 bodies were discovered in April in the town of Bucha, outside Kyiv, after Russian forces retreated from the area. Hundreds more were discovered in the surrounding areas, with 95 percent of those killed found to be fatally shot. Similar atrocities took place in and around the southern coastal city of Mariupol, which was besieged for weeks before being taken over by Russian forces in May. While the city still remains under Russian occupation, ousted local authorities claim thousands of people are buried outside the city in a mass grave, which satellite technology documents to be approximately 340 meters, larger than three football fields., Speaking on the grim discovery, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said, “Bucha, Mariupol, now, unfortunately, Izium. Russia leaves death everywhere. And it must be held accountable for it.”, As Ukrainian forces continue to retake territory in the country’s east and south, Russian-installed and supportive government officials in occupied territory in the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and and Zaporizhzhia regions have scheduled referendums to “join Russia” to take place between 23-27 September. On Wednesday, 21 September, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the partial mobilization of Russia’s military reserves to bolster its positions in Ukraine and welcomed the planned referendums., As the conflict continues, parties must take all measures possible to protect civilians in frontline areas. All allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity must be investigated and the perpetrators held accountable, regardless of rank or affiliation., UN COMMISSION REPORTS ONGOING ATROCITIES AND WARNS OF ESCALATION IN SYRIA, The UN Human Rights Council-mandated Commission of Inquiry on Syria (CoI) released a report on 14 September, documenting continued grave violations of international human rights and humanitarian law across Syria, many of which amount to likely war crimes and crimes against humanity. In a press release regarding the report, the Chair of the CoI, Paulo Pinheiro said that, “Syrians face increasing and intolerable hardships, living among the ruins of this lengthy conflict… Syria cannot afford a return to larger-scale fighting, but that is where it may be heading.”, During the reporting period – from 1 January to 30 June 2022 – the CoI documented attacks across northwest Syria that resulted in the killing of dozens of civilians and destruction of civilian objects, including homes, schools, mosques, medical facilities and objects indispensable to the survival of the population, such as a water station serving over 200,000 people. Noting the consequences of fighting in Idlib, Aleppo and elsewhere, the CoI asserted that, “families living in front-line areas have borne the brunt of pro-government forces’ ground-to-ground shelling in these areas, with… children killed on their way to school, men killed as they tended to their shops, and an entire family killed as they gathered outside their home for afternoon tea.”, The Commissioners warned of a possible return to large-scale and deadly violence in Syria, given the threat of another Turkish ground operation in the northeast and ongoing fighting between Turkish-backed and Kurdish-led forces., The CoI also reported that across government-controlled areas in the central, west and southwest of Syria, arbitrary arrests, disappearances and ill-treatment continue to be perpetrated on a systematic basis. The report calls on UN member states to create an international and independent mechanism to coordinate and consolidate claims regarding missing and disappeared persons and to help clarify their fate. Such a mechanism has long been advocated for by the CoI, as well as Syrian and international civil society organizations. In August the UN Secretary-General released a study recommending that the General Assembly establish a mechanism dedicated to clarifying the fate and whereabouts of missing persons in Syria, as well as supporting victims, survivors and their families., The protracted crisis in Syria demands increased international attention, not less. UN member states should urgently work toward the establishment of an independent international mechanism to clarify the fate and whereabouts of those missing and disappeared in Syria as recommended by the CoI and the Secretary-General, as well as continue to pursue accountability for alleged perpetrators of atrocities under universal jurisdiction., 10TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE GLOBAL NETWORK OF R2P FOCAL POINTS, The Global Network of R2P Focal Points held its 10th annual meeting on 15-16 September in Washington, D.C. The meeting, hosted by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect at the headquarters of the Organization of American States (OAS), brought together senior officials from governments and regional organizations, the UN Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect, and members of civil society. While opening the meeting, OAS Secretary General, Luis Almagro Lemes, reiterated his organization’s support for implementation of R2P because “the failure to act, the failure to prevent in the face of atrocities has resulted in the most devastating and avoidable tragedies of our lifetime.”, The 10th annual meeting featured sessions on how regional organizations can be an important tool in preventing and responding to mass atrocities, on bridging the gap between R2P and the Women, Peace and Security agenda – as well as wider consideration of the gender lens within atrocity prevention – and on the role civil society actors can play in enabling governments to protect populations more effectively., Participants shared insights from their own governments and organizations on how to prioritize atrocity prevention, including highlighting the OAS’ newly-launched report entitled, “The Responsibility to Protect and the Organization of American States: A Path Forward for Atrocity Prevention and Response in the Americas” and the United States’ “Strategy to Anticipate, Prevent, and Respond to Atrocities.” While introducing the strategy, H.E. Uzra Zeya, United States Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, asserted that, “the United States refuses to accept that atrocities and human rights abuses are beyond global partners’ power to prevent and counteract, and we believe justice is both possible and incredibly necessary. We can do better. The world can do better.”, During the meeting R2P Focal Points heard shared perspectives from affected communities and representatives of survivor groups, including moving reflections regarding ongoing threats to populations and missed opportunities for prevention in Ukraine, Myanmar and Venezuela from the Ambassador of Ukraine to the United States, H.E. Oksana Markarova, the Executive Director of Centro de Justicia y Paz (CEPAZ), Beatriz Borges, and the Founder and Executive Director of the Women’s Peace Network, Wai Wai Nu. During working sessions participants heard recommendations on how to prevent further crimes, including efforts launched to ensure accountability for perpetrators of atrocities in Ukraine, renewing the mandate of the Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela during the current Human Rights Council session, and adopting a resolution on Myanmar in the UN Security Council., R2P Focal Points are senior government officials who aim to promote R2P and atrocity prevention at the national, regional and international level. The Global Network of R2P Focal Points was launched in September 2010 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and the Global Centre for R2P serves as its Secretariat. More than 60 governments and two regional organizations have joined the network.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/atrocity-alert-no-318-ukraine-syria-and-global-network-r2p-focal-points
Update 105 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (21 Sep 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,"Disaster Management
Recovery and Reconstruction",21 Sep 2022,"Renewed shelling early on Wednesday morning at the site of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) damaged cables providing electricity to one of its six units, temporarily forcing this reactor to rely on emergency diesel generators for the power it needs for essential safety functions, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was informed at the site by senior Ukrainian operating staff., Two of the three emergency diesel generators of reactor unit 6 started automatically and operated for about 40 minutes following the shelling that occurred at 01:13am local time near the unit’s turbine hall which is next to the reactor building. They were no longer needed after the operator was again able to access external electricity for unit 6 from the ZNPP’s existing main power line, through the switchyard of the nearby thermal power station., The ZNPP’s five other reactors were not affected, continuing to receive power directly from the plant’s off-site power line that was restored last week. Work is under way to repair the damaged cables of unit 6, as are efforts to restore this unit’s direct connection to the ZNPP’s external power line. The ZNPP’s six reactors are all in a cold shutdown state but still require power for maintaining cooling and other vital safety functions., Director General Rafael Grossi – who is at the United Nations in New York this week for high-level consultations regarding his proposal to establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP – said he was gravely concerned about the latest shelling at the site of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant., He stressed the importance of the IAEA being at the site to observe and report about such incidents in an impartial and independent manner. In this context, the Director General reiterated that the IAEA team present at the site for the past three weeks were able to transmit information directly to Agency headquarters in Vienna and conduct their activities without any impediment, restriction or interruption., Wednesday’s incident came after another shelling episode the previous day, at one of the ZNPP site’s spray cooling ponds, which are part of the plant’s heat removal system. The pipe was damaged, taking the pond out of service pending repairs. There were also reports of shelling yesterday at the industrial site around the thermal power station, located a few kilometres from the ZNPP., “This once again demonstrates the urgent necessity to establish such a zone around the ZNPP. Until yesterday, there seemed to be less shelling at or near the plant, but this latest episode shows that the danger remains very real. It hasn’t gone away, and we can’t afford to lose any more time,” Director General Grossi said. “I’m determined to do everything I can so that the nuclear safety and security protection zone around the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) becomes reality very soon. My high-level meetings at the United Nations this week are crucial to achieve this objective that is of paramount importance in preventing a severe nuclear accident from happening.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-105-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-21-sep-2022
"Airlines, Freight Forwarders, and Nonprofit Consortium Pledge Big Boost to Humanitarian Aid for Ukrainians at Clinton Global Initiative",News and Press Release,Airlink,"Coordination
Health
Logistics and Telecommunications",21 Sep 2022,"*As part of this year’s Clinton Global Initiative 2022 Meeting, disaster logistics nonprofit Airlink and its consortium of airlines, freight forwarders, and humanitarian aid organizations have announced a commitment to sending one thousand responders and one thousand tons of humanitarian aid to support Ukrainians’ impact by the Russian invasion. *, Sept. 20, 2022 (New York)- - The ‘Commitment to Action’ on behalf of the people of Ukraine titled AviationCARES: Ukraine Response was made at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) 2022 meeting. The United Nations estimates that almost 18M people will require humanitarian assistance in the coming months, especially as winter approaches. The consortium of airlines, NGOs, philanthropic foundations, and freight forwarders have worked together before through disaster response nonprofit Airlink, which has organized the airlift and delivery of humanitarian relief for Ukraine and other disaster responses worldwide., The response faces myriad challenges, and a wide range of aid is still needed six months later. In Ukraine, access to clean water and hygiene items continues to be disrupted, where sanitation infrastructure has been destroyed, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases. Hostilities and infrastructure damage have led to severe supply chain disruptions, resulting in unreliable access to food and essential items; half of all Ukrainians are currently food insecure. Health systems are overwhelmed due to conflict, mass displacement, lack of supplies, and damage or destruction of hospital and clinic buildings. This boost in support to Ukraine and displaced Ukrainians in surrounding countries will increase access to medical and mental health care, shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), food, protection, and other services through winter and into 2023., The AviationCARES: Ukraine Response ‘Commitment to Action’ builds on and doubles the amount of aid going to Ukraine through Airlink and its partners. Since February, Airlink and its partners have delivered 559 responders and 572 tons of aid, helping an estimated 3.7 million Ukrainians displaced inside of Ukraine and those in Hungary, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia., “We are humbled to be able to continue our support for the people affected by the Ukraine crisis through the Clinton Global Initiative. We are also proud to be able to use our freighters to assist in the transport of aid, which includes critical medical and humanitarian supplies via Airlink,” said Jason Berry, Vice President, Cargo at Air Canada., Partners to the AviationCARES: Ukraine Response commitment to mobilize 1,000 responders and 1,000 tons of aid include United Airlines, Air Canada Cargo, Alaska Airlines, Flexport, SEKO Logistics, ISTAT and the ISTAT Foundation, the Tzu Chi Charity Foundation, the UPS Foundation, Convoy of Hope, CORE, Footprint Project, GlobalMedic, MedShare, Project CURE, Project HOPE, Team Rubicon, and World Hope International. The ‘Commitment to Action’ also involves working directly with local nonprofit actors and organizations to empower a locally-driven response and foster closer links between local and external organizations., Two of the biggest challenges to the effective delivery of aid post-disaster are costs of transport and management of the supply chain and the coordination of aid so that supply meets the on-the-ground needs. An estimated 60% of the aid sent in emergencies by individuals, corporations, governments, and nonprofit organizations is inappropriate when it arrives in-country. It may not be needed at all and will eventually be destroyed. Additionally, research conducted by the Kuehne Logistics University, HELP Logistics and several NGOs found that between 2005 and 2018, supply chain expenditure averaged 73% of total humanitarian relief expenses. Airlink exists to remove the costs of airlift and transportation for nonprofits responding to humanitarian disasters and to enable coordination and cooperation to happen amongst NGOs at the outset of a response., “Airlink is thrilled to be leading this Commitment to Action, bringing together a wide range of partners from the private sector and civil society to continue to support the ongoing needs of Ukrainians throughout Eastern Europe,” said Steve Smith, Airlink President and CEO. “In disaster response and logistics, cooperation, collaboration, and utilizing the expertise in the private, NGO and philanthropic sectors is critical. We could always do more with more resources, but without cooperation, we couldn’t achieve anything.”, End, About the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI): The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) convenes global and emerging leaders to create and implement solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges. CGI works with partners to drive action through its unique model. Rather than directly implementing projects, CGI facilitates action by helping members connect, collaborate, and develop Commitments to Action — new, specific, and measurable plans that address global challenges. Through CGI, the community has made more than 3,700 Commitments to Action that have made a difference in the lives of more than 435 million people in more than 180 countries., About Airlink: Airlink (www.airlinkflight.org) is a nonprofit organization providing free and heavily subsidized flights and air transport for pre-screened nonprofits to deliver disaster responders and supplies in the wake of humanitarian crises worldwide. Its network includes more than 130 aid organizations and 47 commercial and charter airlines. Its first mission was in response to the Haiti earthquake. Since its inception in 2010, Airlink’s airline partners have flown nearly 8,000 relief workers and transported more than 4,000,000 pounds of humanitarian cargo, saving nonprofits over $14 million in air transport costs. In addition, Airlink receives in-kind gifts from airlines and donations from organizations and individuals within the aviation sector. In 2020 the humanitarian aid Airlink moved assisted 5.5 million people in the aftermath of natural and human-made disasters.

"Second Joint Statement by the Heads of FAO, IMF, WBG, WFP, and WTO on the Global Food Security and Nutrition Crisis",News and Press Release,FAO,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",21 Sep 2022,"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Director General QU Dongyu, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, World Bank Group (WBG) President David Malpass, World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director David Beasley and World Trade Organization (WTO) Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala issued the following second joint statement calling for urgent action to address the global food security crisis., The war in Ukraine continues to exacerbate the global food security and nutrition crisis, with high and volatile energy, food and fertilizer prices, restrictive trade policies, and supply chain disruptions. Despite the reprieve in global food prices and the resumption of grain exports from the Black Sea, food remains beyond reach for many due to high prices and weather shocks. The number of people facing acute food insecurity worldwide is expected to continue to rise. Fertilizer markets remain volatile, especially in Europe, where tight natural gas supplies and high prices have caused many producers of urea and ammonia to stop operations. This may reduce fertilizer application rates for the next crop season, prolonging and deepening the impact of the crisis., There has been considerable progress in four key areas we had highlighted in our first joint statement. Announced or implemented social assistance measures across all economies quadrupled from 37 to 148 between April and September 2022. We welcome the efforts of the Global Crisis Response Group and the Black Sea Grain Initiative: through the Joint Coordination Centre, over 3 million metric tons of grain and foodstuffs have already been exported from Ukraine. We are encouraged by the downward trend of trade restrictive measures implemented by countries and hope that the trend continues. International financial support to the most vulnerable countries is increasing from various initiatives. The World Bank is implementing its $30 billion program to respond to the food security crisis and frontloading resources from the IDA20 Crisis Response Window. The IMF is proposing a new food shock window within the IMF emergency lending instruments. The FAO has proposed a series of policy recommendations and launched detail soil nutrition maps at country level to increase efficiencies in the use of fertilizers., Maintaining momentum on these fronts and building resilience for the future will require a continued comprehensive and coordinated effort to* support efficient production and trade, improve transparency, accelerate innovation and joint planning and invest in food systems transformation*:, Support efficient production and trade: Governments in all countries need to urgently re-examine their agricultural trade and market interventions, such as subsidies and export restrictions, to identify and minimize distortions. Shorter interventions cause less harm than indefinite ones. Promoting the production of nutritious foods and repurposing the US$639 billion support per year provided to agriculture by governments can transform food systems and improve food security and nutrition. Preserving open trade in food, agriculture, and energy can reduce price distortions that dilute incentives for efficient production. Countries should follow through on commitments made at the WTO's 12th Ministerial Conference to restrain export restrictions on food and fertilizers and put in place trade facilitation measures. We also welcome clarifications of relevant regulations to allow critical agricultural inputs such as fertilizers to move swiftly to countries in need., Improve transparency: Food market monitoring serves as an important and efficient early warning mechanism and must be supplemented with transparent tracking of financing by the international community to respond to the food crisis. Governments should provide necessary data and resources to support Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS), which enhances transparency in food markets through monitoring the prices and availability of major food crops and promoting policy responses. In addition, the Global Alliance for Food Security (GAFS) is harmonizing existing tracking systems in a dashboard to enable governments and country teams to identify needs and channel financing to respond to the crisis., Accelerate innovation and joint planning: Agricultural research and development is a chronically underinvested sector, while it has one of the highest returns on public spending. Innovation is crucial for meeting the long-term challenges to global food security and nutrition posed by climate change, land and ecosystem degradation, pests, and transboundary plant and animal diseases. Disseminating best practices from FAO and supporting the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers (OneCGIAR) are important actions to address these challenges. Such efforts should also lead to more systematic coordination and joint planning to connect short-, medium- and long-term opportunities and deliver support in a timely manner., Invest in food systems transformation: Strengthening the resilience of food systems to risks, including conflict, extreme weather events, economic shocks and diseases is key for the longer-term response. Addressing both infrastructure bottlenecks and input supply bottlenecks (e.g., fertilizers and seeds) are critical to an efficient food supply system. Effective and sustainable support to smallholder farmers will be vital to ensure they are part of the solution and to localize supply chains. The private sector has a critical role to play, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) will establish a Global Food Security Platform that will provide working capital and longer-term financing for sustainable agribusinesses and related sectors in the food supply chain. Deeper integration of markets can also help avoid price spikes of essential goods and drive economic diversification and job creation to build overall resilience., We remain committed to working together to address immediate food security and nutrition needs, tackle structural market issues that may exacerbate adverse impacts, and build countries' resilience to prevent and mitigate the impacts of future crises.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/second-joint-statement-heads-fao-imf-wbg-wfp-and-wto-global-food-security-and-nutrition-crisis
IsraAID partners with Ukraine's gov't to provide mental health care,News and Press Release,IsraAID,Health,21 Sep 2022,"IsraAID is building a mental health infrastructure in Ukrainian hospitals, as part of an initiative established by the Office of the First Lady, | Tuesday, September 20, 2022. For immediate release:, IsraAID, Israel's leading non-governmental humanitarian aid organization, is working to build a mental health infrastructure in Ukrainian hospitals amid the ongoing fighting with Russia. IsraAID is partnering with Barrier Free -- a Ukrainian NGO that supports mental health initiatives -- and the Ukrainian Ministry of Health. The partnership was established with the blessing and active support of the Office of the First Lady of Ukraine, Olena Zelenska., IsraAID is funding and training psychologists, social workers and other mental health providers that will be deployed to hospitals in Ukrainian cities. IsraAID held its first training with Ministry of Health officials last week, focusing on preventing burnout, mental health, and self care. The psychologists trained by the joint venture will work to support both patients and first responders at civil hospitals, which are working around the clock to support the Ukrainian population during this time of crisis. Together, IsraAID and partners are working to adapt the organization's global humanitarian expertise to meet the needs of the Ukrainian people and build resilience., In July, IsraAID began working within the borders of Ukraine, expanding on its emergency response missions in Moldova and Romania. The first psychosocial workshops in Ukraine were piloted that month in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, which was the site of mass civilian casualties during the first weeks of the war, and in Odesa. IsraAID has since established offices in Kyiv and Odesa., In addition to its work in mental health and psychological support, IsraAID is working to expand access to safe drinking water in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, about 130km east of Odessa, after the city's water infrastructure suffered widespread damage in the fighting. IsraAID has also partnered with the Ukrainian-Israeli NGO Frida to furnish and operate mobile medical clinics in Kyiv and the surrounding areas., IsraAID launched its response to the ongoing Ukraine crisis on February 26th, two days after the Russian invasion, dispatching an Emergency Response team to Moldova to provide urgent support to the thousands of Ukrainian refugees crossing into the country. IsraAID's team was one of the first international groups to reach the border crossing at Palanca, in southern Moldova, around 50km from Odesa. In Moldova, IsraAID has been working on protection, education, and medical support for refugees both at the border and in formal and informal shelters around the country., In Romania, IsraAID has been operating the Tulcea Humanitarian Logistics Hub -- the only humanitarian hub with a verified supply chain directly to southern Ukraine. Together with international partners, IsraAID has delivered over $35 million worth of essential aid -- including food, medical supplies, bedding, clothing, diapers and more -- to communities in urgent need. IsraAID's new work in Ukraine builds on the relationships and trust established with communities across the country through the work of the Tulcea Humanitarian Logistics Hub., -ENDS-, Further information is available on request, including interviews with IsraAID CEO Yotam Polizer and other individuals involved in this operation., CONTACT:

UNDP signs MOU with Ministry for Communities and Territories Development of Ukraine to enhance the effectiveness of recovery and development efforts [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,Recovery and Reconstruction,20 Sep 2022,"Emphasis on increasing capacity to assess, plan and implement recovery strategies using latest GIS technologies., KYIV, 20 September 2022 – The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) today signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry for Communities and Territories Development of Ukraine to strengthen the capacity of local and municipal governments to assess, plan and implement recovery strategies based on evidence-based damage assessment, mapping and data monitoring., Under the terms of the agreement, UNDP agrees to conduct assessments of war damage to housing, as well as administrative and social infrastructure facilities and to help develop a comprehensive Geographic Information System (GIS) that will visualize, monitor and provide basic analysis related to recovery sequencing and prioritization. This will enhance the Government’s capacity to map damage assessments in part through remote sensing and drone image analysis integrated with government data. The system complements the World Banks’s Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (RDNA) by providing more detail at the local and municipal levels. The RDNA estimates the current cost of reconstruction and recovery in Ukraine to be $349 billion., Minister for Communities and Territories Development Oleksii Chernyshov said the memorandum of understanding should consolidate and strengthen cooperation with UNDP. “Our task is rapid and efficient reconstruction, and the implementation of an effective regional policy,” said Chernyshov. “This requires comprehensive monitoring of regional development indicators. The geoinformation system will be a platform for monitoring the development of communities and a means of interaction between the central authorities and local government."", ""Interim UNDP Resident Representative Manal Fouani said the goal is to leverage the latest technology together with international best practices to design the best solution for Ukraine’s current context. “UNDP is able to tap into the best GIS-based technologies from around the world and apply them to our work with the Government here in Ukraine,” she said. “The GIS-based system we are developing will enable government authorities to monitor and update the damage assessments at central, regional and local levels.”, UNDP will compile the damage assessment data and maps using remote sensing and drone image analysis, and existing damage assessment data collated by each Oblast Regional State Administration, based on inputs from local administration authorities – including relevant damage data collected by other line ministries and self-reporting through the Diia application. This process will produce effective response and recovery plans, maximizing value from limited recovery resources., UNDP has been supporting central, regional and local government in Ukraine for almost 30 years. Throughout the war, UNDP has remained on the ground in Ukraine with some 380 staff, helping authorities plan their emergency responses and ensure continuity of public service delivery, including to war-affected populations. The organization is working closely with the Government to put in place the foundations for recovery and reconstruction – prioritizing approaches that are green, just, inclusive and digital., Media enquiries: Yuliia Samus, UNDP Ukraine Communications Lead; e-mail: yuliia.samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/undp-signs-mou-ministry-communities-and-territories-development-ukraine-enhance-effectiveness-recovery-and-development-efforts-enuk
Update 104 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (19 Sep 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,"Disaster Management
Recovery and Reconstruction",19 Sep 2022,"Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that shelling caused an explosion near the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant (SUNPP) early today, impacting three power lines and damaging windows at the site, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said., Ukraine told the IAEA that the explosion took place around 300 metres from the SUNPP industrial site. The affected power lines did not include any of the 750 kilovolt (kV) lines connecting the plant to the grid., Ukraine’s national operator Energoatom separately said the SUNPP’s three reactors were continuing to operate normally and that no staff were injured. The three power lines were automatically reconnected after a short period of time, it said. The SUNPP is located about 250 km from the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), Europe’s largest. Ukraine also has two other nuclear power plants., In another significant development highlighting continuing severe risks to nuclear safety and security during the current conflict in Ukraine, a power line that has been used to supply the ZNPP with electricity from the Ukrainian grid through the switchyard of a nearby thermal power station was disconnected yesterday, IAEA experts at the site learnt. The cause was not immediately clear., The ZNPP – whose six reactors are currently in a cold shutdown state – still receives the electricity it needs for essential safety functions from a 750 KV external power line that was restored on Friday, but it now does not have access to back-up power from the grid, the IAEA experts said., “The situation at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant remains fragile and precarious. Last week, we saw some improvements regarding its power supplies, but today we were informed about a new setback in this regard. The plant is located in the middle of a war zone, and its power status is far from safe and secure. Therefore, a nuclear safety and security protection zone must urgently be established there,” Director General Grossi said., The Director General will later this week travel to the United Nations in New York for high-level consultations on such a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP, which has frequently been shelled over the past two months. In recent days, there has been no shelling at the plant itself, but it continues in the wider area near the plant, he said., ‘While we have recently focused on the urgent need for action to prevent a nuclear accident at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant – establishing an IAEA presence there earlier this month – today’s explosion near the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant all too clearly demonstrates the potential dangers also at other nuclear facilities in the country,” Director General Grossi said. “Any military action that threatens nuclear safety and security is unacceptable and must stop immediately.”, As part of the IAEA’s assistance and support to Ukraine in ensuring nuclear safety and security during the conflict, Director General Grossi travelled to the SUNPP in March, the first of the three IAEA missions he has led to the country over the past half year, including the one to the ZNPP on 1 September.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-104-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-19-sep-2022
New inclusive website provides Ukrainians with critical information on surviving the war [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,Protection and Human Rights,20 Sep 2022,"Content-rich platform developed by UNDP, EU and partners accessible to people with disabilities and the elderly, Kyiv, 20 September 2022 – A new website for Ukrainians affected by the war provides information on the legal rules for crossing the border, the procedure for obtaining the status of an internally displaced person (IDP), opportunities for receiving humanitarian aid and psychological support during wartime, advice on finding educational opportunities and work, and much more. The information is useful for refugees, the internally displaced and citizens in their home oblasts., The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine and the European Union supported the launch of the new website which was created in a way to meet the needs of people with disabilities and the elderly to the fullest extent possible., Frederik Coene, Head of Cooperation at the EU Delegation to Ukraine, said especially in wartime, it is of utmost importance to harness the power of digitalization to meet the needs of vulnerable populations as much as possible. “With the onset of a full-scale invasion, people with disabilities and the elderly found themselves in a state of terrible uncertainty,” he said. “I expect this web platform, which we supported together with UNDP, will become a strong support for them in these difficult times and will help renew faith in a better future.”, Manal Fouani, interim UNDP Resident Representative in Ukraine, said that enhancing the inclusion element is pivotal for every recovery plan. “This war is leading to massive and indiscriminate destruction and increased vulnerabilities across Ukraine,” Fouani said. “We at UNDP believe that it’s time to develop an inclusive recovery and reconstruction plan for Ukraine and act on it immediately, as many civilians require specialized services to overcome the consequences of the war.”, “The website, which was launched with the support of our partners at the Delegation of the European Union to Ukraine, will certainly be a reliable guide and source of critical information for everyone – especially for those with disabilities, and for the elderly.”, Victoria Nazarenko, General Secretary of the NGO “National Assembly of People with Disabilities of Ukraine” is grateful for the work of UNDP and the EU for creating a web platform that fully complies with the principles of information accessibility. “The lack of information in an accessible format, the inability of independently joining the evacuation routes, underequipped air raid shelters and shelters for temporary living – all these factors only worsened uncertainties among the elderly and people with disabilities,” she said. “This website them and their relatives to get the necessary information on time and in full, preventing additional problems and stress in these difficult times for all of us.”, The website was developed by three organizations, in particular the NGO “National Assembly of People with Disabilities of Ukraine,” the NGO “Pro.UD | Universal design” and the NGO “Coalition for the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities due to intellectual impairments.” The website was launched with the financial support of the European Union under the UN Recovery and Peacebuilding Programme., Media enquiries: Yulia Samus, UNDP Ukraine Communications Lead; e-mail: yuliia.samus@undp.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/new-inclusive-website-provides-ukrainians-critical-information-surviving-war-enuk
Lviv Invest Office to boost business amid war [EN/UK],News and Press Release,UNDP,Recovery and Reconstruction,20 Sep 2022,"New office brings more business development opportunities for local and relocated enterprises in Lviv city and oblast, Lviv, Ukraine, 20 September 2022 – Entrepreneurs in Lviv city and oblast have a new way to find out about investment opportunities in the region, business support programmes, as well as a source advice on export opportunities following the opening of the Lviv Invest Office., The Lviv Invest Office was created as a joint initiative of Lviv Regional Administration, Lviv City Council and the Ukrainian Catholic University (UCU) Business School, with support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine. The office’s managing director is Taras Yeleiko, an expert with 15 years of experience in investment, financial management, and asset management in the public and private sectors., Yeleiko says the office’s goal is to help entrepreneurs make business operations easier at all stages, from searching for start-up investments, to applying for preferential loans to accelerate business development., “This is especially important now, when the country is in a state of war,” says Yeleiko. “I’m sure that the office will simplify the interaction between the private and public sectors. In addition, this activity will strengthen the economic backbone of Ukraine – and Lviv region in particular.”, Maksym Kozytskyi, Head of Lviv Regional State Administration, says that even during full-scale war, the economy can and should work. “Lviv region is an attractive area for investment,” Kozytskyi says. “Our competitive advantage is not only favourable geography, resources and people, but the quality and speed of services. The Invest Office – a single entrance window for investors and businesses – will help show off the attractiveness of the region.”, Among their most acute needs, Ukrainian businesses list the need for financing (stated by 35.9 percent of respondents), establishing new partnerships (27.1 percent), and developing export activities (25.1 percent). The Invest Office strives to help entrepreneurs meet precisely these needs., Andrii Sadovyi, Lviv City Mayor, says Lviv is open to businesses and investment. “Before the start of full-scale war, the city was actively developing, with the help of international and domestic investors,” Sadovyi said. “Now our region has also become a hub for relocated businesses. Entrepreneurs need quality assistance, provided to them from the very beginning, and that satisfies all their needs within the shortest possible time.”, While the Lviv Invest Office is designed to assist all Ukrainian businesses, it has a particular focus on relocated enterprises, informing displaced entrepreneurs about available business development opportunities in Lviv city and oblast., Sophia Opatska, Vice-Rector for Strategic Development of Ukrainian Catholic University (UCU) and Founding Dean of the UCU Business School, says that the economic front is currently of high importance for recovery of Ukraine. “Communicating with business on a daily basis, we acknowledge how difficult it is to continue business activity, support employees and pay taxes,” Opatska says. “At the same time, we need to understand: if we want not only to rebuild Ukraine, but to build back better, we need new partnerships with foreign companies, foreign investments, and the latest technologies."", Maksym Boroda, UNDP Project Manager, stresses that the Lviv Investment Office is an important element of the business support infrastructure for both local and relocated enterprises affected by the war. “Supporting the office’s launch is an opportunity for UNDP not only to contribute to the economic recovery of the region and the country as a whole, but also to pilot this toolkit for its further scaling and dissemination,” says Boroda., Lviv Invest Office activities and events are being implemented in the framework of the “Support to Entrepreneurs and Livelihoods” Project which is funded and implemented by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Ukraine, in cooperation with Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk City Councils., The project seeks to achieve two interconnected outputs: to boost the capacity of local institutions to support business relocation and continuity, and to provide war-affected local and relocated businesses with rapid relief so they can stay in business., These interventions add to the incentives set by local authorities, as well as to subsequent phases of recovery, where support will focus on strengthening businesses to become export-oriented, with the aim of continuing the internationalization of Ukraine’s economy., The office is located at 2, Rynok Square, Lviv.

"World Food Programme delivers critical food assistance to 100,000 Ukrainians in newly accessible areas near frontline",News and Press Release,WFP,Food and Nutrition,20 Sep 2022,"KYIV – The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and its partners have over the last few days distributed more than 70,000 food rations in Kharkiv oblast, 30,000 rations in Kherson oblast, and 500 rations in Luhansk oblast, reaching communities who have only just become accessible to humanitarian agencies., Most of the people that WFP and its partners reached in those areas had not received humanitarian assistance since April, despite multiple attempts by WFP and other UN agencies to secure access. WFP notably delivered food in Izium, Balakliya, and Shevchenkove in Kharkiv oblast, both with its local partners and as part of UN interagency convoys., “We’re proud of the incredible work that our local partners have been able to achieve in a short time – in some cases as quickly as 48 hours after these areas became accessible, risking their lives to deliver lifesaving aid,” said Matthew Hollingworth, WFP Country Director in Ukraine. “The reality is that many families living near the frontline do not have a reliable access to nutritious foods,” Hollingworth added., Most of WFP’s food boxes contain wheat flour or rice, pasta, canned protein (meat or beans), and sunflower oil. They are designed to cover a person’s essential food needs for 30 days. WFP also distributes ready-to-eat rations and locally baked bread in places where families are on the move or may be unable to cook., Food assistance is one of many ways WFP supports Ukrainians affected by the war. WFP also distributes cash to vulnerable Ukrainians, and has disbursed more than US$240 million to 1.5 million people to date. WFP supported the resumption of grain exports through Black Sea ports, directly benefiting Ukrainian farmers and the agricultural sector. The wheat, bread, and sunflower oil that WFP distributes to Ukrainians are all procured locally in Ukraine., WFP’s food assistance in Ukraine is generously funded by USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the European Union, France, Germany, Japan, Iceland, The Republic of Korea, Kuwait, the Federated States of Micronesia, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Timor Leste, and private donors., The United Nations World Food Programme is the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change., CONTACT, Antoine Vallas, WFP/Kyiv, Tel+380 952501154

The Ministry of Social Policy for the third time submitted a list of vulnerable people to receive financial aid to the UNHCR,News and Press Release,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,20 Sep 2022,"To access the cash assistance, people who fit the criteria need to register directly through the eDopomoga platform:, The Ministry of Social Policy, as part of the memorandum with the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), submitted a list of applications for the payment of financial assistance to 130,000 vulnerable people -- pensioners who are not displaced but in need of support, and who have already registered an application for financial assistance from international organizations on the eDopomoga platform., This is the third list provided to the UNHCR as part of the memorandum. According to the previous lists submitted on 12 May 2022 and 26 June 2022, cash assistance has already been paid by UNHCR to 143,338 people., To date, 2,545,645 people are included in the lists compiled by the Ministry of Social Policy and submitted to various international organizations, out of which 901,052 people have already received cash assistance., Vulnerable groups of people, in particular people with disabilities, pensioners, single parents raising children on their own, and low-income families are prioritized among the people who receive assistance., We remind you that in order to access the cash assistance, people who fit the criteria need to register directly through the eDopomoga platform. The platform eDopomoga has three directions of support for Ukrainians: state, volunteer and international. International aid provides an opportunity to submit an application for financial support from international organizations. For its part, the Ministry of Social Policy verifies the applicant's data using existing state information registers and databases, which allows international organizations to receive verified information about the person., Please note that after the transfer of payment lists, international organizations carry out an additional check to prevent duplication of payments, in order to ensure access to this assistance for those who need it., For reference:, The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is a global organization dedicated to saving lives, protecting rights and building a better future for refugees, internally displaced communities and stateless persons. Since 1950, UNHCR has coordinated international efforts to protect people displaced by conflict or persecution.

UNICEF co-chairs the cash working group task team on harmonizing humanitarian cash and social protection transfers and is in a strong position to lead a future transition from humanitarian assistance to government programmes. The programme continues to attract massive interest, with approximately 3,000 new applications every day. The dedicated beneficiary hotline also receives thousands of calls per day. The UNICEF website describing the programme had the most visits of any page in the region in July, by a factor of more than 20x., A recently concluded MoU with the Ministry of Social Policy which allows UNICEF access to applications made in the government’s e-dopomoga platform, where Ukrainians can apply for help and be referred to relevant international agencies. This will allow UNICEF to report back to the government which of these households it has already assisted (inspiring confidence in the professionalism of UNICEF’s programme), as well as eventually allowing us to move away from our own self-registration and rely exclusively on government registration channels. Integration with government databases will also allow the programme to extend targeting criteria (e.g. geographic or income thresholds) and rely on validation through the government’s own systems and databases.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/unicef-ukraine-humanitarian-response-children-inside-ukraine-factsheets-no-9-24-february-29-august-2022

Shelter and Non-Food Items",14 Sep 2022,"Kyiv – I have been deeply affected by the unimaginable human suffering and destruction that I have witnessed during the last four days spent in Ukraine., For people here, the war that began six months ago is a painful, daily reality. More than 5,700 civilians have died and a further 8,200 have been injured; the actual toll likely being far higher. Millions of families have been uprooted, infrastructure destroyed, homes turned to rubble and essential services disrupted., Over 6.9 million people are internally displaced, and more than 7 million others have fled outside Ukraine., I was honored to meet His Excellency President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. We discussed the human cost of the war and what the International Organization for Migration (IOM) can further do to alleviate human suffering., We agreed that more can and must be done by the international community, the United Nations (UN) and the Ukrainian diaspora to help the country recover and stabilize. I welcomed his commitment to work with IOM, the wider UN system and our local partners to ensure the continuity of aid, and eventual recovery., While international support is focused on meeting humanitarian needs, we must also support sustainable livelihoods and work with the Ukrainian authorities and communities to rebuild and promote community stabilization. This can be achieved by supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, rehabilitating schools and repairing institutions that are providing vital support services., IOM has already assisted close to 800,000 Ukrainians with relief items, cash support, and health services, among others. We are also supporting micro-businesses, small enterprises, and startups with cash grants, training and consultancy services. Some of these businesses had to relocate due to the war, others employ displaced people, providing a lifeline to those in dire need of income. These programmes are critical as nearly half of the internally displaced persons in Ukraine are not currently earning an income, according to IOM’s surveys., Mental health and psychosocial support to displaced people and communities affected by the war was at the forefront of my discussions with Vice Prime Minster Iryna Vereshchuk and Minister of Health Viktor Liashko. This is a critical component of IOM’s response in Ukraine as we continue to boost the national capacity as well as deliver direct assistance tackling these issues., I am humbled by the strength and resilience of the Ukrainian people in the face of immense challenges. Their love for their country and their commitment to rebuilding is truly inspiring. With winter approaching, many tens of thousands, perhaps millions of internally displaced persons will need help to get through the coldest months. We stand with them. We are already ramping up our winterization support to help people prepare for what will come., Equally humbling and impressive is the work of our IOM staff, many of whom have themselves been displaced by the war or suffered great personal tragedies. They are demonstrating the best of humanity, bringing solace to the vulnerable and showing us all that there can, must and will be a brighter tomorrow., Everywhere I have been in Ukraine and its neighbouring countries in recent months, Ukrainians have voiced their deep desire to return home. IOM will continue working with the Government of Ukraine and other partners to help create conditions that are conducive for their safe return., Most importantly, all interventions, aid and support must embrace and empower local communities and engage the diaspora, who are indispensable to the recovery of Ukraine. We are committed to supporting Ukrainians in need with thanks to the steady and generous donor support we have received so far, and which I hope will continue for as long as necessary., For more information, please contact:, In Geneva:, Safa Msehli, smsehli@iom.int, +41 794 035 526, In Ukraine:, Varvara Zhluktenko, vzhluktenko@iom.int, +38 067 447 97 92, Jorge Galindo, jgalindo@iom.int, +38 093 631 92 60, In Vienna:, Joe Lowry, jlowry@iom.int, +43 660 3776404",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/iom-chief-statement-following-meeting-president-zelenskyy-and-visit-ukraine
Ukraine: Mass graves in Izium is a macabre reminder of the cost of Russian aggression,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,16 Sep 2022,"Reacting to the reported discovery of a mass burial site containing the bodies of Ukrainian civilians and military in a forest near the town of Izium, Kharkiv region, which the Ukrainian army recaptured following months of Russian occupation, Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said:, “Back in March, Amnesty International sounded the alarm bell over the fate of civilians in Izium which had been under relentless attack by Russian forces since day four of Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine. These newly reported discoveries confirm our darkest fears. The people of Ukraine and the world deserve to know how exactly those buried in the forest near Izium have died. For every unlawful killing or other war crime, there must be justice and reparation for victims and their families and a fair trial and accountability for suspected perpetrators., “We reiterate our call for the international community to provide resources to assist Ukraine in securing evidence and conducting the necessary investigations into how these people died and who was responsible. Those who commit or order crimes under international law should remember: there is no statute of limitation, and justice will catch up with them. To ensure justice and reparation for victims, trials of those suspected of war crimes must adhere to international standards for fair trial.”, Background, After retaking control of Izium in Kharkiv region, the Ukrainian authorities announced that they had discovered an improvised grave site in a nearby forest where they counted more than 440 recent burials. According to Oleh Kotenko, Ukraine’s Commissioner for Missing Persons, the grave site was hastily dug to deal with numerous casualties, including from heavy shelling of the town by the Russian forces in February and March 2022. Photographs and testimonies sourced by journalists from the area are consistent with this report., Journalists reported that several wooden crosses on the graves bear names of those presumed to be buried beneath, while most have only numbers, including one on a mass grave indicating that 17 Ukrainian soldiers are buried there., Since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, Amnesty International has documented numerous serious violations of international humanitarian law (the law of war) by Russian forces, including unlawful attacks on civilians, residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, unlawful killings and other war crimes.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-mass-graves-izium-macabre-reminder-cost-russian-aggression

Update 103 - IAEA Director General Statement on Situation in Ukraine (17 Sep 2022),News and Press Release,IAEA,"Disaster Management
Recovery and Reconstruction",17 Sep 2022,"Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) is once again receiving electricity directly from the national grid after engineers repaired one of the four main external power lines that have all been damaged during the conflict, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) learnt at the site today., The restored 750 kilovolt (kV) line is now providing Europe’s largest nuclear power plant – whose last operating reactor was shut down on 11 September – with the electricity it needs for reactor cooling and other essential safety functions. After the ZNPP lost the connection to the same 750 kV line two weeks ago, it first relied on electricity produced by the plant itself and then on back-up power lines linking it to the grid through the electrical switchyard of a nearby thermal power plant., With the main line’s re-connection yesterday afternoon, the three back-up power lines are again being held in reserve. The three other main external 750 kV power lines that were lost earlier during the conflict remain down. All the ZNPP’s six reactors are in a cold shutdown state, but they still require power to maintain necessary safety functions. Since 5 September, the plant has not been providing any electricity to households, factories and others relying on it for their needs., The 750 kV line was restored on the same day as the national Ukrainian operator Energoatom said it had delivered spare parts for the repair of the ZNPP’s power lines as well as additional fuel supplies for the plant’s emergency diesel generators that can be used as a back-up power source. These spare part and fuel deliveries were confirmed by IAEA experts at the site. The ZNPP is held by Russian forces but continues to be operated by its Ukrainian personnel., A secure off-site power supply from the grid and back-up power supply systems are essential for ensuring nuclear safety and preventing a nuclear accident, even when the reactors are no longer operating. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi outlined at the beginning of the conflict., While the ZNPP’s power status has improved over the past week – in sharp contrast to earlier this month when all power lines at one stage were down and it depended on its last operating reactor for vital electricity supplies – the general situation for the plant located in the middle of a war zone remains precarious, Director General Grossi said. While there has been no recent shelling at or near the ZNPP, it continues to occur in the wider area, he said., To help stabilise the situation, the Director General has initiated consultations with the relevant parties aimed at the urgent establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone at the ZNPP. Earlier this month, he established a continuous IAEA presence at the ZNPP after leading a team of experts to the site.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/update-103-iaea-director-general-statement-situation-ukraine-17-sep-2022

"The Black Sea Grain Initiative: What it is, and why it’s important for the world [EN/RU]",News and Press Release,UN News,Food and Nutrition,16 Sep 2022,"Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, exports of grain from Ukraine, as well as food and fertilizers from Russia, have been significantly hit. The disruption in supplies pushed soaring prices even higher and contributed to a global food crisis. The Black Sea Grain Initiative, brokered by the United Nations and Türkiye, was set up to reintroduce vital food and fertilizer exports from Ukraine to the rest of the world. Here are some key points to understand., Ukraine, one of the world’s largest grain exporters, normally supplies around 45 million tonnes of grain to the global market every year but, following Russia’s invasion of the country, in late February 2022, mountains of grains built up in silos, with ships unable to secure safe passage to and from Ukrainian ports, and land routes unable to compensate., This contributed to a jump in the price of staple foods around the world. Combined with increases in the cost of energy, developing countries were pushed to the brink of debt default and increasing numbers of people found themselves on the brink of famine., On 22 July, the UN, the Russian Federation, Türkiye and Ukraine agreed the Black Sea Grain Initiative, at a signing ceremony in the Turkish capital, Istanbul., The deal allowed exports from Ukraine of grain, other foodstuffs, and fertilizer, including ammonia, to resume through a safe maritime humanitarian corridor from three key Ukrainian ports: Chornomorsk, Odesa, and Yuzhny/Pivdennyi, to the rest of the world., To implement the deal, a Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) was established in Istanbul, comprising senior representatives from the Russian Federation, Türkiye, Ukraine, and the United Nations., According to procedures issued by the JCC, vessels wishing to participate in the Initiative will undergo inspection off Istanbul to ensure they are empty of cargo, then sail through the maritime humanitarian corridor to Ukrainian ports to load. The corridor is established by the JCC and monitored 24/7 to ensure the safe passage of vessels. Vessels on the return journey will also be inspected at the inspection area off Istanbul., Shipments monitored by the Initiative began leaving from 1st August. By the end of the month, over 100 ships, laden with more than one million tonnes of grain and other foodstuffs, had left Ukraine. By mid-September the JCC reported that some three million tonnes had left Ukraine, signalling positive progress. It is hoped that, eventually, up to five million tonnes will be exported monthly., According to UN figures, 51 per cent of the cargo so far (as of mid-September?) has been corn, 25 per cent wheat, 11 per cent sunflower products, six per cent rapeseed, five per cent barley, one per cent soya beans, and one per cent other foodstuffs., A 25 per cent of the cargo has gone to low and lower-middle income countries. Egypt (8 per cent), India and Iran (4 per cent each), Bangladesh, Kenya and Sudan (2 per cent each), Lebanon, Yemen, Somalia, Djibouti (1 per cent each), and Tunisia (less than one per cent), This includes UN-chartered vessels delivering humanitarian food assistance – World Food Programme (WFP) purchased wheat – to the Horn of Africa and Yemen. Two UN-chartered ships have already left Ukraine, while another two are expected soon. WFP had so far purchased 120,000 metric tonnes of wheat to support humanitarian relief in the Horn of Africa, Yemen and Afghanistan., The first WFP-chartered vessel docked in Djibouti on 30 August to support the drought response in the Horn of Africa. A second UN-chartered vessel, loaded with 37,500 metric tons of wheat, sailed on 30 August and docked in Türkiye on 3 September, where the wheat will be milled to flour., This flour will then be loaded onto a different ship that will head to Yemen to support the World Food Programme’s humanitarian response there. The third and fourth WFP-chartered vessels will also supply wheat to relief operations., Some 25 per cent of grain has gone to upper-middle income countries – including Türkiye, China and Bulgaria; and 50 per cent to high-income countries like Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Republic of Korea, Romania, Germany, France, Greece, Ireland, and Israel., The UN points out that all of the grain coming out of the Ukrainian ports thanks to the Initiative benefits people in need, as it helps to calm markets, and limit food price inflation., All ship movements can be found on the Black Sea Grain Initiative website, which also contains useful facts and figures., There are strong signs that the Initiative is succeeding in one of its key aims, getting food prices down., At a press briefing in mid-September, Rebeca Grynspan, the Secretary-General of the UN trade agency, known as UNCTAD, and Amir Abdulla, the UN Coordinator for the Black Sea Grain Initiative welcomed the fact prices have come down five months in a row: the Food Price Index has decreased nearly 14 per cent from its peak in March of this year., Mr. Abdulla explained that falling prices meant that those who had been hoarding grain, in the hope of selling at a greater profit, were now selling, which meant that there is now more food supply in the markets, leading to further price drops. Ms. Grynspan, who is also coordinator of the UN global Task Team set up to help support countries deal with the triple economic shocks worsened by the effects of the war in Ukraine, pointed out that this is making a huge difference in a global cost of living crisis., Globally, a record 345 million people in more than 80 countries are currently facing acute food insecurity, while up to 50 million people in 45 countries are at risk of being pushed into famine without humanitarian support., In August, WFP Executive Director David Beasley declared getting the Black Sea Ports open to be “the single most important thing we can do right now to help the world’s hungry”. He warned that, whilst this would not, on its own, stop world hunger, bringing Ukrainian grain back on global markets would improve the chance of preventing the global food crisis from spiralling even further., The UN is acutely aware that keeping shipments sailing smoothly out of Ukrainian ports will require the continued collaboration of Ukraine and Russia. Mr. Abdulla has praised the “collaborative spirit” between the parties to the Initiative. He also noted the special role that Türkiye and the UN are playing in keeping the process moving., However, with no clear end in sight to the war, the future is uncertain., The current Initiative may extend beyond its initial 120 days after the signing date of 22 July, if parties so choose. Thoughts at the JCC team in Istanbul are already turning to the extension of the deal. Mr. Abdulla remains positive, expressing his hope that “with the UN's mediation efforts, it won't really be a matter for discussion”.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/black-sea-grain-initiative-what-it-and-why-its-important-world-enru

Water Sanitation Hygiene",28 Aug 2022,"François Grunewald, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, Groupe URD conducted a real-time evaluation of the humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine, in order to record lessons from the initial response, and to inform later decision-making., Responses to key questions in the terms of reference, Key question 1. Resource mobilisation and needs evaluation: what procedures were used to analyse context, resource mobilisation and needs evaluation?, This war in Europe, arising from flagrant aggression and engendering significant humanitarian needs, calls for a major resource mobilisation effort. Resources were initially mobilised by the Ukrainian population itself, and its diaspora. They collected, sent and distributed considerable quantities of food, basic supplies and medicines. Then civil society in Europe and North America also sent both financial aid and aid in kind. While it is unfortunately difficult to quantify this vast effort at solidarity, it is clear that the effort continues at a significant level, even if it seems to be diminishing. Aid was extremely quick to arrive both to assist people leaving the country for exile, mainly in zones close to the frontiers, and to assist the interior of the country. t came as a response to requests, not linked to any ‘needs evaluation’. The international aid that has been mobilised is also very significant, reaching hitherto unprecedented levels. The latest ‘flash’ appeal raised some $4.7 billion, based on a needs analysis carried out by the humanitarian clusters, and using the REACH tool. Part of the response to identified needs is still under-funded, particularly those needs which would normally be the responsibility of the municipalities: the repair of essential infrastructure to enable the population to survive. At present, there are very limited financial resources, and few systems, available to support the municipalities., Key question 2. Flexibility: given the differences between operational realities in different situations, and also their tendency to evolve, what measures have already been taken or are still necessary to adapt to the new working environment?, International aid had difficulty in getting off the ground. It had to deal with a functioning state that was characterised at one and the same time by cumbersome features inherited from the Soviet period, and by an impressive level of modernization, sustained by the strong development of IT underpinning administrative procedures and a large part of society. The difficulty for the international aid sector was accentuated by uncertainty as to how the conflict would develop, by security problems and by the diversity of situations on the ground. The NGOs, however, had access to their own funds, or access to flexible sources of funding and were therefore quickly able to launch ‘no regret’ initiatives., We observe here a classic phenomenon which we have already described in other contexts, that is the existence of a centre of action where a majority of the humanitarian, or aid, actors are concentrated, where it is relatively easy to respond to critical needs; and peripheral areas where the dangers are more significant and needs not so obviously concentrated in one place. Characteristically, in such areas of Ukraine, for a long time only a limited number of actors were able to function, given the difficulties: ICRC, MSF, and some other NGOs, particularly French ones (ACTED, Solidarités International, PUI, Triangle, etc). Much of the work can be done through interaction with Ukrainian actors or groups of volunteers. There is a continuing process of negotiation with donors, to enlarge the scope for flexibility. This scope for flexibility is very often a key factor when negotiating contracts, and broadly entails agreeing on definitions that are flexible enough to limit the need for frequent contract amendments, which always take up a great deal of time. A close dialogue with donors is essential, so that they remain aware of needs, and of any changes., Key question 3. ‘Localisation’: how did Ukrainian NGOs work, including those in the diaspora, and the churches? How did the municipal governments and Ukrainian institutions work? How did the humanitarian organisations identify the capacity of the partners with which they were to work? How did they work with the national Ukrainian structures already in place, as well as with informal systems? What lessons were learned? Were there new ideas which might be useful in developing new approaches to the ‘localization’ of aid?, Ukrainian civil society, including citizen groups, volunteers, NGOs, churches, and also the municipalities, were motivated to respond by drawing on a dynamic of ‘resistance’, on a global scale, combining the ideas of solidarity, humanitarian assistance, citizen responsibility and support for the country's defence effort. Some of the international aid agencies were made extremely uneasy by this combination, being themselves very observant of humanitarian principles. Work is further complicated in a civil society which, while very dynamic, is also very disparate and still not highly organised; and by the international aid agencies’ procedures for scrutinising aid for fear of corruption, or of its being siphoned off by terrorist networks. The difficulties are accentuated by dealings, often inadequate, with the municipalities., Key question 4. Technical adaptation. Aid agencies face numerous challenges in the specific contexts of Ukraine and countries receiving Ukrainian refugees. The agencies are more used to working in developing countries, and in rural areas. The most recent experiencesin contexts similar to Ukraine were in the Balkans, Chechnya and the towns of Syria. How did the humanitarian agencies adapt their knowledge and experience to this crisis?, It continues to be difficult to deliver humanitarian aid in urban contexts, where the supply and delivery of electricity, water, heat, or the maintenance of telecommunications - issues where classic humanitarian aid is not equipped to respond at scale - are just as important as meeting individual basic needs for food, hygiene, etc.
In numerous areas, the complexity of meeting basic needs depends upon complicated equations, balancing what can or must be done by providing financial assistance - unconditional financial transfers - and what depends necessarily on aid in kind., National systems for such transfers (DIAA, Ipo-Pamaga) have been significantly underused. Aid organisations have set up their own mechanisms, which may entail significant transaction costs. With such parallel systems in place, it became necessary, six months after the invasion, to develop a complicated process to impose coherence on them all. When donations in kind are linked to clearly defined needs, with lists of provisions or medicine - the latter confirmed by the health services - they are very useful. However, an excess of generous gifts that are nonetheless unsuitable, such as out-ofdate biomedical material, out-of-date medicines, etc, end up blocking storage facilities, and are costly to destroy or dispose of., Key question 5. Protection. The war in Ukraine and the consequent displacement of people have led to numerous problems relating to protection: violations of international human rights relating to sexual exploitation; risks for women and their children while leaving Ukraine and when arriving in neighbouring countries. There have also been psychological and social (‘psychosocial’) problems. How have humanitarian agencies responded to such issues of protection, and what have they learnt?, The international community has faced major risks arising from the widespread non-observance of international human rights in time of war: attacks on civilian areas, the use of urban warfare entailing razing areas to the ground, egregious assaults on the rights of prisoners of war, etc. The ICRC should command total support. Many aid agencies, such as UNICEF and the HCR as well as NGOs, particularly Ukrainian human rights NGOs, have placed a strong focus on dealing with human trafficking and gender-based violence, both in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries. We should note the significant efforts made by the municipalities, and by NGOs like the DRC and the Ukrainian human rights NGOs, to help people with administrative procedures needed to ensure they have the correct paperwork, including for access to aid and services., Key question 6. Coordination. Coordination is known to save lives, and to guarantee the means of subsistence. How did the complex group of agencies and actors, including different national authorities, UN agencies, donors, etc, work? What are the principal lessons to be drawn from this type of situation?, Significant efforts were made to set up a classic system of coordination, under the aegis of OCHA, relying particularly on the cluster system. There were increasingly numerous meetings which led to the multiplication of working groups and subgroups (‘task teams’). ost took place by video link. Unfortunately, the Ukrainian agencies, from both government and civil society, were kept at some distance. This meant that there was very little ‘area-based coordination’, that is the establishment of coordination mechanisms based in the affected areas. Such local, intersectoral coordination, implemented through municipal structures or integrated into such structures as soon as possible, offers the only means to ensure a flexible systemic response. Flexibility is essential in a complex context where big issues may to some extent be predicted in advance (military action in the East or the South, the question of energy supplies as winter approaches, etc), but in an immediate context of extreme uncertainty (where will attacks be launched, which areas are going to be bombed, etc?) The best, most effective response, to ensure that aid is adapted to sudden changes, is for analysis and decision-making to take place locally, taking all sectors into account.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/real-time-evaluation-humanitarian-response-ukraine-july-24th-august-18th-2022

And with the Ukrainian Government reportedly regaining control over most of the eastern Kharkivska oblast and parts of the southern Khersonska oblast, there was also increasing concern for the needs of the people living in these newly accessible territories and how best to support them with winter approaching. UN agencies and partners on the ground are working closely with local authorities to determine needs and arrange deliveries of life-saving humanitarian assistance to the worst-affected areas., The main fighting continued in the eastern Donetska oblast, where more than 100 civilian casualties – 34 killed and 72 more injured – were reported following missile strikes and shelling on both sides of the front line during the weekend, 9-11 September. They included 29 casualties just on 10 September in Government-controlled areas (GCA) of the oblast, with the cities of Bakhmut, Krasnohorivka and Pokrovsk most seriously impacted. In non-Government-controlled areas (NGCA), 35 civilian casualties were reported on 9 September in Donetsk city and Horlivka. Commenting on the tragic milestone of 200 days of the war, Donetska Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko reported that some 78,000 houses and apartment buildings had so far been damaged or destroyed in the GCA of the oblast, as well as almost 600 kindergartens and schools. In NGCA, it was reported that almost 7,000 residential buildings had so far been damaged, 300 educational facilities and hundreds of other civilian objects and infrastructure., A similar reckoning took place in Kharkivska oblast – both as a result of ongoing shelling and through the assessments being conducted in newly accessible areas, which had been beyond Government control for half a year. More than 30 new civilian casualties were reported over the weekend – mainly in Kharkiv city on 9 September, when 9 people were reportedly injured in the shelling. Meanwhile, a city councillor from Izium, which has been among the cities reported to be retaken by Ukraine, said on 12 September that an estimated 1,000 residents had died there, and 80 per cent of the city’s infrastructure had been destroyed. He described an urgent need for health care and medicine and added that, while most of the 30,000- plus residents who had fled the city were now looking forward to returning, “the situation with critical infrastructure is very difficult.” Most of the now-former NGCA of Kharkivska oblast was reportedly heavily impacted by the war – with water, electricity and other basic services interrupted and much of the land mined, impeding the delivery of aid. A subsequent humanitarian security report issued by an international NGO said that three civilians were killed and one other injured in a landmine explosion on 12 September on a dirt road near the village of Makarove, north of Kharkiv., Further, on 11 September, the Ukrainian authorities and a humanitarian partner reported that missile strikes had damaged a combined power and heating plant in Kharkiv and resulted in interruptions to both the electricity and water supply – not only in Kharkivska but also in Donetska oblast, north-eastern Sumska oblast, central Dnipropetrovska and Poltavska oblasts, and south-eastern Zaporizka oblast. Four energy workers were reported to have been killed in the attacks, and three more injured as thousands of households were left without power and water. Work reportedly continued in the following days to repair infrastructure and restore services, and the Ukrainian Government condemned what it described as the deliberate targeting of critical civilian infrastructure. At the time of writing, the water and power supply had been largely restored in the affected oblasts. Then, on 14 September, at least seven missiles were reported to have struck and damaged the Karachunivske Reservoir dam on the outskirts of Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovska oblast, reportedly causing flooding of residential buildings and interruptions in the water supply., There meanwhile continued to be daily reports of attacks elsewhere in Ukraine resulting in civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure, reportedly including in the city of Mykolaiv and the southern Mykolaivska oblast – which reportedly has not been shelled on only 29 out of 200 days of the war so far – and in Sumska oblast, where a recent increase in missile strikes and shelling was reported., Concerning the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) – located in the NGCA of Zaporizka oblast – the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in its latest update from 13 September, said that, despite progress on repairs to power infrastructure, the overall situation “remains precarious.” IAEA informed that, while Ukrainian personnel had made progress repairing power lines to provide the plant with the external electricity it needs for cooling and other safety functions, all six reactors were currently shut down, and ZNPP’s four main external power lines were also down – so that the plant was not providing electricity to households, factories and other users. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, speaking on 12 September, reiterated his call for the establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone aroundZNPP.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-situation-report-14-sep-2022-enukru

Ukraine: MSF helps provide physiotherapy for people with war wounds,News and Press Release,MSF,Health,14 Sep 2022,"As conflict continues, specialized physiotherapy is emerging as a major need in the country. Though the exact number is unknown, thousands of people injured in the war are believed to need physical rehabilitation in Ukraine, requiring a range of specific health services such as diagnosis, treatment, surgery, assistive devices, and physiotherapy., Since July, MSF has been working in the Central Hospital of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Kyiv and the Research Institute for Rehabilitation of People with Disabilities in Vinnytsia, which respectively have 60 and 70 beds for patients with traumatic injuries. MSF physiotherapists are providing bedside training to the hospital staff, working with patients and contributing to the development of local skills at the same time., ""In Kyiv, it's a very big hospital where war-wounded patients arrive,"" said Diana Galindo, MSF medical coordinator. ""They receive patients from the east and the south, where the first surgeries are done, and then they are sent to Kyiv to continue their care. We see that most of them are amputees, and they are presenting now with heavier handicaps than if they were treated properly with rehabilitation."", When high-quality physiotherapy is provided early enough, patients can avoid more severe disabilities such as permanently losing their mobility. However, physical rehabilitation is not a well-established sector of the Ukrainian health care system, and there aren't enough experienced and skilled specialists to meet the high level of need., By working within Ukrainian hospitals, MSF is helping increase the local capacity to provide physical rehabilitation. In July and August, more than 110 patients received physical rehabilitation as part of MSF's collaboration with the two hospitals. While MSF is not involved in surgery in these hospitals or in the fitting of the prostheses, our staff support patients once they have been fitted with prostheses, helping them recover their mobility.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-msf-helps-provide-physiotherapy-people-war-wounds

"Across Ukraine, volunteers fight diabetes with donated supplies, education and dedication",News and Press Release,Direct Relief,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",15 Sep 2022,"War in Ukraine complicates management of diabetes, but one group is working to improve access to testing supplies and support., By Sophia Kishkovsky, Direct Relief, “Battle.” “Soldiers.” “Victory.” When members of the Ukrainian Diabetes Federation (UDF) talk about living with diabetes, they use the language of war., If it’s a war, Valentina Ocheretenko is on the front lines. A theoretical physicist, she devoted 45 years to caring for a daughter with diabetes and founded UDF during Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s perestroika reforms. It was a pioneering non-governmental organization as the country moved towards independence., And as literal bombs fall on Ukraine, Ocheretenko is raising up an army of staff and volunteers to continue the battle against diabetes – with the help of a $150,000 grant from Direct Relief. These activists are doing everything from distributing glucose monitoring equipment to affected areas of Ukraine, to focusing on education efforts and galvanizing people with diabetes, to advocating for a new treatment center and other essential services. The goal is to see as many people as possible through the war – and to continue their work after it ceases., The 2021 Diabetes Atlas of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the organization that linked Direct Relief to the UDF, counted 2.3 million people with diabetes in Ukraine, 230,000 of whom are dependent on insulin. The Russian invasion has displaced many of them across the country, trapped them in Russian-occupied territory, or sent them abroad as refugees. All of this makes caring for people with diabetes – and distributing the medical supplies that keep them alive – even more complicated., “A BEAST EVEN MORE FRIGHTENING THAN DIABETES”, Children with diabetes “have a lifelong diagnosis that they will not be able to handle without a battle,” said Galina Michno, who recently started a UDF branch in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Kharkiv has been under bombardment from the outset of the invasion, and Michno is coordinating medical care and aid for people of all ages confronting diabetes in dire circumstances. “Now we have a beast even more frightening than diabetes. That is war,” she said., One of Ocheretenko’s longtime associates, Svetlana Galayeva, recalled that education and rehabilitation were priorities before the war for children living in Odesa, a Ukrainian port city famous for its joie de vivre – and now one of Russia’s main strategic targets., Galayeva was drawn to the movement when her son, now an adult, developed Type 1 diabetes at the age of six. She recalls special education sessions for children with diabetes from Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus at Artek, a famous Soviet-era summer camp in Crimea that was run by Ukraine after 1991 until Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula in 2014., After Russia invaded on February 24, the world became a medical minefield for people with diabetes. For Ocheretenko, the threat of the war itself was less alarming than its impact on the people her organization works to support., “I had no fear from the first minute,” she said. “There were explosions outside my windows. My first thought was to have water and prepare food for my daughter…Then the calls started coming in with questions. People were used to our help. Many asked for advice, especially those who had fled abroad.”, A PATH FORWARD IN WARTIME, When Russia began its attack on Ukraine, Ocheretenko received instant offers of support from diabetes associations in Kazakhstan and Georgia. But formerly close colleagues in Russia immediately broke all ties. She turned down an offer of insulin supplies from Direct Relief – those are going to the Ministry of Health – saying that the UDF cannot ensure temperature and other logistical controls. Instead, UDF is distributing glucose monitors and testing strips donated by Direct Relief., “Thanks to Direct Relief, adults received glucose monitors for free for the first time,” Ocheretenko said during a Zoom call from Kyiv, interrupted, for a change, not by air raid sirens but by a thunderstorm., As of August 15, Nadezhda Karapysh, Ocheretenko’s top Kyiv volunteer, had mailed packages of OneTouch Select blood glucose strips (donated to Direct Relief by LifeScan for the benefit of Ukraine) to a carefully verified list of recipients across Ukraine, from the Chernihiv region to Melitopol before it was occupied, and to soldiers on the frontlines. Karpysh became a volunteer 20 years ago when her grandson was diagnosed with diabetes. Now he is fighting to defend Ukraine., In a comment on the UDF’s Facebook page, a doctor expressed profound gratitude for the test strips and described the difficulties of treatment for people with diabetes., “Thank you for taking care of our patients,” he wrote. “Thanks to you, I received test strips for the first time in my life. I rejoiced to the point of tears for them. Endocrinological assistance for residents of rural areas is at zero! There are no screenings, we detect the disease at the stage of complications!”, At the same time, in mid-July one of the wartime benefits for people with diabetes was rolled back. By government order, an insulin copay of 15 percent was re-instituted for some categories of patients. “Here we go again,” wrote Ochertenko in a Facebook post. “People often don’t even have enough money for food,” as the war approached its six-month mark., In August, Direct Relief delivered a seven-week supply of long-acting insulin that it had secured from the Eli Lilly Company for distribution around the country by the Ministry of Health., “DROPPED TO ZERO”, Ocheretenko is dealing with a collapse in services – when she was first interviewed for this story in late June, the major city of Dnipro did not have a single endocrinologist, while in other regions the few endocrinologists were overwhelmed., But she’s also concerned about problems that existed long before the war and will likely continue after it ends – particularly those related to diabetes education, a major focus of UDF., “My firm conviction is that it doesn’t depend on the type of insulin,” Ocheretenko said. “Even the most modern kind won’t work well if a person is not taught” about how to use it and how to control diabetes., One of Ocheretenko’s main criticisms of Ukraine’s healthcare reform is that it shut down a nationwide network of diabetes schools that she had helped build up. “Within several years the level of knowledge dropped to zero,” compounding the socio-economic factors that are the main cause of diabetes in Ukraine. The UDF is developing a new educational program called Dialeader., “WE ARE HELPING TO BRING VICTORY”, Before the war, Michno had no personal experience with diabetes, but had an invaluable background in building networks. She had become a successful Mary Kay cosmetics representative in the 1990s when the American firm became popular in post-Soviet countries. “We had American training sessions in sales and marketing,” she said. “Then we needed beauty.”, Now, she said, “we are helping to bring victory.”, As Russian missiles rained down on Kharkiv, thousands of residents sheltered in the metro. Michno and her daughter started by handing out healthy snacks there., She and her family took refuge at a family dacha, or country home, in the region, where she is developing a diabetes education network and connecting people with diabetes to treatment, with a focus on the elderly and children. Michno says “the entire country has ended up in a horrific situation” and children with diabetes “in an even more horrific” one., The rural area where Michno is now living and working is sheltering a large number of displaced persons from Kharkiv and the Donbas region who were unable to leave the country. Many of them have diabetes; there is no functioning treatment center for preventative endocrinology and diabetes care; and long distances and lack of money make it increasingly difficult to get any care., Michno is seeking funding to create a treatment center and organize educational events, psychological support, and activities to support people with diabetes and their families. She is also experimenting with social media platforms as a way to unite people with diabetes. (Instagram does not work for those over 45, she said.), “AT WAR THEIR WHOLE LIFE, LIKE SOLDIERS”, Until recently, Odesa had not been hit hard, and the local UDF was helping Kharkiv., There were 344 children with diabetes in Odesa before the invasion, and 178 as of mid-June, when Direct Relief spoke with Nadezhda Goncharenko, deputy head of the city’s health department. Many children had left the country with their mothers early in the invasion, and many elderly people remained, or sought shelter in what seemed to be safe cities, including Odesa., Disruption of medical supplies can be traumatic. Goncharenko says there are occasional problems with obtaining “imported insulin and especially with analogs” and that there is still a significant need for glucose meters and testing strips, as well as needles for insulin injections pens. “Humanitarian aid has helped a lot” with maintaining insulin supplies, she said., Galayeva said her son’s diabetes has resulted in leadership skills useful in wartime. An IT specialist, he now runs Odesa’s UDF branch, while she continues to help as a volunteer., People with diabetes “are more stress resistant since they are at war their whole life, like soldiers,” she said, and many are fighting now. “My son has friends who are healthy. He can gather them together, explain things and they understand.”, “People with diabetes have shorter lives in peacetime as well,” said Ocheretenko in a follow-up email. “We’ll probably never find out how many among the dead had diabetes,” since it is harder for doctors to treat people with diabetes when they suffer trauma or injury., She compares people with diabetes to tightrope walkers who are constantly fighting to maintain their balance “with no days off,” at risk of being knocked off by a squall at any moment., “War has a cruel face, and it is doubly cruel” to people with diabetes, wrote Ocheretenko. She signed off with the hashtag #NO_WAR.",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/across-ukraine-volunteers-fight-diabetes-donated-supplies-education-and-dedication
"6 months of aid in Ukraine – DRA partners support thousands with immediate relief, but millions remain in need",News and Press Release,Dorcas,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Shelter and Non-Food Items",15 Sep 2022,"After 6 months of war in Ukraine, millions of Ukrainians remain in immediate need of support. Across the country, the Dutch Relief Alliance (DRA) has worked together with local partners as part of its Joint Response to provide food and non-food items, multi-purpose cash assistance, and mental healthcare and psychosocial support to vulnerable households affected by the conflict., In March, the situation across the country was opaque. There was a huge humanitarian need, but it was unclear where this need was concentrated and where help would be most effective. DRA partners hit the ground running, supporting people where they could. After a few weeks, the partners mapped where they could most effectively help out, scaling up relief efforts. Regrettably, violence continues in parts of the country. Elsewhere, communities have settled into a sort of status quo. The basic needs remain: millions of displaced people need all kinds of help, and the country needs a shift towards reconstruction., Multi-purpose cash to meet urgent needs, Save the Children works together with Avalyst as part of the Ukraine Joint Response. Across the country, in areas including Dutska, Luhanska, Dnipropetrovska and Vinnytsia, Save the Children and Avalyst provide multi-purpose cash and non-food item kits. In the past 6 months, they were able to meet the immediate needs of more than 500 households., Avalyst took on the responsibility of registering households, creating an inventory of their needs. After registration, Save the Children took care of cash disbursement, enabling families to determine their own spending on their immediate needs., Next to non-restricted cash, Avalyst also distributed non-food items, handing Ukrainians in need things like basic hygiene materials, textile, and household goods. In this way, Avalyst and Save the Children help refugees and households to re-establish a semblance of their home routines., By working together and communicating clearly with local communities, Save the Children and Avalyst have been able to adjust their aid provision to what these communities need. These strong links resulted in more efficient distribution and helped to avoid wasted goods., Caritas Ukraine, Cordaid’s local partner in the Joint Response, has chosen to focus on distributing non-food items and hygiene kits. In areas around Dnipro and Kyiv, as well as in Ivano-Frankivsk, Caritas found that internally displaced people were most urgently in need of physical items that they lacked access to. Through its dioceses across these areas, Caritas provided emergency food packages, drinking water, warm kits and medical supplies., Displacement, rising prices, growing needs, In Muchacova a town of 75.000 inhabitants where New Beginning works, an additional of 26.000 refugees from other parts of Ukraine have arrived – including many families with vulnerable children. New Beginning has been a partner of Dorcas for years, focusing on marginalised children. With the start of the Ukraine Joint Response in March, Dorcas and New Beginning have strengthened their partnership to meet the basic needs of refugees, providing food parcels and psychosocial support., Internally displaced people (IDPs) get to know New Beginning when they come for food support or clothing. Through this first connection New Beginning is able to ask them their needs. IDPs are welcomed to join activities that incorporate elements of psychosocial support. Only 2% of IDPs ask for psychosocial support themselves because of feelings of shame and the taboo on mental health struggles. Good experiences with the children’s clubs lead IDPs to encourage their friends to participate, enabling more children to receive psychosocial support., New Beginning offers a range of social activities, like a 5-day camp for children and a weekly children’s’ club. While the children play and take part in activities as part of the club, the parents – mainly mothers – go upstairs to have their own meeting and build connections with each other., According to Alexandra, the Director of New Beginning, “if parents are at rest and show peaceful behaviour, children also develop healthy habits and feel less anxious. We focus firstly on the basic needs and on the parents – then by extension the children will recover. New Beginning has the aim to offer a new beginning. We follow our desire to help the people.”, Lasting partnerships, While the Ukraine Joint Response will come to an end in early September after 6 months, the partnerships established by working together will endure. The conflict rages on and needs remain. Reconstruction of communities, both in cities and in rural areas, will be a focus for the next months and years to return a sense of normality to the lives of Ukrainians., The peer-to-peer approach under the Joint Response, characterised by trust and equal partnership, has already resulted in ideas and proposals for further cooperation after the end of the Joint Response. Working side by side to rapidly scale the response, overcoming together the myriad obstacles along the way, strengthened the abilities of both side of the partnership. Despite the formal end of the Joint Response, exchange of information, knowledge and best-practices between the Dutch and local partners will continue. Where possible, the DRA partners will support Caritas, Avalyst, and New Beginning, alongside other local partners, in their efforts to reconstruct their country., The Dutch Relief Alliance Acute Joint Response in Ukraine is led by Dorcas in partnership with Cordaid and Save the Children, alongside a number of local humanitarian organisations. The work of the DRA in Ukraine is made possible in partnership with the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs., 15 September 2022",https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/6-months-aid-ukraine-dra-partners-support-thousands-immediate-relief-millions-remain-need
