The reported casualties make it the deadliest day since the military seized power on 1 February., The Civil Disobedience Movement's impact on essential and social services is deeply felt across the country, with medical service functioning at their minimum, no COVID-19 testing and treatment capacity, banks closed and ATMs often not functioning, supplies partly stopped with some shortages of essential items and sharp price increases in different parts of the country (from 10% to 25% accordingly to DG ECHO's partners)., Humanitarian assistance is also severely impacted by the dysfunctionality of key services, such as government administrations, banks and supplies. Partners reported important delays in food and cash distribution. Food insecurity in the country is therefore expected to rise.

"Mu Traw District Short Update: The destruction of old ordnance by the Tatmadaw results in UXO contamination in Bu Tho Township, December 2020",Situation Report,KHRG,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",26 Feb 2021,"This Short Update describes events that occurred in Bu Tho Township, Mu Traw District in December 2020 and January 2021. On December 29th 2020, the Tatmadaw[1] destroyed old ordnance on land belonging to a local farmer without his consent, resulting in UXO [unexploded ordnance] contamination. Although the land owner asked the soldiers to clear the area of UXO, they did not do so until late January 2021.[2], On December 19th 2020, the Tatmadaw Maintenance Unit #642 under Hpapun Operations Command destroyed old ordnance [by detonating it] right beside a local villager’s paddy field in H--- village, Meh Klaw village tract,[3] Bu Tho Township, Mu Traw District. The land owner is Saw L---.[4] According to him, the Tatmadaw had already destroyed old ordnance on his land in January 2020., The Tatmadaw did not inform Saw L--- in advance nor ask for his permission to destroy the ordnance on his land. On the day of the incident, the owner begged the soldiers not to destroy the ordnance on his paddy field, but outside of it. A Tatmadaw soldier replied that since nearby areas are bushy, they would do it beside the farm. However, they ultimately detonated the ordnance right beside the paddy field’s embankment, less than one foot [30 cm] away from the farm., Saw L--- then told the Tatmadaw soldiers to take away or destroy all the pieces of ordnance that had not exploded [but they did not do it immediately]. They left behind unexploded mortar shells, RPG-7 [40 mm rockets] and other pieces of ordnance. Saw L--- was therefore concerned for his security because of the presence of [unexploded] ordnance on his land. According to an update provided by a KHRG researcher on February 24th 2021, the Tatmadaw eventually cleared the area of unexploded ordnance in late January 2021.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/mu-traw-district-short-update-destruction-old-ordnance-tatmadaw-results-uxo

Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction",28 Feb 2021,"Introduction, This Field Report analyses information collected by KHRG field researchers during the period between July and December 2020., As the COVID-19[1] pandemic entered into the second wave of infections in August, rural communities in Southeast Myanmar faced new and increased restrictions that impacted their livelihood situation. Unable to access their plantations because of local lockdowns, sell their cash crops and goods, or find work as day labourers, many rural villagers are struggling to find alternatives to provide for their families. Although some financial and material aid is being provided by the Myanmar government, the Karen National Union (KNU),[2] and other organisations, that aid remains uneven in its distribution, often failing to reach those most in need. Access to education has also been heavily impacted by the second wave of COVID-19. Ongoing school closures in most areas, and policy and procedural changes for schools that do remain open have raised concerns among parents about increased school dropouts and the educational future of their children. Access to healthcare remains limited, with healthcare workers unable to access some areas, and villagers often unable to travel to the clinics closest to them. Several positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported in KHRG’s operational area. With limited access to testing and medical services, local villages are often left to figure out on their own how to best handle and contain the situation., The Tatmadaw[3] maintained a strong presence in the northernmost KNU-defined districts over the reporting period, and kept supplying troops, weapons and ammunition to its army camps. It also resumed military road construction works in Kler Lwee Htoo (Nyaunglebin) and Mu Traw (Hpapun) districts,[4] leading to an increase in tensions and sporadic fighting with the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA).[5] In December, the security situation in Meh Wai, Mu Traw District deteriorated dramatically after repeated Tatmadaw incursions into areas controlled by the KNU. The resulting skirmishes between the KNLA and the Tatmadaw forced dozens of households to flee their village. Fighting reportedly spread to nearby village tracts[6] and continued in early 2021. KHRG also documented several instances of indiscriminate shelling by the Tatmadaw on civilian areas in Kler Lwee Htoo and Mu Traw districts. These incidents resulted in casualties and further displacement; and also damaged livelihood areas, houses and water distribution installations in at least one village., KHRG continued to receive information about sexual violence against women. It documented four instances of rape during the reporting period: two against children and two against adult women. Although all those cases were reported to either local leaders or the Karen National Police Force (KNPF),[7] none of the perpetrators had been formally convicted under rape charges at the time of drafting. Local authorities and law enforcement often struggled to establish the facts in the absence of witnesses or confession, resulting in lengthy investigations or the dropping of rape charges. This suggests that limited investigation capabilities are one of the main barriers preventing survivors from accessing justice. In addition, some of these cases confirmed the tendency to resort to compensation to settle sexual violence cases in Southeast Myanmar. They also highlighted other barriers to justice, such as a lack of legal awareness among village authorities and weak rule of law., Lastly, KHRG documented three killing cases and one instance of forced labour.[8] Five civilians, including four children were also injured in the explosion of unexploded ordnance over the reporting period. This highlights that remnants of war continue to pose an unacceptable threat to villagers in some areas. In parallel, natural disasters have translated into livelihood difficulties for villagers reliant on small-scale farming in Dooplaya and Mu Traw districts; while entire communities had to leave their villages due to floods in Mergui-Tavoy District. In Kler Lwee Htoo District, large-scale gold mining operations along the Klaw Myaw, Puh Loh Kloh and Kaw Ka Loh Kloh rivers have resulted in water pollution, thus threatening the livelihoods of riverside communities. Reports from Mergui-Tavoy District also showed that ethnic villagers from remote areas still struggle to get ID cards due to discrimination from Myanmar government staff and difficulties in obtaining supporting documentation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/southeast-myanmar-field-report-covid-19-armed-conflict-killings-and-sexual-violence
UN Human Rights Office urges military to halt violence against peaceful protestors across Myanmar: Comment by UN Human Rights Office Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani on Myanmar [EN/MY],News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,28 Feb 2021,"Geneva: “We strongly condemn the escalating violence against protests in Myanmar and call on the military to immediately halt the use of force against peaceful protestors., Throughout the day, in several locations throughout the country, police and military forces have confronted peaceful demonstrations, using lethal force and less-than-lethal force that – according to credible information received by the UN Human Rights Office – has left at least 18 people dead and over 30 wounded. Deaths reportedly occurred as a result of live ammunition fired into crowds in Yangon, Dawei, Mandalay, Myeik, Bago and Pokokku. Tear gas was also reportedly used in various locations as well as flash-bang and stun grenades., The people of Myanmar have the right to assemble peacefully and demand the restoration of democracy. These fundamental rights must be respected by the military and police, not met with violent and bloody repression., Use of lethal force against non-violent demonstrators is never justifiable under international human rights norms., Since the beginning of the coup d’état in Myanmar on 1 February, the police and security forces have targeted an ever-increasing number of opposition voices and demonstrators by arresting political officials, activists, civil society members, journalists and medical professionals. Today alone, police have detained at least 85 medical professionals and students, as well as seven journalists, who were present at the demonstrations. Over 1,000 individuals have been arbitrarily arrested and detained in the last month – some of whom remain unaccounted for – mostly without any form of due process, simply for exercising their human rights to freedom of opinion, expression and peaceful assembly., We reiterate our call for the immediate release of all those arbitrarily detained, including members of the democratically elected government., The international community must stand in solidarity with the protestors and all those seeking a return to democracy in Myanmar.”, ENDS, MEDIA CONTACTS, Ravina Shamdasani

More than 10,000 refugees were residing on the island as of mid-February following the most recent Government of Bangladesh-initiated relocations on February 14 and 15 that moved approximately 3,600 refugees from Cox’s Bazar District to the island, relief actors report. The Government of Bangladesh, which commenced the relocation of refugees to Bhasan Char in early December, had not permitted the UN to conduct an independent and comprehensive technical and protection assessment of the island as of mid-February. The U.S. Government (USG), alongside other donors and humanitarian partners, continues to advocate that any resettlements to Bhasan Char be fully voluntary, based on informed consent, and preceded by UN technical and protection assessments., Humanitarian Operations Continue Following Burma Military Coup, Humanitarian operations in Burma continue largely unabated following the Burmese military coup d’état against the Burmese civilian government on February 1, during which soldiers detained senior civilian government officials—including State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint—and announced a one-year state of emergency. While movement restrictions and intermittent, militaryimposed telecommunications disruptions resulted in the temporary pause of some humanitarian activities during the week of February 1, humanitarian organizations—including USG partners—had largely resumed programming supporting vulnerable households across Burma as of mid-February. In addition, mostly peaceful civilian protests in Yangon city following the change in state leadership have not disrupted humanitarian assistance. However, the ongoing civil disobedience movement has caused widespread closure of businesses, including banks, causing challenges for humanitarian agencies. The UN has released statements expressing concern regarding the coup, affirming its intent to continue lifesaving relief activities in Burma, and urging military authorities to allow for uninterrupted humanitarian access to vulnerable populations., Clashes Displace Thousands of People in Shan from December to February, Escalated hostilities between the Burmese military and non-state armed groups (NSAGs) in northern Shan State since late December have displaced thousands of individuals and resulted in several civilian casualties, according to the UN. Conflict between the Shan State Army and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army displaced an estimated 3,900 people in Kyaukme and Namtu townships between December 27 and January 15, of whom 1,000 remained displaced in Kyaukme as of January 25. Fighting between the Burmese military and NSAGs, as well as among NSAGs, continued from early to midFebruary, resulting in the displacement of more than 2,000 people in Hsipaw, Kyaukme, and Namtu townships and at least three civilian casualties, the UN reports. This recent displacement is in addition to the approximately 9,800 people who remain in protracted displacement in Shan. In response to increased protection risks due to displacement, USAID/BHA partner the International Rescue Committee (IRC) provided information on gender-based violence (GBV) service availability to more than 400 women in Shan in December, in addition to psychosocial support services and GBV awareness sessions for vulnerable populations. In addition, State/PRM partner the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) distributed more than 300 non-food item kits—consisting of blankets, mosquito nets, and plastic mats—to vulnerable households in Shan during December. An estimated 1 million people will likely require humanitarian assistance across Burma during 2021, including approximately 336,000 displaced people who remain in camps or displacement sites in eastern Bago Region and Chin, Kachin, Kayin, Rakhine, and northern Shan states, according to the UN.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/burma-and-bangladesh-regional-crisis-response-fact-sheet-3-fiscal-year-fy-2021
Q&A: A Close-up View of Myanmar’s Leaderless Mass Protests,News and Press Release,ICG,Protection and Human Rights,26 Feb 2021,"Engineers, doctors and even exotic pet owners have come together in opposition to the military coup for what are now Myanmar’s widest protests in three decades. We asked Crisis Group’s senior adviser on Myanmar, Richard Horsey, to talk about what's happening and why., What was it like to be in the streets during the protests?, It's hard to describe the incredible energy. The people who join cut across all classes of society and generations, but the preponderance are really quite young, energetic people who feel their futures have been stolen. Young people in Myanmar have grown up under the past ten years of relative liberalisation, 4G connection to the world and consistent economic growth. This period has been one of the first times in the last 50 years when a generation has felt that tomorrow will be better than today. They feel that the coup has robbed them of that hope., Another aspect perhaps not seen from the outside is how positive the energy is in the protests, the very innovative humour, people outdoing each other to have the best memes on Facebook. There's clearly been some inspiration and techniques drawn from protests in nearby Thailand and Hong Kong. But there's also a really strong element of Burmese culture present, where quick, cutting satire is a response to all kinds of things. For instance, people have been stopping their cars in the streets, pretending they've broken down, raising their bonnets and telling the police: ""I don't know what's going on, since the coup my car's CDM warning light is flashing and it's breaking down all the time!"" (CDM is the acronym for the civil disobedience movement.) Of course, the police started cracking down on this, and so the next day people started driving really, really slowly. When the police got wise to that, protestors did something else, almost slapstick humour. Someone bought a big bag of onions, but made sure there was a hole in the bottom. The person then went out onto an intersection and of course the onions started coming out of the bottom. And like in any market in Myanmar, everyone rushed over to help pick them up, and put them back in the bag. But of course, they kept coming back out. And soon there was a gridlock backed up for blocks. At the same time, they had a very serious objective, which was to frustrate the ability of the police to move around town and intercept other protests., You've been watching Myanmar and often living in the country for 25 years. Have you seen this many people on the streets before? Are the protests unifying the population?, This is clearly the biggest, most concerted protest movement that Myanmar has seen since 1988, when huge numbers of people went onto the streets to confront military rule. On 22 February this year, there were hundreds of thousands of people on the streets in Yangon, well in excess of a million across the country. There were big rallies in dozens of provincial towns and cities, including some pretty remote places., People all over the country want to participate in the popular rejection of the coup. While that of course includes restoring power to the victors in the November elections -- the National League for Democracy (NLD) of Aung San Suu Kyi -- the rejection goes far beyond that. What this coup has really done is unite the overwhelming majority of people in the country. Whether or not they supported the NLD in the elections, almost everyone can agree that they don't want the military running the country. Myanmar remains an incredibly divided society, in many different dimensions, but nobody wants to go back to the dark days of the authoritarian military past., We should be cautious about thinking it will be easy to heal those deep divisions. But there are some signs that the protest movement is beginning to bridge some of the divides. Initially, after the coup, some ethnic armed groups and political leaders were -- logically, from their perspective -- positioning themselves to see what concessions they could wrest from a military with an apparently weakened hand. This was driven by a sense that in the context of mass protests, the military could less afford armed conflict in the periphery, and was in need of whatever legitimacy it could get. Some ethnic leaders have even joined the regime's new administrative structures. But I think we're seeing a shift, as the mood of the country is expressed so clearly on the streets, including big protests in areas where minority ethnic groups are concentrated. Some ethnic armed groups and ethnic political parties have now put out quite strong statements aligning themselves with the protestors. This is partly because they see which way the wind is blowing generally in terms of popular public sentiment, and partly because they are seeking greater autonomy and know that any future political deal granting it will have to be agreed to by the majority. But their attitudes reflect more than these calculations. Increasingly it's their own ethnic populations coming out on the streets. Whatever minority ethnic populations think of the NLD, they just don't want to be under military government because it's the military governments of the past that had so severely oppressed ethnic minorities., What is the impact of the civil disobedience campaign?, The civil disobedience movement is probably having more impact on the regime than the protests. In 1988, we saw public sector workers striking and protesting, but there hasn't been this kind of broad civil disobedience movement in more recent times. During the last major instance of protests, in 2007, the movement was led by monks. Some of the people now demonstrating are civil servants, but other government staff are just not going to work or they're going to work and just not carrying out their normal functions. That is what is starting to paralyse the state. It's paralysed the banking system, even the private banks; it's paralysing the ports, transport, everything you need, in fact, to run a country., The military sees this and focuses most of its public messaging on urging people to get back to work, threatening them. When there have been cases of violence, it mostly hasn't been against the demonstrators singing and chanting on the streets, it's been to try to break up striking workers, including railway and port workers. We saw deadly violence against demonstrators trying to protect striking ship crews in the port in Mandalay, with at least ten demonstrators shot with live rounds, four of whom have died., There is trouble for the military even in the capital, Naypyitaw, which they designed and built as a protest-proof city sequestered from the rest of the country. People who live there are mostly civil servants, their families and a very small number of others. There have been huge demonstrations in Naypyidaw and that must be worrying for the generals, because that tells them that the civil service, their own administrative staff, are against them. This type of opposition is something that symbolically they can't accept, and in terms of running the country, something they can't afford., It's becoming clearer by the day that the army leadership has made a huge strategic miscalculation, and some officers may wonder if they really are all in this together. The Tatmadaw (Myanmar's military) has no history of significant institutional fissures or splits. In their professional lives, they are an indoctrinated group who are trained to believe that they are better than the rest of the population, that their role is to hold the country together. But this history of not splitting is now being tested in a way that it hasn't been in decades, perhaps ever. We should not anticipate a split, but neither should we be too confident in predicting that it won't happen., What are the crowds' feelings towards the Myanmar military?, There is a very strong pro-NLD mood in the country. But there's an even stronger and more universal anti-military mood. It's important to say that it's not necessarily against the institution itself or the individual soldiers, the antagonism is directed against the military running the country. Myanmar is a very different place than in 1988 or even when the last major demonstrations took place in 2007, with people now used to expressing themselves relatively openly, with a bigger middle class, and more connected to the world than ever before. The military is not as completely cocooned as it was in those times -- soldiers come from normal schools, officers intermarry with the national elite -- but the military nonetheless has been built up as a state within a state over decades. They have their own hospitals, their own universities, everything is a parallel structure to insulate them from the general public and weak public services. Society has changed a lot, but the military has not changed as much., The NLD's landslide in the November 2020 elections put paid to Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing's hopes of finding a coalition of anti-NLD forces that would support him politically in his ambition to become president. He was very unhappy with the outcome and immediately began claiming there was foul play (he hasn't been able to present any evidence of that). When he staged the coup on 1 February, his script ran something like this: we will do this, it won't be popular, but we have the might, we know what we're doing, we'll bring efficient administration and we'll have no trouble shutting down demonstrations. We will rally the anti-NLD forces and form a coalition to run the country. After the coup, he appointed a mix of military officers and civilians from ethnic and other non-NLD parties to the regime's State Administration Council., Where Min Aung Hlaing miscalculated is that there's a big difference between opposing the NLD and supporting authoritarian military rule. He discovered pretty quickly that few people, even among NLD opponents, were on board with the latter., Min Aung Hlaing is likely planning to convict Aung San Suu Kyi of a felony and dissolve the NLD as a party, which would mean the military could run a new election -- they have promised to do so in a year's time -- and get the result that they want. But that wouldn't solve their problem with legitimacy and public anger., Who is leading the civil unrest?, This is a leaderless movement. It is a spontaneous reaction. The vast majority of the population is against the coup and wants to show that they are against it. Clearly there are some very intelligent, politically connected and committed people involved, but the protests and civil disobedience are not led by the NLD, or a fixed committee of people, or a labour movement, or a charismatic union leader. Instead, many different groups of people have converged on the same ideas, often in chat rooms or on Facebook., What this diverse movement loses in focus and strategy, it gains in flexibility and creativity. Many participants gather by professions or pre-existing networks. You see medical staff, engineers, friendship groups, LGBT+, even owners of exotic pets or those who like to cosplay (dress up in costumes). In Mandalay, there was a big engineers' march, but it wasn't just an association of engineers bringing out its members. The call went out on Facebook for all engineers to come wearing their hard hats. As usual, volunteers watched the side of the procession, carrying string to mark the edge. But they had a problem: they had to make sure that everyone joining in was an engineer, not a provocateur or others who would be exposed as being ""fake engineers"". So everyone who wanted to participate was asked some simple engineering questions to pass before they were allowed to join in., What's happening now is almost three revolutions in one. It's the NLD supporters' revolution against the taking down of the NLD government. It's also a much broader revolution against military rule and given further impetus by deep pain resulting from the economic crisis triggered by COVID-19, which cuts across party lines; the military has done the coup at the peak of the economic pain of COVID, setting a match to a lot of dry tinder. And then there is the generational revolution in a country of gerontocratic institutions mostly run by old men. It's clear that there's a new energy driving the young people on the streets, who tend to eschew party politics and talk about their futures having been stolen by the coup., The military may be tempted to just ignore the demonstrations, wait and hope they burn themselves out. But every day that they concede the streets to the protest movement it may get bolder, stronger and gain momentum. The military may be reluctant to allow massive public displays of opposition to continue. They may be unable to abide what they no doubt view as the indignity of seeing these massive crowds chanting 'Down with Military Rule'. At a certain point, the military are likely to snap. But the problem there is that when they've tried violence up to now, it has only brought more people out onto the streets., The military have dug an extremely deep hole for themselves. It's difficult for them to negotiate with a leaderless movement, and indeed it's hard for a leaderless movement to have a coherent strategy. But all Myanmar's demonstrators do agree on one thing: the military must leave power. So how does the military get out of this, short of brutal suppression of dissent and an extended war of attrition with the people? Even if they could turn back the clock, most people aren't going to accept a return to the previous status quo. It's hard to see this going well for anyone from here, not for the country, not for the people, not for the economy and not for the military itself., What can the world do?, Governments across the world grappling with how to respond face some tough dilemmas. Particularly, Western leaders understandably want to act forcefully against the coup, including by imposing sanctions. Yet the toughest sanctions in the world could not paralyse the Myanmar state in the way that these ground-level strikes are doing. It's clear that what may tip the balance is domestic factors. It's civil disobedience, rather than anything outside actors can do., That's not to say there isn't a role for foreign governments. It is important they take a stand, demonstrate moral clarity and make sure that they aren't part of the problem. Showing solidarity is definitely important for the protest movement, and I think that they're looking very much for that. There is a role for carefully targeted sanctions directed at the generals, their assets and some of their businesses. These types of measures would signal solidarity with the people and make clear opposition to the coup. Those governments that do not already have arms embargoes in place should impose them. If they don't, they risk, given the military's track record, being complicit in violence against peaceful protesters., Still, sanctions against Myanmar will have a very marginal impact on the military's decisions. What we're essentially talking about here is Western sanctions -- governments in the region are extremely unlikely to impose their own sanctions and it will not be possible to get such measures through the UN Security Council. The military has a long experience of surviving and circumventing tough sanctions and, besides, their economic relations are not primarily with the West. All governments must avoid imposing broad, untargeted sanctions that hurt ordinary Myanmar people -- thus far, most Western leaders appear to recognise that would be counterproductive. Any changes to policies related to aid should be guided by the same principle, and a recognition that the coup and its after-effects will push huge numbers of people into poverty, increasing the need for assistance., It's important for the outside world to recognise that domestic dynamics are driving the political developments, and think carefully about how the population can be supported through a very difficult time. It's important to listen to the voices of the people (as in any crisis, there are many different views), show solidarity, and recognise and support the agency of the Myanmar people at this time. This means more engagement with protest leaders and other legitimate Myanmar voices to understand their views and to know what support and solidarity measures could be most useful.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/qa-close-view-myanmar-s-leaderless-mass-protests
"Myanmar: Military must restore democracy, allow people to protest and express themselves, say UN experts",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,26 Feb 2021,"GENEVA (26 February 2021) -- UN human rights experts* today called on the Myanmar military to immediately end the violent crackdown on countrywide peaceful protests against its coup and allow free expression., ""The people of Myanmar have the right to protest peacefully and express their discontent with the military coup,"" the experts said. ""We call on the military to refrain from using force against peaceful protests, stop using live bullets against protesters immediately and respect their right to peaceful protest,"" they added., Myanmar has seen hundreds of thousands of peaceful demonstrators take to the streets to oppose this month's military takeover and the removal of the civilian government. At least five protesters have died while many human rights defenders have been threatened and gone into hiding., The experts also expressed concern that at least 700 people had been detained since the coup, including high-profile leaders of the civilian government. Some are being kept under house arrest with no outside contact and in most cases their whereabouts are unknown. The lack of official charges or acknowledgement of detention is also disturbing, they said., ""The arbitrary detention and harassment of those voicing their dissent or organising and participating in peaceful protests must immediately end,"" the experts said., ""We are very concerned that journalists covering the protests have been arbitrarily detained and military personnel are reportedly using slingshots to fire pellets at journalists. Deliberate attacks on journalists and their arbitrary detention are serious violations of international human rights law and must immediately stop."", The experts noted that the military junta has unlawfully passed or is planning to pass a worrying series of regulatory measures that would entrench the control of the regime over the flow of information through the internet and strip individuals of their human rights., ""These vague and overly broad provisions would give the military unfettered power to censor dissenting voices on social media, disrupt the internet at will and access user information with no restraint or regard for their right to privacy,"" said the experts., Endorsing earlier calls from the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, the experts urged the military to restore democratic institutions, and ensure that all those detained for exercising their human rights are immediately released and not subjected to any harm while in custody., ""The progress of the last decade on democratisation, human rights and the existing dialogue processes initiated with minorities and indigenous peoples, albeit small, must not be lost,"" the experts said., ""We warn the military junta that those who are responsible for repression and killing of peaceful protesters as well as the detention of government officials and journalists will be held accountable before international jurisdictions""., The experts called on the international community to continue to push for the respect of the will of the people of Myanmar and for the peaceful return of the power to the civilian government. They further recall that business enterprises, including state-owned enterprises, have a responsibility to respect all internationally recognised human rights wherever they operate.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-military-must-restore-democracy-allow-people-protest-and-express-themselves

Water Sanitation Hygiene",24 Feb 2021,"Introduction, Myanmar faces multiple ongoing conflicts between the military and ethnic armed groups, marked by widespread violations of international humanitarian and human rights laws, causing substantial humanitarian needs. More than 336,000 people, displaced by conflict, currently live in camps in Kachin, Shan, Rakhine, Chin, and Kayin states, with limited access to basic services. International aid organisations struggle to assist those in need due to the access restrictions in several areas. Recurrent natural hazards also increase the vulnerability of residents in disaster-prone areas., What are the needs?, The United Nations estimates that more than 945,000 people in the country require humanitarian assistance, including those displaced in the conflict-torn states of Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan. Violence in northern Rakhine, which started on 25 August 2017, has forced more than 740,000 Rohingya to flee across the border into Bangladesh. Approximately 600,000 stateless Rohingyas remain in Rakhine state, 126,000 of whom have been confined to camps and deprived of basic rights, including freedom of movement and access to livelihoods since 2012., Restricted access to large parts of Rakhine state poses a significant challenge and has severely hampered the delivery of much-needed humanitarian aid in the area., Furthermore, the fighting between Myanmar Army and Arakan Army, an armed group in Rakhine, has resulted in the displacement of more than 100,000 non-Rohingya populations in Rakhine and Chin states since December 2018., In Kachin, Kayin and Shan states, prolonged armed conflicts have also taken a heavy toll on the local population. To date, more than 106,000 people are still displaced following clashes between armed groups and security forces. Limited humanitarian access severely restricts humanitarian operations particularly in areas beyond government control.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/echo-factsheet-myanmarburma-last-updated-24022021

Protection and Human Rights",23 Feb 2021,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in K'Ser Doh Township, Mergui-Tavoy District from August to October 2020, including problems in access to civil documents, activities surrounding the 2020 general election, as well as an update on the COVID-19[1] situation. With COVID-19 spreading to Mergui-Tavoy District, increased restrictions have added to the livelihood challenges of local villagers. School closures are impacting families and raising concerns about delinquency and drug use among children, as well as online dating and underage online “marriages”., Introduction, This situation update describes the situation of rural communities in Mergui-Tavoy District from August to October 2020. The main topics included in this situation update are: access to civil documents, political campaigning for the 2020 general election, COVID-19 restrictions and their impact on livelihood and education, including the impact of school closures., Civil documents, In Mergui-Tavoy District, some civilians have had to pay to become a citizen [to get their civil documents] whereas some people are not able to get citizenship at all [are not able to get civil documents]. This happened in Paw Hkloh area, K’Ser Doh Township, Mergui-Tavoy District. In order to become a citizen [get their national ID card], local people in this area had to first obtain their household [registration] documents which cost them 50,000 kyats [USD 35.58].[3] All the local people from several villages in Paw Hkloh area who did not have a household registration had to apply for it and pay the fee. [Whereas these documents are normally issued free of charge, the requirement of a payment prevented some villagers from obtaining them.], COVID-19 situation and local people’s experience, In August 2020, the second wave of COVID-19 started, making gatherings and movement more difficult. During the first wave of COVID-19, there were no reported cases of the virus in Mergui-Tavoy District, so there were not many problems [restrictions]. The only restriction was on holding public gatherings beyond 30 people and worshipping together. However, in this second wave of COVID-19, people in rural areas have become infected. Local people are now facing restrictions on their movement. In October, positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in every township in Mergui-Tavoy District except Tanintharyi Township., The Myanmar government provided [financial] support to the poor, [including those] who rely on casual day labour. Some villages did not receive any support. Because of the poor monitoring and assessment of [the situation] by the village tract administrator, Wa Hkaw Doh village, Kleh Mu Htee area, K’Ser Doh Township, Mergui-Tavoy District never received aid from the government. Wa Hkaw Doh villagers know that the Myanmar government provided aid [to other communities] four times already., During the COVID-19 outbreak, the increasing price of food has been a challenge [presented problems for villagers]. In the past, one sack of rice cost 22,000 kyats [USD 15.66] but since the outbreak, the price has gone up, ranging from 25,000 to 30,000 kyats [USD 17.79 to 21.35] per sack. At the same time, the price of crops produced by local farmers has decreased and much of their crops did not even get sold. As a result, local people are facing challenges in providing food for their families and managing other expenses., Education situation, Due to COVID-19, [many schools have closed and] children are complaining about not having classes: ""We are so bored and we are getting older wtih no worth [not able to improve our skills and knowledge through education]. We cannot study and our time is wasted [with nothing to do]."" Some local villagers have added that ""When they [children/adolescents] are not able to learn, we have seen that they follow their own desires and start chewing betel nut, smoking, drinking beer, and some even use drugs."" In addition, some local parents recounted: ""Since there is no school, teenagers have started using phones and date each other through Facebook. Some even got married [un-officially]."" ""We do not know how to deal with this anymore. It becomes difficult and challenging for parents when underage children are married [or at least claim to be married]."" Parents also feel depressed about this., 2020 general election update, The increase in the number of political parties in the 2020 election led to confusion for civilians. Many have remarked: “We do not know who to vote for anymore because there are a lot of parties.” In addition, Karen people are saying that every party has Karen candidates who do campaigning and who say that they will be working for Karen people. ""We do not know which party to vote for so this leaves us confused."" A villager in Noh Hpa Doh, Kleh Muh Htee area, K’Ser Doh Township, Mergui-Tavoy District said: “It would be great if all Karen people are in the same party. Now that the Karen party [Karen National Democratic Party] was formed, Karen people are also joining other parties as candidates, so I see that the votes of Karen civilians will go to several parties, which will prevent the Karen party from winning anymore [in the future]."", Due to COVID-19, the Ministry of Health and Sports declared a ban on public gatherings [which was not adhered to by the campaigning political parties]. In local communities, villagers remarked: “We cannot worship together or gather in groups. But we see that [political] parties are campaigning in groups and village leaders are calling almost every villager to come and listen to the campaign speech.” Villagers see that the activities of the government are not aligned with the policy of the Ministry of Health and Sports. Local people are saying: “We do not understand the situation anymore. The disease [COVID-19] is not decreasing but actually increasing throughout the country. […] We did not want to go when the parties came to do campaigning but we were afraid that people would see us as careless [irresponsible], so we had to go. We worry about getting the disease [COVID-19] as well because the party representatives are not people in our community.”, Conclusion, Since COVID-19 infections have been increasing in local areas, information was received through phone communication only. We [field researchers] cannot meet local people in person. This situation update was prepared during the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/mergui-tavoy-district-situation-update-access-civil-documents-covid-19-education-and

Call to save lives of Rohingya refugees reportedly adrift on a vessel in the Andaman Sea,News and Press Release,Save the Children,Protection and Human Rights,22 Feb 2021,"22 February 2021 - Responding to reports that a boat is in distress and drifting in the Andaman Sea with an unconfirmed number of Rohingya refugees aboard, Save the Children's Asia Regional Director Hassan Noor said:, “We're calling for an immediate search and rescue effort to help save the lives of those who reportedly are on board the drifting vessel. The conditions on the vessel are bound to be dire, as we’ve heard from children who embarked on similar journeys last year, and we should all be concerned that those aboard will need food and water., “This rescue effort must involve all relevant countries and authorities in the region. Governments can under no circumstances push any boats carrying refugees back out to sea. Instead they must allow them to dock and then provide humanitarian assistance to the people in need. Failure to do so violates international law and would also be cruel and inhuman, putting dozens of lives at risk., “As far as we are aware, this is the first reported boat carrying Rohingya refugees seen this year. We’re faced with the grim prospect that unsafe maritime movements will pick up pace over the coming months since the monsoon has ended, and that usually heralds the start of the perilous ‘sailing season’., “The people in distress on the reported vessel in the Andaman Sea must be a wakeup call to all governments in Asia, including ASEAN countries and members of the Bali Process, to work together to prevent deaths at sea. This should include coordinated search-and-rescue operations and responsibility sharing among countries to care for refugees., “In 2020, UNHCR estimated that hundreds of people were stranded on board rickety boats in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea, almost one-third of whom were children. Some 200 people lost their lives, the majority were Rohingya refugees., In the name of humanity, we must prevent a similar tragedy from repeating itself this year.”, ENDS, Emily Wight l Global Media Manager | Save the Children, Email: Emily.wight@savethechildren.org | Phone: + 44 (0) 7957 425 407, Skype: Emily-wight, www.savethechildren.net",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/call-save-lives-rohingya-refugees-reportedly-adrift-vessel-andaman-sea
Concerns about unfolding situation in Myanmar,News and Press Release,Lutheran World Federation,Protection and Human Rights,22 Feb 2021,"LWF stands with the churches and people of Myanmar (LWI) – The Lutheran World Federation (LWF) has expressed concerns about the ongoing crisis in Myanmar, which has continued to worsen since the beginning of this month..., “We are deeply concerned that the instability brought about by the ongoing political crisis in the country will further threaten the lives, livelihoods and dignity of people, especially those that were already grappling with challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Rev.

Secretary-General condemns lethal use of force against protestors in Myanmar,News and Press Release,UN News,Protection and Human Rights,21 Feb 2021,"At least two people were killed on Saturday in protests in Mandalay, the nation's second largest city, on Saturday, according to media reports., “I condemn the use of deadly violence in Myanmar,” the UN chief said on Sunday in a post on his official Twitter account., “The use of lethal force, intimidation & harassment against peaceful demonstrators is unacceptable. Everyone has a right to peaceful assembly. I call on all parties to respect election results and return to civilian rule.”, Mass protests have grown steadily across Myanmar since the military takeover on 1 February, following escalating tensions surrounding elections held in November, which were won by the National League for Democracy (NLD). Top party members were arrested, including leader Aung San Suu Kyi., Crowds gathered in Myanmar's capital, Nay Pyi Taw, on Sunday for the funeral of a young woman confirmed as the first person to be killed in the protests. Mya Thwet Thwet Khine, 19, died on Friday, after being shot in the head at a demonstration on 9 February., Tom Andrews, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, lamented her death in a post on Twitter on Friday., “Sadness & anger is how I reacted to news that Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing died of wounds inflicted by police in a callous & cowardly act as she protested the coup in Myanmar. I, and many others, mourn the loss of a courageous young woman & extend heartfelt condolences to her family,” he wrote., On Saturday, two people were killed in Mandalay when security forces opened fire on striking shipyard workers.

This madness must end, now!” he said in a tweet on Saturday., Earlier that day he posted: “The 33rd Light Infantry Division was reportedly involved in the lethal attacks in Mandalay today - the same division responsible for mass atrocity crimes against the Rohingya in 2017.

Protection and Human Rights",19 Feb 2021,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Daw Hpa Hkoh and Htaw Ta Htoo (Htantabin) townships, Taw Oo (Toungoo) District from January to July 2020. It includes information about livelihood, education and healthcare during COVID-19, as well as human rights violations regarding development and military activities., Education, There are both Karen Education and Culture Department [KECD] schools and Myanmar government schools in Daw Hpa Hkoh (Thandaunggyi) Township, Taw Oo (Toungoo) District. The schools experienced delays in opening for the academic year 2020-2021 due to COVID-19., [As of the writing of this update] the Myanmar government high schools are planning to open on July 13th 2020 and student registration has started already. There are [new] policies for the high school students and their parents to follow, as well as [school-wide] hygiene procedures to protect the students., The policies require students to wear masks and stay three feet [0.91 metres] away from each other. The parents or the guardian must arrange transportation for their children. People who bring and pick up their children must not be over 60 years old. The person who brings the children must be the same person who picks them up, and must wear a mask [when doing so]. This created issues for parents who have financial and livelihood problems, because some are unable to buy masks on a daily basis in order to bring and pick up their children from school., [Other substantive changes have also been made.] ""The Myanmar government schools have changed their curriculum [primary students will only be taught reading, not writing, and will have group exams instead of individual exams] which is a problem for students who are attending school in the academic year 2020-2021. [Additionally, if] the students fail to follow the [new COVID-19] policies and procedures, they will be punished or they will be fined"" recounted one of the students' parents., One of the students said that, ""There are more chances that students will have to drop out or quit school when they fail to follow the procedures for preventing the virus."" [Moreover, if] the students have to stay three feet away from each other, there will be not enough space in the classroom. There will be not enough buildings [classrooms] or school supplies., The parents are afraid and have concerns about their children going to school because of the COVID-19 situation. The reason is that the teachers who are assigned to Daw Hpa Hkoh High School and Htaw Ta Htoo (Htantabin) High School are from other areas such as Mon State and from towns where the Covid-19 infection rate is high. The parents do not know how the relevant government administrators and the township educational administrator are going to arrange for prevention. Therefore, the parents worry about COVID-19 infection. There are still weaknesses [in the prevention policies] of the Myanmar government schools, even though they are going to open. There is not enough [disinfectant] spraying at the schools and in the classrooms, and there are not enough prevention supplies for the health safety of the students., There are two townships in Taw Oo District: Htaw Ta Htoo and Daw Hpa Hkoh. And there is one KECD middle school and one KECD primary school in Daw Hpa Hkoh Township. The schools are self-funded schools, established by the local villagers [but they receive support from the KECD]. The teachers who are teaching at the schools have graduated from KECD schools in Taw Oo District. The students who finish grade four continue their education at the Hsa Thoo Lay Middle School in Daw Hpa Hkoh Township., The students who graduate from KECD schools such as Hsa Thoo Lay Middle School in Daw Hpa Hkoh Township continue their education at Htoh Lwee Wah High School [a KECD school which actually covers grades 5 to 12] and at Kaw Thoo Lei Junior College [a KECD post-secondary school] in Htaw Ta Htoo Township, Taw Oo District. Most of the students who go to study at the middle school in Daw Hpa Hkoh Township are from KNU-controlled areas and their parents have livelihood difficulties. The students who attend the Hsa Thoo Lay Middle School have fewer expenses [than schools in towns like Toungoo] because their parents bring rations [food] for them., Similarly, the students who graduate from [other] middle schools in Htaw Ta Htoo and Daw Hpa Hkoh Townships continue their studies at Htoh Lwee Wah High School and Htoh Lwee Wah Junior College in Htaw Ta Htoo Township. The annual school and dormitory fees total 300,000 kyats [USD 213] per student who attend the high school or college [which occupy the same campus]. However, if there are two or more students from one family who go there, they will only have to pay the fees for one student. Therefore, these two schools are more affordable [than other schools in the area], which means fewer numbers of students are unable to go to school [continue their secondary and post-secondary education]., There are at least 300 students studying at Htoh Lwee Wah High School and the junior college. The school committee and the dormitory committee still plan to open the school and accept dormitory students by finding donors to support the school and the dormitory.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/taw-oo-district-situation-update-education-healthcare-development-livelihood-and

"Myanmar Military Must End Excessive Use of Force against Protestors, Detention of Health Care Workers",News and Press Release,Physicians for Human Rights,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",18 Feb 2021,"In the midst of a violent military coup threatening democracy and the rule of law, the Myanmar military is reported to be engaging in excessive use of force against protestors and attacking health care workers, exacerbating a fragile human rights situation. In response, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) issued the following statement:, ""We are appalled and dismayed by reports that protestors in Myanmar, including doctors and other frontline health care workers, are being arrested and detained by the Myanmar military for exercising their rights to gather and peacefully protest government abuse and injustice. Equally concerning are reports that security forces are using excessive force and crowd-control weapons to harm anti-coup protestors. All protestors -- including doctors and other health care professionals -- have human rights and may not be lawfully arrested or detained without adequate due process, or threatened by excessive use of force at the hands of the military., ""Security forces have a responsibility to protect; they violate human rights when they resort to excessive force and abuse of crowd-control weapons. Recent reports of the Myanmar military's use of rubber bullets, water cannons, and live ammunition against civilian protestors -- including reports of the horrific attack on Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing, who was shot in the head during anti-coup protests and remains hospitalized in critical condition -- are direct violations of international law. Pursuant to applicable international human rights law, security forces must act with restraint and any use of force must be minimized, targeted, proportional, and directed at de-escalating violence., ""PHR fervently condemns any and all attacks against health care workers, including the unlawful detention of doctors and other medical personnel. Deliberately impeding health care workers in carrying out their duty and right to treat those in need -- regardless of politics, race, or religion -- is a breach of international law., ""During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical professionals in Myanmar have risked their lives to fight the virus. The coup has not only spurred civil disobedience protests by health care workers, thwarting health care delivery, but has also jeopardized Myanmar's public health response to the pandemic, as well as hopes of receiving COVID-19 vaccine assistance from other governments. As large demonstrations continue, the threat of COVID-19 only grows stronger -- compounding a public health crisis with the mounting human rights crisis in Myanmar., ""The coup d'état and crackdown by the Myanmar military -- also known as the Tatmadaw -- is abhorrent, but unfortunately not surprising. The Tatmadaw has a long history of human rights abuses against the people of Myanmar, including its campaign of crimes and human rights atrocities against the Rohingya, which Physicians for Human Rights has documented and corroborated., ""Physicians for Human Rights demands that the Tatmadaw immediately cease any further arrests of doctors, medical workers, human rights advocates, and any other individuals for whom there is no evidence of criminal acts, and release all who are being detained without cause. PHR also calls on the Tatmadaw to immediately cease the use of excessive force and crowd-control weapons against civilian protestors and demands that all responsible actors be held accountable for reported injuries sustained by demonstrators. We will continue to push for justice and accountability for all human rights abuses committed by Myanmar security forces."", In an earlier statement responding to the Myanmar military's coup d'état, PHR condemned mass arbitrary arrests and detention of civilian leaders and human rights defenders in Myanmar, as well as the apparent communications blackout in the country. The organization called for the immediate de-escalation of the situation, the prompt release of political prisoners, and the restoration of communications networks., PHR reprises its call to the international community to hold the Myanmar military and other responsible actors accountable for the campaign of widespread and systematic violence against the Rohingya ethnic minority in the August 2017 ""clearance operations"" that forced more than 720,000 Rohingya into neighboring Bangladesh. The Tatmadaw has an egregious history of human rights violations against civilians, including perpetrating forced labor, sexual violence, torture, extrajudicial killings, child labor, and other abuses in Chin state, which PHR documented in 2011. These efforts are more critically important as the perpetrators of these grave violations increase their political power within Myanmar., Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) is a New York-based advocacy organization that uses science and medicine to prevent mass atrocities and severe human rights violations.

"Atrocity Alert No. 240: Myanmar (Burma), Democratic Republic of the Congo and Cameroon",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,17 Feb 2021,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., MYANMAR’S MILITARY USES LETHAL FORCE AGAINST PROTESTERS, The threat of atrocities continues to increase in Myanmar following the 1 February military coup. On 9 February a 19-year-old protester, Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing, was fatally wounded when she was shot in the head by security forces in Naypyidaw. Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people continue to participate in daily strikes and protests against the state of emergency declared by the military, with the security forces using tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets and live ammunition in their attempts to suppress demonstrations. Overnight raids on the homes of activists, as well as beatings and arrests, have been widely reported and armored vehicles are now deployed in all major cities., According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, 495 pro-democracy politicians, political activists or protesters have been detained since 1 February. The vast majority of detainees are being held without charge., On 10 February the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, warned that all “officers, regardless of rank, can be held criminally liable for international crimes, including crimes against humanity involving killing, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture.” The UN Human Rights Council (HRC) held a Special Session on 12 February on the Myanmar crisis and adopted a resolution urging the security forces “to exercise utmost restraint” towards peaceful protests. On 16 February Special Rapporteur Andrews sounded alarm as protests continued, stressing, “I am terrified that given the confluence of these two developments­ – planned mass protests and troops converging – we could be on the precipice of the military committing even greater crimes against the people of Myanmar.”, In 2018 the HRC-mandated Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar concluded that senior members of the military, including the leader of the 1 February coup – General Min Aung Hlaing – should be prosecuted for genocide committed against the Rohingya, as well as for crimes against humanity and war crimes perpetrated in Kachin, Rakhine and Shan states. “With the same military officers now in charge of the country, the potential threat of atrocities being perpetrated against the civilian population is extremely high,” said Nadira Kourt, Program Manager at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect., The UN Security Council should urgently impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Myanmar, as well as targeted sanctions on General Min Aung Hlaing and the other coup leaders. All UN member states and foreign companies should immediately divest from all businesses linked to Myanmar’s military rulers, including the military-controlled conglomerates Myanmar Economic Holdings and Myanmar Economic Corporation., CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY CONTINUE IN EASTERN DRC, On 14 February suspected members of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) armed group raided the village of Ndalya in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s (DRC) Ituri province, killing 13 civilians and burning down a local church. The following day suspected ADF fighters killed 10 villagers in Kalembo, Beni territory, in neighboring North Kivu province. According to the Kivu Security Tracker, this was the third major attack perpetrated by the ADF in Beni since the start of February, with nighttime attacks claiming the lives of 14 people in Mabule on 5 February and 10 people in Kabembeu on 8 February., According to a 2 February report by the UN Joint Human Rights Office in the DRC, at least 849 civilians were killed by the ADF in Ituri and North Kivu provinces during 2020 and a further 534 were kidnapped. Local security forces also perpetrated violations of International Human Rights Law (IHRL) and International Humanitarian Law (IHL) while battling the ADF. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights noted that, “given the widespread and systematic nature of the attack directed against the civilian population, some of the documented human rights abuses may amount to crimes against humanity.”, On 16 February the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) also raised alarm at “ongoing atrocities carried out by armed groups in eastern DRC, which have become part of a systematic pattern to disrupt civilians’ lives, instill fear and create havoc.” According to UNHCR, between December 2020 and January 2021 alone, armed groups committed at least seven incursions into five sites for displaced populations in North Kivu. Some armed groups, including the ADF, have also forcibly occupied schools and attacked health centers throughout North Kivu., The DRC government and MONUSCO (the UN peacekeeping mission) must ensure that protecting civilians remains their primary priority as they address the ongoing threat posed by the ADF and other armed groups. The DRC government must also hold all perpetrators of crimes against humanity and other violations of IHL and IHRL accountable, including those from within their own security forces., VIDEO REVEALS TORTURE BY CAMEROONIAN SECURITY FORCES, On Monday, 15 February, the Ministry of Defense in Cameroon announced it had detained eight soldiers following the emergence of a video showing security forces torturing a young male suspected of ties to an armed separatist group. The video, which was shared widely on social media last Sunday, shows soldiers in Ndu, in the English-speaking north-west region, beating the young man with a machete until he loses consciousness., This latest incident is part of a catalogue of abuses perpetrated by government forces as part of their military campaign against armed separatist groups. While the arrest of the eight soldiers is a positive step towards accountability, there has been widespread impunity for atrocities perpetrated in the Anglophone regions., Since 2016 conflict over cultural rights and marginalization in Cameroon’s Anglophone regions has resulted in at least 3,000 civilians being killed and more than 750,000 displaced. Clashes between government forces and armed separatist groups have resulted in atrocities against the civilian population, including extrajudicial killings, kidnappings and torture. It has also resulted in the widespread destruction of villages, schools and hospitals throughout the north-west and south-west regions. Both sides of the conflict have been accused of grave violations and abuses of human rights., Despite the magnitude of the crisis in Cameroon, the African Union (AU) and UN Security Council (UNSC) have largely ignored the armed conflict. Earlier this month Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State of the Vatican, visited Cameroon and announced the Catholic Church’s readiness to facilitate a dialogue between the government and Anglophone separatist groups., Juliette Paauwe, Senior Research Analyst at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “it is significant that a growing number of states are condemning the ongoing violence in Cameroon. But now is the time to move from words to action and to use trade agreements and military assistance programs as leverage to ensure that the human rights of all Cameroonians are equally protected.” The UNSC and AU should support attempts by the Vatican to mediate a comprehensive ceasefire in the Anglophone regions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-240-myanmar-burma-democratic-republic-congo-and-cameroon

Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights to the Special Session of the Human Rights Council on Myanmar: seizure of power by the military constitutes a profound setback for Myanmar,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,12 Feb 2021,"The Human Rights Council this morning opened its special session on “the human rights implications of the crisis in Myanmar”, hearing the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights say that the seizure of power by the Myanmar military constituted a profound setback for the country, after a decade of hard-won gains in its democratic transition., Nada Al-Nashif, Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, said Myanmar’s democratically elected political leadership, including Aung San Suu Kyi and President U Win Myint, had been detained on politically motivated charges. The Office was tracking more than 350 political and State officials, activists and civil society members, including journalists, monks and students, who had been taken into custody. To this Council, she recommended the strongest possible call for the military authorities to respect the election result, return power to civilian control, and immediately release all individuals arbitrarily detained. , Tom Andrews, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, speaking on behalf of his mandate as well as the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures, noted that it was not the first time that the leaders of the Myanmar military, otherwise known as the “Tatmadaw”, had demonstrated their cynical belief that they were above the law - their own laws and the laws of nations. Even if election irregularities did exist, there was no justification for declaring a state of emergency, arresting the civilian leadership, and attempting to destroy Myanmar’s fledgling democracy. “As the people of Myanmar demonstrate their remarkable courage and resolve, let us demonstrate our support of them and the principles and values that they are fighting for,” Mr. Andrews added., Myanmar, speaking as a concerned country, said that, in light of the post-election irregularities and the following complex situation in the country, Tatmadaw was compelled to take the State responsibilities in accordance with the State Constitution. The state of emergency was declared for one year, and the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the State were transferred by the Acting President to the Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces. The State Administration Council was formed on 2 February 2021 with 16 members, including 8 senior military officials and 8 civilians. The Council retained the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission to continue their duties and responsibilities. Myanmar was undergoing extremely complex challenges and a delicate transition, and therefore looked forward to receiving better understanding on the prevailing situation in the country, and constructive engagement and cooperation from the international community., In the ensuing debate, some speakers said the military should release immediately the President, the State Counsellor and all those detained arbitrarily, and provide assurances of their safety and wellbeing. Any allegations of irregularities related to the elections should be settled through proper legal channels. Deeply shocked by reports of the use of live bullets against protestors, speakers called on the military to guarantee the safety of all peaceful demonstrators. Other speakers said the special session was not conducive to dialogue and cooperation with the concerned country and pointed out that the transfer of power to the State Administration Council had not led to an overhaul of the human rights architecture in Myanmar. Yet again, a special session had been organized by some countries against a country of the Global South. Reiterating their long-held position on country-specific human rights issues, speakers said what happened in Myanmar was essentially Myanmar’s affair. , Speaking were representatives of Portugal on behalf of the European Union, Denmark, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Libya, Austria, India, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Russian Federation, Poland, Brazil, Namibia, Bangladesh, Mexico, Argentina, Venezuela, China, Japan, Nepal, Netherlands, Sudan, Marshall Islands Ukraine, Philippines, Eritrea, Pakistan, Canada, Sierra Leone, Ireland, Norway, Botswana, Malaysia, Lithuania, Ecuador, Estonia, Slovenia, Romania, Sweden, Greece, Israel, Belarus, Holy See, New Zealand, Belgium, United States, Singapore, Liechtenstein, Malta, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Luxembourg, Croatia, Finland, Turkey, Switzerland, United Nations Children's Fund, Australia, Viet Nam, Slovakia, Iceland, Tunisia, Jordan, Spain, South Africa, Maldives, Qatar, Brunei Darussalam and United Kingdom on behalf of a group of countries., The Council will resume its special session on Myanmar at 3 p.m. this afternoon and it is expected to take action on a draft resolution on the situation in Myanmar at the end of the day before closing the special session., Opening Statements, Ambassador NAZHAT KHAN of Fiji, President of the Human Rights Council, opened the special session of the Council on the human rights implications of the crisis in Myanmar. She said that all delegations had shown a sense of commitment to ensure that, despite the current circumstances that prevented in-person meetings, the Council would meet in a hybrid environment. While not ideal, the hybrid modalities proposed for this session were the only option at this stage, and would only apply to this session, as a five-person limit was currently imposed on public gatherings because of the COVID-19 pandemic. These modalities should not, therefore, serve as a precedent., NADA AL-NASHIF, Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the seizure of power by the Myanmar military earlier this month constituted a profound setback for the country, after a decade of hard-won gains in its democratic transition. Myanmar’s democratically elected political leadership, including Aung San Suu Kyi and President U Win Myint, had been detained on politically motivated charges. The Office was tracking more than 350 political and State officials, activists and civil society members, including journalists, monks and students, who had been taken into custody. Several faced criminal charges on dubious grounds. Most had received no form of due process and had not been permitted legal representation, family visitations or communication. Some remained missing, with no information as to their whereabouts or well-being., Ms. Al-Nashif said that she and the High Commissioner greatly admired the conviction of the demonstrators – many of them young people and women, from diverse ethnic backgrounds – who had peacefully marched and participated in other activities to oppose the coup and crackdown. It was they who represented Myanmar's future: a future of shared justice and equitably shared national wealth amid harmonious relationships between peoples and communities. The indiscriminate use of lethal or less-than-lethal weapons against peaceful protestors was unacceptable. More violence against Myanmar’s people would only compound the illegitimacy of the coup, and the culpability of its leaders. This crisis was born of impunity. Long-standing lack of civilian control over the military, its disproportionate influence in the country’s political and economic structures, and its ongoing failure to genuinely account for crimes committed by the security forces over decades, had combined to compromise Myanmar’s democratization and its development. The democratic crisis that the people of Myanmar faced was deepened by economic disaster wreaked by the pandemic. , To the international community, Ms. Al-Nashif expressed her concern that any sanctions under consideration should be carefully targeted against specific individuals who were credibly alleged to have violated the people's rights. Leaders of this coup were an appropriate focus of such actions. To this Council, she recommended the strongest possible call for the military authorities to respect the election result, return power to civilian control, and immediately release all individuals arbitrarily detained. Additionally, the military authorities must not be allowed to exacerbate the situation of Rohingya people, after the extreme violence and decades of discrimination they had endured. Myanmar must fully comply with the provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice, and move to genuinely address the root causes of conflicts in Rakhine state and other ethnic minority areas. , She regretted that her Office had long been denied a presence in Myanmar, and urged the military authorities to grant it and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar full and immediate access.  To the people of Myanmar, she expressed support for their rights to justice, to freedom, to democratic participation, to personal safety and security, and to peaceful, sustainable and inclusive development. , TOM ANDREWS, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, speaking on behalf of his mandate as well as the Coordination Committee of Special Procedures, noted that it was not the first time that the leaders of the Myanmar military, otherwise known as the “Tatmadaw,” had demonstrated their cynical belief that they were above the law - their own laws and the laws of nations. Even if election irregularities did exist, there was no justification for declaring a state of emergency, arresting the civilian leadership, and attempting to destroy Myanmar’s fledgling democracy. The military junta had even failed to follow its own requirements for taking control of the country as specified in the constitution that the military itself drafted. This coup was truly illegal in every sense of the word. The international community must refuse to recognize this illegal regime.  , It was clear from his observations, consultations and discussions that opposition to the military coup was strong and it ran across the diversity of the Myanmar people. Despite the history of brutal crackdowns and with automatic weapons now trained on them, citizen protests were springing up in literally hundreds and hundreds of Myanmar townships, large and small. The response of police and security forces to the peaceful protests of a people united had gone from restraint to intimidation to bloodshed. There were growing reports and photographic evidence that Myanmar security forces had used live ammunition–– lethal force––against protesters. This violated international law. Arbitrary detentions and intimidation were also on the rise. Based on currently available information, since announcing the coup, the junta had detained at least 220 government officials and members of civil society. The Myanmar media was also coming under increasing threat from the junta. , The United Nations Security Council should be encouraged to consider all of the options it had previously used to deal with gross human rights violations. Barring concrete steps from the Security Council, the General Assembly could convene an Emergency Special Session. Member States themselves, of course, had the ability to act and were beginning to do so. He expected and urged other Member States to impose targeted sanctions and bilateral arms embargos, and ensure that the assistance that they provided to the people of Myanmar went to civil society organizations directly, whenever possible, instead of through the junta. This Council should encourage these steps. The private industry meanwhile had a responsibility to respect all internationally recognized human rights wherever they operated, in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. “As the people of Myanmar demonstrate their remarkable courage and resolve, let us demonstrate our support of them and the principles and values that they are fighting for,” Mr. Andrews concluded., Statement by Concerned Country, Myanmar, speaking as a concerned country, said that, in light of the post-election irregularities and the following complex situation in the country, Tatmadaw was compelled to take the State responsibilities in accordance with the State Constitution. The state of emergency was declared for one year, and the legislative, executive and judicial powers of the State were transferred by the Acting President to the Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces. The State Administration Council was formed on 2 February 2021 with 16 members, including 8 senior military officials and 8 civilians.  The Council retained the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission to continue their duties and responsibilities.  , On humanitarian matters, Myanmar would extend its continued cooperation with the United Nations, the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the World Food Programme, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other development partners. Myanmar would continue to implement the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population, and the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Rakhine state. Myanmar would steadfastly perform its duties as a State party to the international treaties, including the core human rights instruments and the International Labour Organization Conventions. As a member of ASEAN, Myanmar would continue to uphold the purposes and principles enshrined in the ASEAN Charter and the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia.  , On COVID-19, Myanmar would continue to exert utmost efforts to overcome the health and socio-economic challenges, and mitigate negative effects on the livelihood of the people. Myanmar was undergoing extremely complex challenges and a delicate transition, and therefore looked forward to receiving better understanding on the prevailing situation in the country, and constructive engagement and cooperation from the international community., General Debate, Condemning the coup in the strongest terms, speakers said the military should release immediately the President, the State Counsellor and all those detained arbitrarily, and provide assurances of their safety and wellbeing. Any allegations of irregularities related to the elections should be settled through the proper legal channels. Deeply shocked by reports of the use of live bullets against protestors, speakers called on the military to guarantee the safety of all peaceful demonstrators.  The right to access to information, as well as the freedoms of opinion and assembly, both online and offline, must be respected. , Other speakers said the special session was not conducive to dialogue and cooperation with the concerned country and pointed out that the transfer of power to the State Administration Council had not led to an overhaul of the human rights architecture in the country.  Yet again, a special session had been organized by some countries against a country of the Global South.  Reiterating their long-held position on country-specific human rights issues, speakers said what happened in Myanmar was essentially Myanmar’s affair. , Some speakers urged the reconvening of parliament, and others announced they would cease all development cooperation with the now illegitimate government.  In the current circumstances, it was crucial that the Special Rapporteur be allowed to continue his work, and it was particularly important to consider the rights of internally displaced individuals and refugees. It was necessary to establish a clear pathway to citizenship for the Rohingyas from Rakhine state, and ensure the voluntary and safe return of Rohingya refugees.  Council Members should put in place targeted action against the military, some said.  The military must uphold the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which it was a party., ___________, For use of the information media; not an official record",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/deputy-high-commissioner-human-rights-special-session-human-rights-council-myanmar
MSF concerned for welfare of healthcare workers and people in Myanmar,News and Press Release,MSF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",17 Feb 2021,"Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is gravely concerned about the recent unlawful arrests and detainment of healthcare workers, and people from the wider general public, following the military coup in Myanmar on 1 February 2021., The arrests, and the widespread restrictions following the recently imposed ‘state of emergency’, have the potential to severely interrupt the lifesaving healthcare that MSF, and others, have been providing to some of the most vulnerable people in Myanmar. This puts the safety of the wider public at risk, with mass detainments likely leading to further outbreaks of COVID-19. Alongside the arrests, the reports of violence against protestors, and the potential escalation of this violence, are greatly concerning., We are also deeply concerned about the harassment and intimidation faced by members of the medical community in Myanmar, and also the intimidation and arrests of people in the wider community. We see this crisis brings real fears, expressed by so many of our colleagues, and worry for the immediate and long-term effect on public health and general safety., In all circumstances, and regardless of age, religion or political affiliation, our patients come first, as does the safety of our staff and the partners we work with. We will continue to deliver impartial medical care to the most vulnerable people to the best of our capacity and while access and circumstances still allow for the provision of care., Currently, our programmes are running but staff movements have been restricted.

Myanmar: UN expert sounds alarm ahead of expected protests,News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",16 Feb 2021,"GENEVA (16 February 2021) – The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, today releases the following statement:, ""I fear that Wednesday has the potential for violence on a greater scale in Myanmar than we have seen since the illegal takeover of the government on February 1., A protest rally has been called for downtown Yangon today, and there may be protests in other cities and townships as well, following word that a secretive trial of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint began yesterday. At the same time, I have received reports of soldiers being transported into at least Yangon from outlying regions. In the past, such troop movements preceded killings, disappearances, and detentions on a mass scale., I am terrified that given the confluence of these two developments­ - planned mass protests and troops converging - we could be on the precipice of the military committing even greater crimes against the people of Myanmar., Today I am issuing an urgent call on all governments, individuals and entities that may have influence on Myanmar military authorities to use that influence to convince the junta that rallies planned for Wednesday must be allowed to proceed without detentions or violence. Continued repression of the people of Myanmar's basic liberties and human rights must end immediately., I call on the international business community in particular to take immediate action. Urgently call your interlocutors in the State Administrative Council and stress to them that you will be forced to suspend or cease business in Myanmar if they continue down this violent path. Specifically stress to them that under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, businesses and investors shouldsuspend or terminate activities with the Myanmar junta when the risk of involvement in serious human rights abuses can no longer be reasonably managed. I, and many others, would argue we have long passed that threshold. Please implore them to use restraint. Implore them to return power to the people of Myanmar., As I have made clear in prior statements, those in the chain of command, regardless of rank, can be held liable for any atrocities committed against the people of Myanmar, and they must disobey orders to attack., Of course, we cannot rely on the Myanmar military to avoid bloodshed out of a moral or legal obligation alone. That is why it is so imperative that all those with influence demand that the junta restrain itself from further violence and arbitrary arrests., If, as I fear, we see continued mass violence against peaceful protesters, those businesses continuing to work with the military, regardless of their actions, must accept that they are complicit in the violence.

"Taw Oo District Incident Report: Rape case in Daw Hpa Hkoh Township, August 2020",News and Press Release,KHRG,Protection and Human Rights,15 Feb 2021,"Part 2 - Information Quality, Explain in detail how you collected this information., A KHRG researcher interviewed the survivor on September 5th 2020., Explain how the source verified this information., The source experienced this incident first hand., Part 3 – Complete Description of the Incident, Describe the Incident(s) in complete detail., On August 12th 2020, Naw L---, a 75-year old widow from T--- village, K--- village tract, Daw Hpa Hkoh Township was raped by a fellow villager who snuck into her house between 12 am and 1 am., The survivor recounted the incident to KHRG: “He climbed from the ground up through a hole in the floor. […] I was trying to look at his face, but he did not show his face [it was dark and she could not find her torch (flashlight)]. I could hear his voice. […] He grabbed my hands and shut my mouth with his hand. I almost died. […] I was shouting [for help], but he was shutting my mouth [with his hand]. It was about midnight, and everyone was fast asleep. So, even if I could have shouted out loud, the villagers might not have heard me.”, The next morning, Naw L--- came to suspect a young man who used to come to her house to drink tea and chew betel nut. As she explained: “After the incident, he stopped coming [to my house]. I knew it right away [that he was the perpetrator]. […] He would always call me ‘Hpee Hpee’ [grandma]. Since the incident, he does not dare to call me [grandma] anymore. I think it was that man because many people talked about the unlawful acts he committed, such as stealing.”, She first reported the case to a local church leader, and eventually took the matter to the village head, who promised to investigate the case [KHRG was not able to establish the exact dates]. He interrogated both the survivor and perpetrator during separate meetings and recorded their statements. Although the perpetrator denied raping Naw L---, she later recognised his voice after listening to the audio statement he gave to the village head. Local leaders then asked the village tract administrator whether they could report the case further [to higher authorities], to which he replied: “If you do report the case further, tell me [keep me informed].”, After hearing that the case was referred to the village tract leader, the perpetrator showed up in front the village head’s house armed with a machete [KHRG was not able to establish the exact date]. Neither the village head nor his family were home at the time. Local villagers then gathered around the perpetrator, until his father eventually arrived at the scene and brought him back to their house. After this incident, the village head took his wife and children to another village out of concern for their safety., In his [the village head’s] absence, the deputy village head held a meeting with local leaders to decide whether this case should be reported to the Myanmar Police Force or to P’Doh[6] Jackson Htun [a KNU official]. They decided to report it to the KNU authorities. P’Doh Jackson Htun arrived at the village on September 4th 2020 to investigate the case. The KNPF eventually arrested the perpetrator on November 10th 2020., The survivor now hopes that justice will be served, and [even though the perpetrator was arrested, she] lives in constant fear of retaliation from the perpetrator: “During the incident, he told me he would come again. After the incident, I do not feel safe enough to sleep in my house alone anymore.” she did not benefit from counselling services to overcome her trauma., Before this incident, Naw L--- had already experienced sexual violence in the past. She was once raped by an escaped Tatmadaw[7] deserter while she was living in her late husband’s village [she does not remember the exact date, but she told KHRG that she lived there from 1986 to 1997]. This deserter was arrested by the head of the local militia and taken to the village, where he was violently slapped in the face until he bled. However, it is likely that justice has not been served regarding this case, as the survivor does not seem to know whether further action was taken against him., Update from a KHRG researcher, February 12th 2020: The KNPF released the perpetrator in December [KHRG was not able to establish the exact date] due to lack of evidence and witnesses. He is now back in the village, which leaves the survivor particularly vulnerable to retaliation and further abuses., Part 4 - Permission for Using the Details, Did the victim(s) provide permission to use this information?

"Dooplaya District Situation Update: COVID-19 restrictions and lack of rain threaten local livelihoods in Noh T'Kaw, Kruh Tu, Kaw T’Ree and Waw Ray townships, September to December 2020",Situation Report,KHRG,Protection and Human Rights,28 Jan 2021,"This Situation Update covers the impact of the COVID-19[1] pandemic in Noh T'Kaw, Kruh Tu, Kaw T'Ree and Waw Ray townships, Dooplaya District between September and December 2020. Travel restrictions to curb the spread of the virus have translated into livelihood difficulties for local villagers. Day labourers are now unable to travel around to find jobs, and some have started facing food shortages. In Kaw T'Ree Township, the lack of rain has damaged paddy fields in Hsoh K'Lee village tract.[2] The villagers affected are afraid they might face food shortages in the coming years if they cannot harvest enough rice.[3], Travel restrictions and prevention measures, Travel restrictions [to curb the spread of COVID-19] are currently being implemented in every township in Dooplaya District [according to a KHRG researcher, these restrictions started being put in place at the end of August 2020]. Transportation and travel are now more restricted than they were over the past few months, as the COVID-19 situation in Myanmar is not improving. There are screening checkpoints in some villages. These checkpoints also provide water, soap and masks. Some villages have banned the entry of outsiders. If important issues arise, villagers have to obtain a travel letter [issued by village heads or village tract administrators] to be able to enter other villages in their area., In Kruh Tu Township, local villagers are not allowed to go to other villages [both within and outside the township]. The relevant local authorities are allowed to travel, but only to deal with urgent issues; and provided that they carry a travel letter with them. Failure to present such a letter will result in them being denied entry [or ordered to go back to their village by one of the screening checkpoints along the way]. All the villages placed security guards at their entrance [to implement these restrictions]. The Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA),[4] the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army (DKBA),[5] the Border Guard Force (BGF)[6] and healthcare workers work together to check the temperature of the people who travel on the main road [a concrete road that connects the main cities in the region]. People with a normal body temperature can continue their journey., In Noh T'Kaw Township, local people cannot go to other villages but some people still travel on the main road. The KNLA, DKBA and BGF operate screening checkpoints along the main road, notably in Kah Li Hkee and Yah Ther Tah villages. People must wear a mask to be allowed into Kya Inn village, Kyain Shwe Doe village tract. Failure to wear a mask in the village will result in a 5,000 kyats [USD 3.75][7] fine. One villager from Law Pa Hkee, Yaw K'Daw village tract told KHRG: ""It is so difficult to travel between villages and village tracts. We cannot go from one place to another. If we do, we have to carry a travel letter with us."", There are travel restrictions in Kaw T'Ree Township as well. People who wish to go to other villages must obtain a travel letter. The letter only allows its holder to travel to specific places within a limited period of time. However, it is not easy to obtain travel letters to go to Khoh Ther Pler [Payathonzu], Seikgyi and Kawkareik towns, as the [KNU] authorities do not want the local villagers to go there., The Htee Th'Bluh Hpoh Hkee [Kaw T'Ree Township] village secretary told KHRG that it was not easy to travel between village tracts because of the COVID-19 restrictions. In addition, traders and local villagers are only allowed to sell and buy goods beside the screening checkpoint at the entrance of the village., There is a newly-built quarantine site in Kyaw Hta village, Kyaw Hta village tract, Kaw T'Ree Township, but not many people are being isolated there. There is no screening checkpoint but the villagers have to wear masks everywhere. The local villagers can go to Kya Inn village, Kyaikdon and to other towns but, according to the Karen National Union (KNU)[8] policies, they have to obtain a travel letter to go to other places [such as Hpa-an and other major towns]., On November 1st 2020, the KNU set up a COVID-19 screening checkpoint in Kaw T'Naw village, Poh Yay village tract, Kaw T'Ree Township. Karen villagers from nearby villages can travel to and buy foods or other things in Kyaikdon Town. However, outsiders from areas or towns such as Hpa-an, Kaw T'Ree and other places are banned from entering the local villages. The local villagers who want to go there have to obtain a travel letter from their village head., There are similar restrictions in Waw Ray Township. However, they are implemented more strictly as this township is close to Mon State., COVID-19 update and quarantine requirements, There have been no positive cases in Kruh Tu Township so far, but measures are in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19. People coming from towns or cities are banned from entering the township. [People can also choose to go through the quarantine process in order to enter the area.] People coming from towns will be sent to a quarantine site for 15 days if they are caught violating this restriction. They will only be allowed to enter the township afterwards., In Noh T'Kaw Township, people found with high fever at the screening checkpoints are immediately sent to the closest hospital [by the health workers manning the checkpoints]. Local villagers coming back from other areas have to stay in a quarantine site for 14 or 15 days before being allowed into their village [this seems to apply to villagers who were outside of the township when the restrictions were established]. Almost all the bigger villages have their own quarantine site. In Yaw K'Daw village tract, the village authorities told the local villagers that they could not go to Khoh Ther Pler (Payathonzu) because they did not know whether the virus had spread there., In Kaw T'Ree Township, local villagers are not allowed to travel, unless they have a travel letter. People who travel to other locations without a travel letter need to spend 14 [or 15 days, depending on the village] in a quarantine site before being able to return home [this requirement does not apply to villagers who obtained a travel letter ahead of their travel, as they are usually required to come back to their village within one day]. These rules were established by local and village authorities. These authorities informed the villagers that such restrictions were meant to limit the spread of COVID-19. There have been no cases of COVID-19 in Waw Ray Township either, but prevention measures are being implemented nonetheless., In some places, there are no quarantine sites. In Kya Inn village, Noh T'Kaw, the nurses avoid touching patients who do not appear to be suffering from serious diseases [even though, according to a KHRG researcher, these nurses wear personal protective equipment]. They just question them [on their symptoms] and give them medicine. They [local authorities in Kya Inn] did not build a special place to isolate suspected cases of COVID-19. Potential COVID-19 patients are kept at the local school. Some other villages [in the district] are also doing the same. The village leaders said that they did not have enough funds to build a quarantine site, so they decided to use the local school instead., Livelihood difficulties, COVID-19 restrictions have translated into livelihood difficulties for the local villagers, as they cannot travel to look for jobs. Consequently, they do not have enough food left, such as rice [and they cannot afford to buy more]. The first and second waves of COVID-19 infections have been a threat to the livelihood of the local villagers in Kruh Tu and Noh T'Kaw townships. The Myanmar government and the organisations affiliated with the KNU established policies to curb the spread of COVID-19 [such as travel restrictions]. Therefore, the local villagers cannot travel. The local villagers worry that they will be left with nothing to eat because they cannot travel to find work and there is no other work for them. They are worried because they do not have enough food, and some even had to borrow [food or money to buy it] from others., In Kaw T'Ree Township, local villagers are facing livelihood difficulties because of the lack of rain. The villagers have been complaining about it since September 25th 2020. As the lack of rain damaged their paddies, they fear that they might face food shortages in the coming years. The entire Hsoh K'Lee village tract faces this problem. This issue was reported in the following villages: Kwee Tah Auh, Maw K'Noo Hkee, Hsoh K'Lee, Paw Baw Hta, K'Neh Thay Poe Lay, Meh K'La Hkee, Hser Poe Hkee, Poh Kler Hkee and Kraw Plaw. This has been a big challenge for the villagers, and they are now waiting to see the situation. If their paddies cannot be harvested in November or December 2020, they will face huge problems in 2021. [Although the villagers did manage to harvest some rice, it will not be enough to cover their daily needs in 2021.], Conclusion, This situation update covered the situation in all four townships in Dooplaya District. The situation on the ground is getting worse when compared to previous months. Everyone has to abide by the COVID-19 restrictions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/dooplaya-district-situation-update-covid-19-restrictions-and-lack-rain-threaten-local
Myanmar Update – 15 February 2021,Analysis,Insecurity Insight,"Health
Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",15 Feb 2021,"Summary, The Myanmar coup will likely lead to escalating civil resistance and a consequent heavy-handed military response., The military will continue to expand control over the internet – leading to frequent “blackouts”., Monitoring the human rights situation as well as providing aid and development support will become increasingly difficult in the months ahead., Background to the November 2020 Elections, Myanmar experienced five years of relative political stability after the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) handed power to State Counsellor (a position roughly analogous to Prime Minister) Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) following the November 2015 elections – which ended almost 50 years of military rule. Even then, however, the Tatmadaw retained substantial power, including the right to appoint a quarter of parliamentarians and control of key ministries., Elections to both Myanmar’s upper house - Amyotha Hluttaw - and lower house - Pyithu Hluttaw - took place on 8 November 2020. Suu Kyi’s NLD won a popular landslide, taking 161 (of the 224) seats in the Amyotha Hluttaw and 315 (of the 440) in the Pyithu Hluttaw, an even larger margin than in 2015. This equated to 83% of the available seats, while the Tatmadaw’s proxy, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), won a total of just 33 seats. The USDP immediately began making accusations of fraud after the vote although the Union Election Commission said there was no proof to support these claims and there has been little or no independent evidence either., The Tatmadaw also disputed the results, claiming that the vote was fraudulent, perhaps fearing that the NLD, with its majority, would amend the constitution to reduce the Tatmadaw’s political influence – a longstanding NLD campaign pledge. However, the NLD would have been unlikely in practice to do so as it would have required the support of 75% of the parliament – i.e., all the non-military parliamentarians., There is also evidence that the Tatmadaw feared greater opening-up of the country and viewed the timing – with the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority either expelled or disenfranchised and the COVID-19 pandemic limiting global action on other issues – as opportune. Tatmadaw Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing may also have feared that his lack of a clear role as a political leader could have exposed him to potential prosecution and accountability for alleged war crimes during the Rohingya conflict.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-update-15-february-2021

The Council also called urgently for the immediate and unconditional release of all persons arbitrarily detained, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint and others, and the lifting of the state of emergency, and stressed the need to refrain from violence and fully respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law., The Council further requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar to assess the current human rights situation in Myanmar, and to provide updates in their reports to the Human Rights Council, and called upon Myanmar authorities to engage and cooperate with United Nations human rights mechanisms., The United Kingdom and Austria on behalf of the European Union introduced the draft resolution., Speaking in explanation of vote were China, Russian Federation, Venezuela, Bolivia and the Philippines., Myanmar spoke as a concerned country., Before the Council adopted the resolution, it continued its general debate, in which speakers said that censorship had been tightened in Myanmar and security forces had cracked down violently against peaceful protesters, in violation of international standards. Noting that the military had blocked access to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and a number of virtual private networks, speakers warned that further Internet cuts could allow the military to commit more human rights violations. Aung San Suu Kyi and other political leaders should be immediately released, as should all those who were arbitrarily detained, speakers stated., Speaking in the general debate were the following civil society organizations: International Federation for Human Rights Leagues, Article 19 - International Centre Against Censorship, Alliance Defending Freedom, International Commission of Jurists, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, CIVICUS - World Alliance for Citizen Participation, Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development, Caritas Internationalis (International Confederation of Catholic Charities), Christian Solidarity Worldwide, and Maat for Peace, Development and Human Rights., This was the twenty-ninth special session of the Council., The forty-sixth regular session of the Human Rights Council will take place from 22 February 2021 to 23 March 2021., Resolution on the Human Rights Implications of the Crisis in Myanmar, In a resolution A/HRC/S-29/L.1 on the human rights implications of the crisis in Myanmar, adopted without a vote as orally revised, the Council deplores the removal of the Government elected by the people of Myanmar in the general election held on 8 November 2020, and the suspension of mandates of members of all parliaments, and calls for the restoration of the elected Government. The Council also calls urgently for the immediate and unconditional release of all persons arbitrarily detained, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, and others, and the lifting of the state of emergency, and stresses the need to refrain from violence and fully respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. The Council strongly calls upon the Myanmar military and other security forces and authorities to take steps immediately to protect the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, religion or belief, association and peaceful assembly in accordance with international human rights law, and to ensure that members of civil society organizations and the media are able to operate freely and without fear of violence, harassment or intimidation. The Council also calls for the immediate lifting of restrictions on the Internet, telecommunication and social media, in accordance with international human rights law. The Council further requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar to assess the current human rights situation in Myanmar, and to provide updates in their reports to the Human Rights Council, and calls upon Myanmar authorities to engage and cooperate with UN human rights mechanisms, and further requests the Secretary-General to provide increased assistance and the resources and expertise necessary to enable them to discharge the mandate fully., General Debate, Speakers said censorship had been tightened in Myanmar and security forces had cracked down violently against peaceful protesters, in violation of international standards.  Noting that the military had blocked access to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and a number of virtual private networks, speakers warned that further Internet cuts could allow the military to commit more human rights violations.  Over 220 people have been arbitrarily detained and many more were now in hiding.  Members of the Council should support all accountability mechanisms and any solutions for the peaceful resolution of the current situation.  It should not be forgotten that there were reasons to believe that the military had committed crimes against humanity and possibly genocide.  States should implement targeted sanctions against military leaders responsible for the coup, as well as against their business interests.  The warning signs were ominous: Myanmar risked returning to the days of mass incarceration of human rights defenders.  Aung San Suu Kyi and other political leaders should be immediately released, as should all those who were arbitrarily detained, speakers stated.  The military must lift restrictions on humanitarian access.  Some speakers urged a global arms embargo on Myanmar.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/human-rights-council-calls-release-all-arbitrarily-detained-persons-myanmar-and

Protection and Human Rights",12 Feb 2021,"12 February 2021, Madam President, Excellencies, Dear colleagues,, The seizure of power by the Myanmar military earlier this month constitutes a profound setback for the country, after a decade of hard-won gains in its democratic transition., Those gains, which this Council reviewed less than three weeks ago in Myanmar’s third UPR, had been reinforced by the clear results of the general elections of November 2020 – now effectively betrayed by the coup and the declaration of a one-year State of Emergency., Myanmar’s democratically elected political leadership, including Aung San Suu Kyi and President U Win Myint, have been detained on politically motivated charges. Our Office is tracking more than 350 political and state officials, activists and civil society members, including journalists, monks and students, who have been taken into custody. Several face criminal charges on dubious grounds. Most have received no form of due process and have not been permitted legal representation, family visitations or communication. Some remain missing, with no information as to their whereabouts or well-being., The High Commissioner and I greatly admire the conviction of the demonstrators – many of them young people and women, from diverse ethnic backgrounds – who have peacefully marched and participated in other activities to oppose the coup and the crackdown. It is they who represent Myanmar's future: a future of shared justice and equitably shared national wealth, amid harmonious relationships between peoples and communities., The world is watching. Draconian orders have been issued this week to prevent peaceful assembly and free expression, and police and military presence on the streets has grown progressively over the last several days. Following violent clashes with police on 9 February, at least one woman is in critical condition. Pro-military and nationalist groups have also taken to the streets., Let us be clear: the indiscriminate use of lethal or less-than-lethal weapons against peaceful protestors is unacceptable. More violence against Myanmar’s people will only compound the illegitimacy of the coup, and the culpability of its leaders., Madam President,, This crisis was born of impunity. Long-standing lack of civilian control over the military, its disproportionate influence in the country’s political and economic structures, and ongoing failure to genuinely account for crimes committed by the security forces over decades, have combined to compromise Myanmar’s democratization and indeed, its development., For over twenty years, successive High Commissioners and many eminent experts have briefed this Council, and its predecessor, on violations committed by the country's military, which include some of the most serious crimes alleged under international law. Lack of action to address them has emboldened military leaders and contributed to this present crisis., As this Council’s own Fact Finding Mission warned explicitly in 2018, “The Tatmadaw is the greatest impediment to Myanmar’s development as a modern democratic nation. The Commander-in-Chief of the Tatmadaw, Min Aung Hlaing, and all the current leadership must be replaced, and a complete restructuring must be undertaken to place the Tatmadaw under full civilian control. Myanmar’s democratic transition depends on it.”, Today, the democratic crisis that the people of Myanmar face is deepened by economic disaster wreaked by the pandemic. Already, COVID-19 has had profound impact, severely taxing a fragile health system and marginal social safety nets, and driving millions of people into severe financial distress. The reckless actions of the military leadership raise the spectre of a reimposition of broad sanctions on the country – and could threaten many years of development gains., To the international community, I express my concern that any sanctions under consideration should be carefully targeted against specific individuals who are credibly alleged to have violated people's rights. Leaders of this coup are an appropriate focus of such actions. It is of critical importance that no harm should be inflicted on the most vulnerable people in the country; and that assistance to help fight the pandemic can continue, alongside humanitarian support in conflict areas., To this Council, we recommend the strongest possible call for the military authorities to respect the result of the election, to return power to civilian control and to immediately release all individuals arbitrarily detained. They should have prompt access to legal representation and medical support, and specious criminal charges should be dropped. Internet and telecommunications restrictions must be lifted to allow media freedoms and access to information through the Internet. The courageous human rights defenders, civil society and trade union movement that have emerged in recent years must be protected., Additionally, the military authorities must not be allowed to exacerbate the situation of the Rohingya people, after the extreme violence and decades of discrimination that they have endured. Myanmar must fully comply with the provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice, and move to genuinely address the root causes of conflicts in Rakhine State and other ethnic minority areas., We regret that our Office has long been denied a presence in Myanmar, and urge the military authorities to grant OHCHR and the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar full and immediate access., To the people of Myanmar, we express our support for your rights to justice, to freedom, to democratic participation, to personal safety and security, and to peaceful, sustainable and inclusive development. We have been greatly moved by your determination – and also by the solidarity expressed by many members of ethnic groups who themselves have faced discrimination and violence., The High Commissioner and I are hopeful that, from this crisis, you will be able to rebuild a country that rests on firmer democratic foundations, which can ensure the equality, dignity, human rights and the full inclusion of all in national development. And we are confident that the entire UN family – from its many teams on the ground to this Council and other bodies – will continue to stand together, with you, to uphold your legitimate aspirations for a free Myanmar., Thank you, Madam President",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/special-session-human-rights-implications-crisis-myanmar-statement-deputy-high

It is our absolute intention to continue this work also under the current circumstances,” said Ola Almgren, the UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Myanmar., “It is essential that lifesaving humanitarian assistance continues unimpeded and that humanitarian partners are given timely and safe access to the populations in need,” he said, stressing “as always, our humanitarian response is guided by the internationally recognized principles of neutrality, impartiality, independence and humanity”., Just last year, and thanks to the generous support of donors, 930,000 women, children and men in conflict-affected areas received food assistance, 250,000 people accessed essential healthcare services, and hundreds of thousands received nutrition support.

Communities also received basic relief items, such as essential shelter and household materials, and were able to access safe drinking water and sanitation facilities., “Efforts to reach people in need of lifesaving assistance must be scaled up. This year, the Myanmar Humanitarian Response Plan aims to respond to the needs of close to 1 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, for whom we are seeking US$276.5 million in funding,” added Almgren. An estimated 336,000 of them are internally displaced people, 250,000 of whom are in situations of protracted displacement, including around 130,000 people in Rakhine., The United Nations in Myanmar reiterates the Secretary-General’s words of unwavering support of the UN to the people of Myanmar in their pursuit of democracy, peace, human rights and the rule of law.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/united-nations-continues-lifesaving-humanitarian-assistance-myanmar

It was later confirmed that Ma Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing a 19-year old woman, who was shot in the head by security forces, was the first reported victim of this violence. Doctors have confirmed since that the young woman is currently in critical condition and being kept on life support. Ma Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing should have been celebrating her 20th birthday today. UN Women extends its deepest sympathy to her family and friends and calls upon the military and police to refrain from using disproportionate force against demonstrators., Over the past decade, the women and women civil society organizations of Myanmar have played an essential role in the transition process towards a prosperous and democratic society and have been central in advocating for peace and inclusive governance.

We echo the words of the United Nations Secretary-General reaffirming the unwavering support of the United Nations to the people of Myanmar in their pursuit of democracy, peace, human rights and the rule of law, and urging the military leadership to respect the will of the people of Myanmar and adhere to democratic norms, with any differences to be resolved through peaceful dialogue.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/un-women-calls-upon-all-stakeholders-listen-voices-women-myanmar-response-political
ACLED Regional Overview – Southeast Asia (30 January - 5 February 2021),Analysis,ACLED,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",11 Feb 2021,"By Fiona Wong, Last week in Southeast Asia, the democratically elected government of Myanmar was overthrown by the military. Following this, protests erupted across the country in opposition to the coup d’état. A civil disobedience movement launched by health workers and other civil servants who have gone on strike has also been quickly gaining momentum since the coup. Solidarity demonstrations against the coup in Myanmar were also held by Burmese and non-Burmese nationals alike in Thailand and Indonesia. Meanwhile, fighting between state forces and rebel groups was reported in Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In Thailand, violence perpetrated by Malay Muslim separatists in the deep south spiked ahead of previously-postponed peace talks between the insurgents and the Thai government. Meanwhile, Papuan separatists continued to clash with state forces in Indonesia. In the Philippines, fighting between communist rebels and state forces was more lethal last week. Relatedly, people protested both for and against the controversial Anti-Terrorism Act as legal challenges were brought against it last week. The law was passed last year on the grounds that it was needed to curb the communist insurgency., In Myanmar, the military staged a coup and declared a year-long state of emergency on 1 February, overthrowing the democratically elected National League for Democracy (NLD) government. Top officials of the NLD government, including President U Win Myint and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, were arrested by military personnel as power was handed over to army chief Min Aung Hlaing. They have since been held incommunicado as many more elected lawmakers, officials, and activists were arrested across the country (AAPP, 4 February 2021). The coup d’état comes on the heels of escalating allegations of electoral fraud by the military and the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), alongside an increase in protests claiming the same. Such allegations have been dismissed as unfounded by election observers (CNA, 1 February 2021). The military has promised to hold new elections after the state of emergency ends and to hand over power to the winner, but many are skeptical this will occur (Myanmar Times, 5 February 2021)., In the wake of the coup, demonstrations opposing the coup d’état and calling for Aung San Suu Kyi’s release have erupted across the country. In numerous cities, people made noise to express their demands by participating in pot-banging and car honking protests from their residences and on the streets. Meanwhile, health workers went on strike as they launched a civil disobedience movement that was quickly joined by teachers and civil servants, including staff from several ministries (Irrawaddy, 3 February 2021). More than 60 such demonstrations were recorded in Myanmar last week even as bans on social media were imposed alongside disruptions to the internet (BBC, 5 February 2021; CNN, 5 February 2021; AP, 7 February 2021). The movement is expected to grow as more people are taking to the streets. Solidarity demonstrations against the coup in Myanmar were also held in Indonesia and Thailand. While these protests largely proceeded peacefully, in Bangkok, a demonstration by Myanmar nationals joined by anti-government demonstrators from the Thai People’s Party movement in front of the Myanmar embassy turned violent as police attempted to disperse the gathering. Three Thai demonstrators were also arrested (Thai PBS World, 2 February 2021)., Meanwhile, separatist violence was reported in Thailand and Indonesia. In Thailand’s deep south, there was a spike in violence by Malay Muslim separatists. In Narathiwat province, five policemen were wounded by a roadside bomb planted by the rebels, while in Pattani province, a civilian was shot dead. Meanwhile, a series of arson attacks were carried out across several provinces. In particular, the rebels targeted security cameras and telecommunication towers (Matichon, 31 January 2021). Messages against Buddhists and soldiers were also found near the sites of the arson attacks in Narathiwat province (Bangkok Post, 31 January 2021). The spike in violence comes just ahead of online peace talks between the main insurgent group in the region, Barisan Revolusi Nasional Melayu Patani (BRN), and the Thai government on 3 February (Khaosod, 5 February 2021). The meeting, which was facilitated by Malaysia, marks a resumption of the peace dialogue between the two sides. It was the first such meeting to be held in almost a year after plans to meet last year were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic (Benar News, 3 February 2021)., In Indonesia, insurgents from the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) continue to fight with state forces in Papua province. Last week, a rebel was killed during a clash in Sugapa district, Intan Jaya regency. This comes after the rebels killed three soldiers last month. Additionally, it was reported that at the end of January, villagers in Sugapa district were forced to flee their homes following threats from military personnel to “shoot all people” in their village if it was not evacuated (HumanRightsPapua, 3 February 2021)., In the Philippines, there was an uptick in fighting between the communist New People’s Army (NPA) and state forces. The clashes were also deadlier than the week prior, with at least 12 fatalities – including nine NPA members – reported last week. This comes as the controversial 2020 Anti-Terrorism Act comes under scrutiny at the Supreme Court. On 2 February, the first session of oral arguments was held, where 37 petitions by civil society groups against the law were presented (The Diplomat, 4 February 2021). The Duterte administration has insisted that the passage of the law was necessary in order to curb the communist insurgency, which the president claims is the biggest security threat to the country (Philippine Daily Inquirer, 23 June 2020). However, critics of the law, including activists and human rights groups, condemn it as a tool to restrict dissent and free speech, as its definition of “terrorism” is overly broad, and it contains clauses that allow law enforcement to carry out warrantless arrests on grounds of suspicion. Concerns about red-tagging – the labelling of individuals and organizations as communist – becoming even more deadly in the Philippines have also sparked opposition to the law. As the legal challenges against the law were brought forward last week, people gathered outside the Supreme Court to protest both for and against it.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/acled-regional-overview-southeast-asia-30-january-5-february-2021

We are deeply concerned that recent events will undo decades of hard-won progress by the people of Myanmar in overcoming poverty and promoting human rights. We hold particular concern for marginalised minorities and vulnerable groups, such as people living in areas of the country where there was already violent conflict, and women and girls — as experience shows us they are often disproportionately affected in times of crisis. We call on all parties to ensure local and international humanitarian groups are afforded access to deliver vital, lifesaving aid wherever it is needed, especially in light of the global pandemic.”, We echo the United Nations’ Secretary General’s call for Myanmar’s military leadership to respect the will of the people and adhere to democratic norms, with any differences to be resolved through peaceful dialogue., CARE International condemns any use of force to overthrow an elected government, or to suppress protests. In particular, we are deeply concerned about the reported use of inappropriate levels of force against demonstrators around the country., CARE International urges all parties in Myanmar to refrain from violence and uphold people’s fundamental human rights, including freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and the right to information.

UNICEF calls for greater attention to protection of children’s rights in Myanmar during time of crisis,News and Press Release,UNICEF,Protection and Human Rights,9 Feb 2021,"YANGON, 9 February 2021 – UNICEF expresses deep concern regarding the impact of the ongoing crisis in Myanmar on children’s wellbeing and reminds all parties of their obligations to uphold all children’s rights as enshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), to which Myanmar is a State Party, and under the Myanmar Child Rights Law enacted in July 2019. These rights include the rights to protection, participation, peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. They also include freedom from unlawful or arbitrary detention or separation from parents. In crisis situations, children are often disproportionally affected, and it is essential that all parties uphold the best interests of the child, one of the core principles of the CRC, as a primary consideration., In the context of ongoing demonstrations and current events, and reports of injuries, some potentially fatal, UNICEF calls on all actors, including security forces, to exercise the utmost restraint, to resolve differences through constructive and peaceful means, and to prioritize the protection and safety of children and young people as they express their opinions., In times of crisis, children often experience greater stress and risks, and may require additional protection.

UN expert warns security forces in Myanmar: Following orders is no defence for atrocities,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,10 Feb 2021,"GENEVA (10 February 2021) – A UN human rights expert today expressed alarm at reports of the use of lethal force by security forces against protesters demonstrating against the military coup in Myanmar., Tom Andrews, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, said all members of the security forces, regardless of rank, had an obligation under international law not to use excessive force, and that they risked being prosecuted if they did so.
“Myanmar military personnel and police need to know that ‘following orders’ is no defence for committing atrocities and any such defence will fail, regardless of their place in the chain of command. International crimes are manifestly unlawful., “I am alarmed at the increasing levels of force against peaceful protesters,” he said. “People are frightened but also determined. It is imperative that security forces stand down before there are more casualties of protesters who are exercising their fundamental rights to freedom of expression and association.”, During the first week of the coup, hundreds of arbitrary detentions were registered, including members of the National League for Democracy, civil society members and protesters. The whereabouts of many remain unknown and some are being held in incommunicado detention. It is also believed that many activists and human rights defenders have gone into hiding., “Security forces, including commanders, soldiers and other security personnel have a moral, professional and legal obligation to protect the people of Myanmar, not provoke or assault them,” said Andrews., “As protesters take their message peacefully to the streets of Myanmar, I remind all security officials and officers that they must not use excessive force against peaceful protesters,” he said., “Officers, regardless of rank, can be held criminally liable for international crimes, including crimes against humanity involving killing, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture. This exposure to criminal liability extends through the entire chain of command, from the highest levels of the military to foot soldiers and police officers, and everyone in between.”, ENDS, Mr. Thomas Andrews (United States of America) is the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar. A former member of the US Congress from Maine, he has a Washington DC based consulting practice, Andrews Strategic Services. He has worked with the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs and parliamentarians, NGOs and political parties in Cambodia, Indonesia, Algeria, Croatia, Serbia, Ukraine and Yemen. He has been a consultant for the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma and the Euro-Burma Network, has run advocacy NGOs including Win Without War and United to End Genocide, and is a Robina Senior Human Rights Fellow at Yale Law School.
The Special Rapporteurs are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.

Myanmar Crisis,News and Press Release,Trócaire,Protection and Human Rights,10 Feb 2021,"Trócaire is shocked by the political crisis unfolding in Myanmar since 1st February., The people of Myanmar have experienced too many decades of violence and conflict. Too many women, men, girls and boys are deprived of their basic needs and are very uncertain about their future.

We are committed to the communities we serve and are concerned that recent events may set back progress in these vital areas., Trócaire is very concerned that current events could result in reduced humanitarian access and that those most in need will experience further suffering. Myanmar has made great strides in recent years to build a bright future for its people and there is now a risk that this will be lost., As the crisis continues to unfold, Trócaire calls on all parties to engage in dialogue and peaceful means to find a lasting solution., In the words of Cardinal Charles Maung Bo “Peace is possible.

Myanmar: Lethal Force Used Against Protesters,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,9 Feb 2021,"Draconian Measures Violate Right to Free Assembly, (New York) – Myanmar police should immediately end the use of excessive and lethal force against people protesting the February 1, 2021, military coup, Human Rights Watch said today. On February 9, police shot a young woman in the back of her head and wounded a man in his chest at a protest in the capital, Naypyidaw, a doctor reported., On February 8, military authorities imposed a curfew and overly broad restrictions on gatherings in 36 townships, effectively making all peaceful assemblies unlawful, in violation of international law. Despite the restrictions, on February 8 and 9, hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in largely peaceful protests across the country to call for the military to relinquish power and return it to the elected government. In response, the police used teargas, water cannons, rubber bullets, and live ammunition., “Myanmar police shooting at a woman demonstrator whose back was turned is unconscionable as well as unlawful,” said Richard Weir, crisis and conflict researcher. “The police need to stop responding to peaceful protests by firing off guns and immediately investigate alleged wrongful use of force. Myanmar’s military junta should rescind its draconian orders on protests and end its crackdown.”, Human Rights Watch spoke to a doctor and reviewed and verified four photographs and two videos posted on Facebook of a demonstration on the afternoon of February 9 in Naypyidaw. One 84-second video shows a group of demonstrators under a green awning approximately 12 meters from a police vehicle mounted with water cannons. Several demonstrators can be seen throwing debris toward the police and the police vehicle nearby. The police vehicle then fires a stream of water at the protesters under and near the awning., In the video, a woman later identified by medical staff as Mya Thwe Thwe Khine, 20, wearing a red t-shirt and helmet at the front of the line, is struck by the water cannon’s stream. Another woman holds her hand and helps to guide her away from the stream of water. As Mya Thwe Thwe Khine turns away from the water blast and the police line, a crack is heard, and she slumps to the ground. A line of police officers is seen positioned in the direction from which she was shot., Several other demonstrators tend to her and carry her away from the front of the area near the green awning. While she is being picked up and carried, water is sprayed at least three more times in the direction of the awning toward the people shielding behind it., Human Rights Watch observed no actions by Mya Thwe Thwe Khine in the video that would suggest she was engaged in or threatening violent acts or had anything in her hands. By matching visible landmarks, Human Rights Watch confirmed the location of this video to be on Taungnyo Road near the Thapyaygone roundabout, matching the same location as the other video and photographs reviewed from the demonstration., A doctor speaking for the hospital in Naypyidaw where the woman was being treated said that she had a projectile lodged in her head and had lost significant brain function. He said the wound was consistent with that of live ammunition, and that a metal bullet had penetrated the back of the right ear, and stopped on the left. At the time of writing, she remained in critical condition. The doctor identified another man, Soe Way, 20, who had also been treated at the hospital after being wounded at the same protest. The doctor said that Soe Way’s upper body wound was consistent with that of live ammunition. He is in stable condition., The United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials states that security forces use the minimum necessary force at all times. In dispersing violent assemblies, firearms may only be used when other less harmful means are not practicable but must still be used to the minimum extent necessary. Law enforcement officers may only intentionally make lethal use of firearms when strictly unavoidable to protect life., Overly Broad Restrictions on Protests, On February 8, 36 township authorities across 4 states and regions of Myanmar invoked section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to restrict gatherings to no more than five people and imposed curfews from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. Section 144 of the 1898 Code of Criminal Procedure is a broadly worded law that, on its face, gives a magistrate the authority to order individuals or the public to abstain from certain actions if, in the magistrate’s view, the order “is likely to prevent, or tends to prevent, obstruction, annoyance or injury, or risk of obstruction, annoyance or injury, to any person lawfully employed, or danger to human life, health or safety, or a disturbance of the public tranquillity, or a riot, or an affray.” Violation of such an order is punishable by up to six months in jail under section 188 of the Penal Code., Since seizing power, the military has repeatedlyrestricted access to the internet, including a second near-total nationwide shutdown of internet connections that lasted approximately 24 hours as demonstrators took to the streets on February 6., The broad ban on gatherings violates the right to peaceful assembly under international human rights law. As the UN Human Rights Council has recognized, the ability to exercise the right of peaceful assembly subject only to restrictions permitted under international law is indispensable to the full enjoyment of the right, “particularly where individuals may espouse minority or dissenting views.” The UN special rapporteur on the rights to freedom of assembly and of association has made clear that “freedom is to be considered the rule, and its restriction the exception.”, Restrictions on freedom of assembly need to be narrowly drawn to serve a legitimate purpose and restrict the right as little as possible. The total ban imposed in Myanmar is disproportionate to any legitimate state interest that might be served, Human Rights Watch said. Similarly, the imposition of criminal penalties on those who hold peaceful gatherings would be inconsistent with international norms that establish that no one should be held criminally liable for the mere act of organizing or participating in a peaceful assembly., Under international human rights standards, any internet-based restrictions must be provided for in law and be necessary and proportionate and pursuant to a legitimate aim. Internet shutdowns fail to meet these standards and hinder access to information and communications needed for daily life, which is particularly vital during times of crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. Restrictions also provide cover for human rights abuses, and complicate efforts to document government violations., Internet service providers should uphold their responsibilities under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights by resisting unjustified internet shutdowns. Service providers should insist upon a legal basis for any shutdown order, interpret requests to cause the least intrusive restrictions, and restore access as soon as possible., On February 4, the UN Security Council issued a statement expressing deep concern over the declared state of emergency and the arbitrary detention of the members of the democratically elected government in Myanmar, and called on the military to fully respect human rights. On February 8, the United Nations announced that the Human Rights Council will hold a special session on the situation in Myanmar on February 12. The council is expected to issue a resolution on the situation in Myanmar following the meeting., “Myanmar’s military has shown time and again that it is willing to resort to large-scale violence to quash dissent and remain in power,” Weir said. “UN member states urgently need to speak with one voice to warn the generals to end the use of lethal force and respect the right to peaceful protest, or face serious consequences.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-lethal-force-used-against-protesters

We see basic rights already coming under intense pressure and are concerned to see that space for civil society groups to safely organize and operate is quickly diminishing. The potential humanitarian consequences for already vulnerable groups, particularly those in conflict affected areas across the country, are incredibly worrying., We have worked in solidarity with and in support of our civil society partners in Myanmar for the past two decades. We remain as committed as ever to continuing this collective work in support of the rights and resilience of communities. Everyone should be able to live their life in safety, to be able to influence decision that impact them, and to live free from poverty., We call on all parties to refrain from violence and to respect human rights, including the freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and access to information. Those living in conflict areas and in other vulnerable situations need particular support and protection at this time.

Myanmar: New internet blackout “heinous and reckless”,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,6 Feb 2021,"Responding to credible reports of a widespread mobile internet blackout underway in Myanmar, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Campaigns, Ming Yu Hah, said:, “To shut down the internet amid a volatile coup, a humanitarian crisis and a health pandemic is a heinous and reckless decision., “Since the 1 February coup, people in Myanmar have been forced into a situation of abject uncertainty. An expanded internet shutdown will put them at greater risk of more egregious human rights violations at the hands of the military., “The military must re-establish all telecommunications immediately and stop putting people’s rights in danger.All mobile operators and telecommunications providers in Myanmar must seek urgent clarification from the Myanmar authorities.”, Background, On 6 February, the Myanmar military reportedly ordered telecommunications companies in the country to fully shut downinternet and 4G services. According to information received by Amnesty International, the effective blackout will be in operation until Monday 8 February., An earlier order, on 5 February, instructed telecommunications companies to block access to Twitter and Instagram.
On 4 February, the military had already announced that they were ordering telecoms operators to block access to Facebook until 7 February., As the 1 February military coup was underway, internet and phone outages were reported in several parts of the country, including in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, the largest city, Yangon, as well as Shan and Kachin States and the Mandalay and Sagaing regions. Access was later reestablished., There have also been mobile internet restrictions in conflict-affected areas of Rakhine and Chin States in the country for more than a year. 4G internet access in those areas was reportedly restored late in the evening on 2 February 2021., Such restrictions pose a real danger to at-risk civilian populations, especially when access to information is so vital during the COVID-19 pandemic – and even more so when the situation on the ground is so tense amid the coup, and in conflict-affected areas., Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, business enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights independent of state actions or obligations, and over and above compliance with national laws.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-new-internet-blackout-heinous-and-reckless
"Myanmar: End Crackdown on Media, Communications",News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,5 Feb 2021,"Journalists Threatened, Internet Restricted, Myanmar’s military junta should immediately lift internet restrictions, release all persons detained since the February 1, 2021 coup, and end harassment and threatened arrests of journalists, Human Rights Watch said today., Journalists in Myanmar have reported credible threats of an imminent, broader-sweeping crackdown on media workers, and several have told Human Rights that they fear for their safety., “A news and information blackout by the coup leaders can’t hide their politically motivated arrests and other abuses,” said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The military should immediately release those arrested, restore access to online information, and protect the right to free expression.”, On February 4, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) in Myanmar said that in addition to 133 officials and lawmakers whom the military detained at the onset of the coup, 14 activists had also been detained. On the morning of February 4, the authorities arrested 4 among about 20 protesters who had gathered outside the University of Medicine in Mandalay to oppose the coup. It is not yet known if those arrested have been charged. On February 5, the authorities detained Aung San Suu Kyi’s senior aide, Win Htein, 79, in Mayangone township. He is facing charges for his comments denouncing the coup., Human Rights Watch called for the lifting of the February 3 and February 5 orders issued by the Transport and Communications Ministry, now fully under the control of the military, directing the blocking of social media services. The government said it was barring the use of the service because people were using it to “trouble the country’s stability.”, On February 3, the ministry ordered all mobile communications operators, international gateways, and internet service providers to cut off access to social media services owned by Facebook at least until February 7. The order went into effect on February 4, when Facebook, its Messenger app, as well as Instagram and WhatsApp, which Facebook owns, all became inaccessible on mobile data networks for people with SIM cards from the telecommunications company MPT. Telenor, a Norway-based telecommunications company, issued a statement saying that it had complied with the order that had a “legal basis in Myanmar law,” but expressed “grave concern regarding the breach of human rights.” Facebook is the main source of news and information in the country and for many Myanmar people is synonymous with the internet., On February 5, the Council broadened the restrictions, ordering mobile communications operators, international gateways, and internet service providers to cut access to Twitter and Instagram. Disruptions to Twitter services were reported throughout the country and for numerous services providers. According to Netblocks, the service disruptions began on February 6 around 3 a.m. Instagram was already subject to restrictions under the previous directive at the time of the announcement., On February 5, Telenor issued another statement saying it also complied with the February 5 directive, which it noted did not have a date of expiration, stating it had “legal basis in Myanmar’s telecommunications law” and that Telenor had challenged “the necessity and proportionality of the directive.”, Under international human rights standards, any internet-based restrictions must be provided for in law and be necessary and proportionate and pursuant to a legitimate aim. Internet shutdowns fail to meet these standards and hinder access to information and communications needed for daily life, which is particularly vital during times of crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. Restrictions also provide cover for human rights abuses, and complicate efforts to document government violations., Internet service providers should uphold their responsibilities under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which says that companies should “[s]eek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts.” This means resisting unjustified internet shutdowns. Service providers should insist upon a legal basis for any shutdown order, interpret requests to cause the least intrusive restrictions, and restore access as soon as possible, Human Rights Watch said., On February 4, the United Nations Security Council members issued a statement expressing deep concern over the declared state of emergency and the arbitrary detention of the members of the democratically elected government in Myanmar. In calling for the release of those detained, the Security Council also urged Myanmar to “refrain from violence and fully respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.” The council also expressed concern over restrictions on civil society, journalists, and other media workers., “The Myanmar military has engaged in a naked power grab that if not reversed will set back democracy and the protection of human rights for a generation,” Adams said. “The coup was so appalling that even China, which has consistently protected military from condemnation at the Security Council, signed onto a call for the respect of fundamental freedoms. Governments should be clear-eyed about the military’s appalling human rights record and together demand the military abandon its wholesale assault on civilian rule, human rights, and the rule of law.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-end-crackdown-media-communications

We are deeply concerned about the potential humanitarian consequences of the current crisis for the well-being of children across the country, and express our solidarity with the people of Myanmar in this difficult moment.”, “This crisis comes at a time when armed conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic already pose severe challenges in Myanmar, especially for marginalized communities. Humanitarian organisations must have continued and improved access to the one million people requiring urgent humanitarian assistance in Myanmar this year, 383.000 of whom are children.”, “The official number of children in need of vital support is likely to be an underestimation, as the current COVID-19 crisis is having a devastating impact on children’s education, health, nutrition, psychosocial well-being and future prospects.”, “Most schools in Myanmar have been closed for nearly one year, which means that 9.7 million children have missed out on classroom-based learning.”, “The difficult situation for conflict-affected populations deserves special attention, particularly those from ethnic and marginalized minority groups across Myanmar, including displaced populations in Rakhine, northern Shan, Kachin and Kayin states. Children who live in camps often face precarious conditions and a very uncertain future.”, “We call on stakeholders to respect the rights of all people in Myanmar, including children and youth, especially when it comes to exercising their right to freedom of expression in different ways, without fear of repercussions., “We call on all parties inside Myanmar, the wider region and globally to take action and facilitate a swift and peaceful resolution of this crisis, while placing the best interests and future of children at the heart of their crucial efforts.”, For media requests, kindly reach out to:

UK Civil Society Joint Statement on The Prevention of Atrocities in Myanmar,News and Press Release,GW,Protection and Human Rights,5 Feb 2021,"Members of the UK Atrocity Prevention Working Group and its friends call upon Her Majesty’s Government to act swiftly, comprehensively and with conviction in response to the unjustifiable seizure of power from Myanmar’s fragile democracy., A robust, coordinated response, Having orchestrated genocide in Rakhine and faced little more than being banned from holidaying in the US, EU and UK, Min Aung Hlaing, head of the Myanmar military, is calculating there will be a similarly weak international response to this coup. It is essential that he is proven wrong., International coordination is vital and we welcome statements from the government that the United Kingdom will work with international partners to mobilise an international response. This should include targeted sanctions on military owned and controlled companies as recommended by the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, working with international partners to build a coalition of countries imposing arms embargoes against Burma, and support for international justice processes at the International Criminal Court and International Court of Justice., We support Her Majesty’s Government in its work with partners to bring about such a response., Leverage prevention capabilities, The UK Atrocity Prevention Working Group exists with the aim to help improve the UK's prediction and prevention of mass atrocities. We therefore raise serious and urgent concerns of the increased risks ethnic minorities, democracy and human rights activists, and independent journalists in Myanmar now face., In 2017, in its report on the UK response to the 2017 atrocities in Rakhine, the Foreign Affairs Select Committee was clear that ‘the FCO must now learn lessons on atrocity prevention from the crisis to apply to Burma and elsewhere.’ The government did not. The following year the Committee was stronger still; ‘Everything we have heard as part of this inquiry has strengthened our belief that an atrocity prevention strategy is now more vital than ever. The Government needs to act urgently to produce a comprehensive atrocity prevention strategy and implementation plan to ensure it moves beyond words and towards concrete actions.’, Atrocity risks were already high in Myanmar. Those risks have now worsened.
For us it is clear, unless this gap in UK policy is urgently and meaningfully addressed, the absence of a clear articulate strategy on identity-based violence, genocide and crimes against humanity will once again be to the detriment of Myanmar’s ethnic minority populations., We urge the Government, once and for all, to acknowledge that its current approach to conflict and instability is not sufficient and special focus must be paid to preventing the very gravest crimes that are, once again, a real risk for minority populations and activists in Myanmar., Accountability and justice, Until now, the international community has been too slow and too distracted to ensure that those who are most responsible for the crimes committed in Rakhine in 2017 are brought to justice. The alarming events of the past 48 hours bring into the sharp focus the need to join the case against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice and to refer the situation in the country to the International Criminal Court., We support HMG in calling on Myanmar’s military leaders to, • Immediately and unconditionally release all those currently arbitrarily detained;
• Allow Parliament to resume and elected MPs to fulfil their mandate without impediment
• Immediately restore the Internet and all forms of communications We urge HMG to
• Use all avenues to improve the immediate protection and safeguarding of rights activists, journalists, and local leaders
• Make good use of its new independent Human Rights Sanction Regime, and apply targeted, hard hitting sanctions on military owned and controlled companies, as recommended by the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar
• Work with regional power brokers, especially Japan, as well as the United States and its other allies to build a coalition of conscience that will coordinate in applying such sanctions and communicating with the military leadership
• This coalition should also work to increase the number of countries implementing arms embargoes against Myanmar
• Urgently undertake a comprehensive risk analysis for Rakhine and the whole country and closely monitor the indicators of identity-based violence, genocide, and crimes against humanity
• Leverage atrocity prevention capabilities across HMG, state partners and civil society to assess and closely monitor indicators of identity-based mass violence, genocide and crimes against humanity – indicators commonly missing from UK risk analysis frameworks
• Establish a cross-cutting emergency communications protocol connecting UK state partners and local civil society to act as an early warning system
• Prioritise humanitarian assistance to the victims of conflict and human rights violations by the military, including via cross-border mechanisms
• Work with social media companies, in particular Facebook, to suspend the accounts of USDP and military leaders that have used their platforms to spread disinformation, fear, and incitement to violence.

• Join the Gambia and other states by intervening in its case against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice. An announcement of intention to intervene does not need to wait until legal objections raised by Myanmar are resolved
• Publicly support the referral of the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court 2., At the UN Security Council, we urge the UK to;
• Continue to push for an open meeting, invoking the Uniting for Peace mechanism if China or other states continue to block efforts and so move the conversation to the General Assembly
• Invite the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar to brief the Council. If China blocks this then

Myanmar’s political crisis could spell humanitarian disaster if aid groups are restricted,News and Press Release,NRC,Protection and Human Rights,4 Feb 2021,"Reacting on the possible humanitarian fallout of the crisis, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) Jan Egeland, said:, “We are deeply troubled that Myanmar’s political crisis could spell humanitarian disaster for 1 million vulnerable people if aid organisations are further restricted in delivering relief across the country. People’s ability to access humanitarian assistance was already limited in conflict areas prior to this week’s state of emergency, including in Kayin, Rakhine, Kachin and Shan states, and across Bago Region., As we begin to assess the implications that these political developments could have on our operations, we fear that humanitarian needs may escalate rapidly and with devastating consequences if we experience any further clampdown on our ability to deliver aid., We appeal to the de facto authorities, international donors, ASEAN nations and to China, to ensure that humanitarian access and protection of all vulnerable groups is at the forefront of political and diplomatic attention in the days ahead.”, For more information or to arrange an interview:, Contact NRC's global media hotline on +47 905 62329 or email media@nrc.no.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-s-political-crisis-could-spell-humanitarian-disaster-if-aid-groups-are

Protection and Human Rights
Safety and Security",3 Feb 2021,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., MILITARY COUP IN MYANMAR POSES IMMINENT THREAT TO ALL CIVILIANS, The situation in Myanmar (Burma) remains tense after the military -- also known as the Tatmadaw -- seized power in a coup early on Monday, 1 February. The military's Commander-in-Chief, General Min Aung Hlaing, was placed in charge of the country. The coup began with the mass detention of various government officials from the National League for Democracy (NLD), including President U Win Myint, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and the chief ministers of all 14 states. The military have declared a state of emergency for a period of one year, with troops deployed in all of Myanmar's main cities., Myanmar's armed forces previously ruled the country from 1962-2011, overseeing the violent repression of the democracy movement and waging war against several ethnic armed groups. Despite the beginning of a transition to civilian rule in 2011, the military retained control of significant ministries within the government, maintained 25 percent of seats in parliament, and controlled large sections of the economy. Although the NLD overwhelmingly won the 2015 elections, enabling Aung San Suu Kyi to become de facto leader of the government, the Tatmadaw continued to commit atrocities., Myanmar is currently defending itself at the International Court of Justice against accusations of violating the Genocide Convention with regard to atrocities committed against the minority Rohingya population during ""clearance operations"" in Rakhine State during 2017. The UN's Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar has also accused the military of possible crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Kachin, Rakhine and Shan states., Monday's coup was launched in response to the NLD's victory in the November 2020 elections, where it comprehensively defeated military-backed candidates. The coup not only reverses progress made over the past decade, the reimposition of military rule poses a grave and imminent threat to all civilians across Myanmar., In response to the coup, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has urged ""the military leadership to respect the will of the people of Myanmar and adhere to democratic norms."" Meanwhile, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said that, ""decisive action is imperative, including the imposition of strong targeted sanctions, and an arms embargo."", The UN Security Council held a closed meeting to discuss Myanmar on Tuesday, 2 February, but issued no formal statement or resolution. Dr. Simon Adams, Executive Director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, has said that, ""General Min Aung Hlaing rightfully belongs at the International Criminal Court for atrocities that were previously committed under his command. The entire international community should now impose an arms embargo and targeted sanctions on all senior Tatmadaw officers. Military-controlled economic entities should also be sanctioned. The climate of impunity and inaction that has emboldened Myanmar's generals and led to the reimposition of military rule must end."", 'APOCALYPTIC' CRISIS MARKS 2ND ANNIVERSARY OF PEACE DEAL IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, On Saturday, 6 February, the Central African Republic (CAR) will mark the second anniversary of the signing of its ""Political Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation."" Despite the agreement being hailed as a historic achievement, the anniversary will be overshadowed by renewed fighting. Former Prime Minister Martin Ziguélé described the current crisis in the country as ""apocalyptic,"" citing daily violence perpetrated by an alliance of predatory armed groups, the Coalition of Patriots for Change (CPC). Fighters from the CPC currently have the capital, Bangui, encircled., Since the CPC launched their offensive against Bangui in December, 205,000 civilians have been forced to flee. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), armed groups are also present at sites where displaced communities are sheltering in Batangafo and Bria, posing serious risks to vulnerable civilians. Reports indicate that some of these armed groups continue to forcibly recruit or attack civilians on the basis of religious or ethnic identity. Boris Cheshirkov, spokesman for UNHCR, warned that, ""we hear about looting, sexual violence that is increasing rapidly and the situation is really worrying."", During December the Human Rights Division of the UN peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) documented numerous violations and abuses of human rights and international law, including killing civilians, sexual violence, torture, denial of humanitarian access and kidnappings. Armed groups who signed the 2019 peace agreement were responsible for 90 percent of these incidents. Many perpetrators of past atrocities also continue to hold command positions inside the CPC., The peace agreement aimed to end more than five years of endemic armed conflict in CAR. However, this latest violence threatens to undo any tentative progress made towards stability. The UN Security Council must ensure that the CAR government and MINUSCA have the military capacity to defend Bangui and protect civilians from further attack., IMPUNITY FOR WAR CRIMES IN SRI LANKA INCREASES RISK OF RECURRENCE, Last Wednesday, 27 January, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) warned that ongoing impunity for atrocities perpetrated during Sri Lanka's 1983-2009 civil war has put the country on an ""alarming path towards recurrence of grave human rights violations."", The armed conflict between the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) armed group was marked by grave human rights violations and abuses, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and sexual violence perpetrated by both sides. From January 2009 onwards, Sri Lankan government forces intensified their military offensive against regions of the country held by the LTTE and both sides are alleged to have perpetrated war crimes and crimes against humanity. In May 2009 the last LTTE-held areas of the country fell and the government declared victory., OHCHR's latest report highlights negative trends that have ""profoundly changed the environment for reconciliation, accountability and human rights"" in Sri Lanka since the end of the civil war. This includes the appointment of individuals implicated in alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity to senior military positions, such as the Army Chief and Secretary to the Ministry of Defense. OHCHR also noted increasing marginalization of the country's Tamil and Muslim minorities and divisive rhetoric from state officials., Discrimination and violence targeting Muslims has accelerated since the April 2019 Easter Sunday terrorist attacks that claimed the lives of 277 people. Muslim communities have also sometimes been blamed for the spread of COVID-19., Although the government initially supported some post-war accountability initiatives at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) -- including co-sponsoring several resolutions on ""promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka"" -- it failed to uphold its commitments. The government agreed to establish four transitional justice mechanisms, including a commission on truth, reconciliation and non-recurrence, and a judicial mechanism to investigate alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. More than a decade since the end of the war, neither the commission nor the judicial mechanism have been established and the government has failed to prosecute state agents implicated in war crimes., In support of the Sri Lanka report, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, said that, ""it is time for international action to ensure justice for international crimes."" Bachelet called on states to pursue potential prosecutions under the principle of universal jurisdiction and to consider targeted sanctions against alleged perpetrators. OHCHR also called on the HRC to support the creation of an investigative mechanism to collect and preserve evidence of atrocities in Sri Lanka.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-238-myanmar-burma-central-african-republic-and-sri-lanka
The Asia Pacific Partnership for Atrocity Prevention (APPAP) Members Statement on Myanmar,News and Press Release,APHR,Protection and Human Rights,3 Feb 2021,"The Asia Pacific Partnership for Atrocity Prevention (APPAP) is an alliance of organisations working to promote human rights and support atrocity prevention in the region., The undersigned members of APPAP express grave concern over the coup staged by the Tatmadaw on 1 February against the elected civilian government, which overwhelmingly won the elections in November 2020. The failure of the civilian government to address the military’s allegation of “widespread election fraud” served as a pretext for staging the putsch, which it claimed is in accordance with the military-drafted 2008 Constitution., After denying coup rumours the week before, the Tatmadaw staged the power grab on the day the new Parliament was scheduled to open. An early morning raid was carried out and senior NLD party officials including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint were detained. Arbitrary detention of civilians, including pro-democracy activists, have continued since. As NLD leaders and other civilians were detained, access to mobile phone and internet communication was shut down, TV and radio stations were unable to broadcast, and soldiers were deployed outside city hall in the main city of Yangon., The potential for widespread violence involving civilians is strong, and given the Tatmadaw’s previous atrocities against civilians, the Rohingya, and other marginalised groups, the risk of the military again targeting particular groups with impunity under the pretext of state security is cause for alarm., The Tatmadaw ignored the UN Secretary General’s call for electoral disputes to be resolved through established legal mechanisms; so too the warning last week from nations like Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States not to “impede Myanmar‘s democratic transition”. These states and other members of the UN have since issued strong statements of condemnation of the coup. For its part, the US will reportedly review its position on sanctions against Myanmar., The coup contravenes the principles of the ASEAN Charter and is a setback to Myanmar’s Roadmap to Democracy, which it promised to ASEAN. The Chair of ASEAN, Brunei Darussalam, underscored the principles in the ASEAN Charter such as “adherence to the principles of democracy, good governance, and respect for and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.” It also called for “dialogue and reconciliation, and a return to normalcy in accordance with the will and interests of the people of Myanmar.” While ASEAN members expressed deep concern over the situation, some members viewed the coup as an internal affair of Myanmar and invoked the organisation’s non- interference principle., Clearly, the coup staged by the Tatmadaw is a setback to the democratisation process in Myanmar and will no doubt further increase the risks of atrocity crime in the country. The emergency rule declared by the military solidifies its grip in the country without accountability, which could lead to an escalation of violence in conflict areas and systematic violation of human rights throughout Myanmar. This threatens to intensify the pre-existing impacts on regional human security resulting from atrocity crimes in the country., Elections can act as a trigger for violence and further atrocity crimes; when post-election disputes turn to violence and a military takeover, the likelihood of atrocities as well as attacks against perceived enemies and marginalised groups is heightened further. The military regime’s 4-month ban on all international and domestic flights, including humanitarian flights, exacerbates this threat., APPAP warned prior to the November 2020 election, in its Declaration on Myanmar, of a range of issues relating to the prospect of free and fair elections. These included a lack of transparency, arrests of government critics, and banning of foreign media. In addition, various minorities including the Rohingya were denied the right to vote even as elections were cancelled in parts of Rakhine and neighbouring states where ethnic armed groups were fighting government forces., The Tatmadaw’s emergency rule will have serious implications for the repatriation of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, the temporary ceasefire with the Arakan Army (AA) in Rakhine, and the peace negotiations with other ethnic armed organisations in various parts of the country. In addition, it may undermine both domestic and international efforts to hold the Tatmadaw accountable for atrocity crimes committed by soldiers against the Rohingya and other minorities in Rakhine in August 2017. It is unlikely that the military government will cooperate with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC) in genocide and atrocity crimes cases filed against Myanmar., The Responsibility to Protect principle obligates all states to protect their populations from atrocity crimes, including war crimes, ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity and genocide., APPAP urges the Myanmar military to:, APPAP calls on the international community, through ASEAN, the UN Security Council, and other international bodies, as well as democratic nations of the world to:, Signatories:

Had the Security Council acted decisively and strongly from day one, we might not be in a situation where the lives and liberty of people across Myanmar are now at even greater risk., “As we have said before, the Security Council must impose targeted financial sanctions against Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and other military leaders responsible for atrocity crimes against various ethnic minorities across the country, including the Rohingya. The Security Council must also impose a comprehensive global arms embargo on Myanmar, and crucially, refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court., “This is a critical time requiring immediate action from the Security Council, including holding an open session on Myanmar and unequivocally condemning the arrests and other human rights violations by the military. Finally, the Council must demand the immediate release of all those detained in Monday’s raids, if they are not promptly charged with a crime recognized under international law.”, Background, The UN Security Council will hold an emergency closed meeting on Myanmar on Tuesday 2 February at 10am EST in response to yesterday’s coup in Myanmar., Since yesterday the military has imposed a state of emergency under the authority of the Commander-in-Chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and has detained scores of elected civilian officials, other senior political figures as well as political activists and human rights defenders. Telecommunications blackouts have been imposed in parts of the country., In a 2018 report, Amnesty International named Senior General Min Aung Hlaing among those responsible for crimes against humanity perpetrated as part of a widespread and systematic attack against the Rohingya population in northern Rakhine State., Last year the military continued to commit serious human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law, including war crimes, against ethnic minority groups in Chin, Kachin, Rakhine and Shan States while eluding accountability. Amnesty uncovered evidence of indiscriminate air strikes that killed children, as well as torture and arbitrary detention., A UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar in 2018 has called for Senior General Min Aung Hlaing to be investigated and prosecuted for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-un-security-council-must-act-urgently-hold-military-accountable
Myanmar Lays Bare Challenges of Military-Led Democratization,Analysis,IPI,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",3 Feb 2021,"The Myanmar military (the Tatmadaw) dealt a significant blow to the prospects of democracy in the country when it staged a coup in the early morning of February 1. Just hours before a new parliament was to begin, the military detained dozens of leaders and activists from Myanmar’s largest political party, the National League for Democracy (NLD). The coup follows 12 years of a form of constrained, or bounded, democracy. In these 12 years, the NLD has dominated elections, but its relationship with the military has deteriorated., While the military’s coup dashes the hopes for further democratization in Myanmar, an examination of the history suggests full democratization was unlikely from the start. The military never intended for there to be democratic consolidation in the first place, and its actions, from the development of the 2008 constitution to yesterday’s coup, reveal that it refuses to sustain a system in which Aung San Suu Kyi’s NLD is the dominant party. After developing the 2008 constitution, the military tried to build a party that could represent the military’s interests, but the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) has failed to become a viable counterweight to the NLD., That the Tatmadaw staged a coup to prevent the NLD from governing with a second consecutive parliamentary majority also points to the limitations of what the international community can do. It is unlikely that the military will support full democratization until there is a party that the military trusts, which can also check the NLD., Challenges of Military-Led Democratization, To understand why the Tatmadaw would reverse a path of democratization it led itself, one should look first at the wariness of militaries towards democracy in general. My research shows that a military’s support for democracy is conditional on three factors: the degree of trust between the military and political parties; whether parties allied with the party are well-organized; and the electoral strength of these allied parties. When there are parties that the military trusts, which are well-organized and popular, the military becomes more confident that a shift towards democracy will not endanger its core interests., Alternatively, when militaries fear the prospects of an opponent winning elections, they often engage in what I call bounded democratization. Bounded democratization is when the military uses its power to set specific conditions on how democracy can function. This is most often done by engineering formal rules through the constitution that either curb the influence of the opposition or boost the power of the military’s allies., Using data on nearly 150 regime transitions following military rule since 1942, I coded the behavior of militaries during transitions to develop a measure of bounded democracy. With this data I found that militaries were more likely to bind democracy when parties they trusted were electorally weak or poorly organized., We can apply this directly to the case of Myanmar. Bounded democratization helps explain the Tatmadaw’s behavior in 2008 and can be linked to the latest coup. After an extended period of authoritarian rule following the military’s 1988 coup, the military considered democracy but was not confident that its interests would be secure in a democratic system., To protect itself, the military designed a constitution that ensured that it would maintain three critical ministries: Home Affairs, Defense, and Border Affairs. Additionally, the military also required that 25 percent of parliamentary seats would be reserved for the military while creating a rule that the constitution could not be amended with less than 76 percent of seats voting in favor—effectively granting the military veto power over any changes to the constitution. The military not only bound the system in its favor but also established a political party, the USDP, as a vehicle for former military officers and civilian allies to contest elections and challenge the NLD., While the military thought these protections would be sufficient, it underestimated the popularity of the NLD and the lack of support for the USDP. In the three elections since the new constitution was put in place, the NLD routed the USDP. Exacerbating the USDP’s poor performance is the military’s use of winter-take-all electoral rules, which gave the NLD 80 percent of the elected seats, despite winning only 57 percent of the vote., The relationship between the NLD and Tatmadaw has also deteriorated to the point where the military no longer sees the system it designed as being viable for its interests. Since the NLD’s impressive 2015 electoral victory, the relationship between the military and NLD worsened noticeably. In 2017, a close advisor to Suu Kyi was assassinated, likely by the military. In March 2020, Suu Kyi’s NLD pushed for changes to the constitution which would strip the military of its political powers., Given the poor relationship between the NLD and the Tatmadaw prior to the November 2020 elections, the latest election results which increased the NLD’s share of seats seem to have been a breaking point for the military. The military has claimed that there was significant electoral fraud and irregularities and has used these claims as pretext for the coup., In conducting this coup, the military is likely trying to reset the system and bargain from a position of greater strength after losing much of its leverage after three consecutive embarrassing losses at the ballot box. By detaining the leadership of the NLD on the eve of the opening session of parliament, the military clearly signaled it no longer tolerates the NLD’s strength in Myanmar’s representative institutions., What Can Be Done?, In response to the coup, the administration of US President Joseph Biden has threatened to reimpose sanctions. Sanctions and a coordinated response by the international community may have nudged the military towards greater democratic rights in the early 2010s, but ultimately these policies did little to resolve the core issue—the military’s fear of the NLD’s power. Targeted sanctions may impose some costs on senior officers, but they will fail to resolve the military’s concerns about its interests under a democratic system the NLD dominates., Sanctions are also unlikely to work because this is not simply a coup driven by Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing’s ambition. While he was set to retire this year due to legal requirements, the actions of the military and the timing of the coup reflect a more institutional role. The military successfully detained key leaders in the NLD and activists in the dead of the night in one fell swoop. It then mobilized to control the streets of the capital. Doing so requires careful planning and a high degree of cohesion in the military., Not only was the coup well-executed, but the timing suggests that the military was acting against the NLD, rather than at the behest of its chief officer. By conducting a coup on the eve of the new parliament, the military effectively prevented the NLD from controlling key political offices and invalidated the 2020 election. Until the military’s fears of the NLD are resolved it seems unlikely that the military will support genuine democratic reforms., While the international community’s options are limited, there are some potential strategies that may help aid Myanmar in a return to democracy which require thinking outside the box. One potential strategy focuses on supporting electoral reforms. Instead of using winner-take-all rules, proportional representation would help the military’s proxy party, the USDP, obtain more seats in parliament in line with its vote share. While this would reduce the number of seats of the NLD, it should help solve the NLD’s most immediate problem; getting the Tatmadaw back to the barracks and allowing the NLD to return to parliament., The international community could also help the USDP and NLD invest and develop party infrastructure. Recent research has shown that incumbent authoritarians are more likely to support democratization when they have a well-developed party that can compete in elections. Even though this approach would be somewhat unorthodox, it would address the military’s concerns while also being in line with the goals of democratization., Darin Self is a PhD Candidate at Cornell University. His research focuses on authoritarian incumbent parties, militaries, party systems, and democratization., Originally Published in the Global Observatory",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-lays-bare-challenges-military-led-democratization

Through their high turnout, the people of Myanmar expressed their strong belief in the democratic process in the general election on 8 November 2020. The election marked an important milestone in the country’s democratic transition. Any allegation of voting irregularities has to be settled within the proper legal and administrative channels. Overturning the choice of the people of Myanmar by force is illegal, against the principles of democracy and takes the country backwards., The EU has been a steadfast supporter of Myanmar’s civilian and democratic transition, its peace process and national reconciliation, and its inclusive socio-economic development. We call upon the military to immediately and without any conditions release the President, the State Counsellor and all those who have been arrested, exercise maximum restraint, restore telecommunications, and respect human rights, freedom of expression, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. We also call upon them to immediately end the state of emergency, restore the civilian government, to open the newly-elected Parliament, and to proceed with the subsequent appointments of the President, Vice-Presidents and of the new government. We stand ready to support dialogue with all key stakeholders who wish to resolve the situation in good faith, and to return to the constitutional order., The European Union expects that the safety of the citizens of both Myanmar and of its Member States be ensured at all times and will consider all options at its disposal to ensure that democracy prevails., Press contacts, Nabila Massrali Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy +32 2 29 88093 +32 460 79 52 44",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-declaration-high-representative-behalf-european-union

Myanmar: Military coup kills fragile democracy,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,1 Feb 2021,"Governments Should Press for Release of Detainees, Return to Civilian Rule, (New York) – Governments worldwide should together demand that the Myanmar military respect the results of recent national elections and relinquish power, Human Rights Watch said today. Military authorities are holding dozens of activists and National League for Democracy (NLD) officials incommunicado, raising concerns about their possible mistreatment in custody., On February 1, 2021, the Myanmar military arrested the civilian leaders of the national and state governments and announced a one-year “state of emergency.” The military arrested leader Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and several dozen other senior officials in early morning raids in the capital, Naypyidaw. The officials were in Naypyidaw for the lower house of parliament to convene after the November 2020 national elections, which the NLD won by a large margin. The military also detained NLD officials and civil society activists in other parts of Myanmar, and cut telecommunications and the internet., “Myanmar’s new military junta should immediately and unconditionally release all detainees, rescind the state of emergency, and recognize the duly elected parliament,” said Brad Adams, Asia director. “The global community should finally act in a coordinated and sustained way to defend the Myanmar people’s fundamental freedoms and right to choose their leaders, and impose targeted sanctions and other measures to reverse military abuses.”, The military has repeatedly alleged without evidence widespread election and voter irregularities during the November elections. It claimed that the Union Election Commission (UEC) and the NLD failed to address the concerns of opposition political parties, ethnic groups, and the military, and failed to “properly perform their duties but also neglected to conduct a free, fair and transparent election.” Although some voting irregularities were noted early in the process, domestic election observers in a joint statement on January 29 said the “results of the election were credible and reflected the will of the majority of the voters.”, On January 29, the military refused to rule out seizing control of the government, though it later said that it would abide by the constitution. On February 1, the military invoked an article of the military-drafted 2008 constitution that allows it to declare a state of emergency and take control of all three branches of government. Vice-President Myint Swe, a member of the military-backed opposition party, replaced President Win Myint after his arrest. As acting president, Myint Swe then signed the authorization for the declaration of the state of emergency, transferring power to the commander-in-chief, Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing. The military announced the state of emergency would last for one year, after which, it said, new elections would be held., The authorities should immediately end arbitrary limits on freedom of expression, information, assembly, and association, Human Rights Watch said. Everyone has the right to publicly assemble and peacefully protest against the military’s actions. The authorities should avoid using force to disperse protests, regardless of whether they deem the protests unlawful. The Myanmar military has a long history of using excessive force to crack down on peaceful assemblies, raising concerns about the risk to protesters of further violations, including to the health and safety of activists, journalists, and other critics of the military., The military junta cut internet and phone lines across large parts of the country, and throttled other communications such as 3G mobile networks prior to the military’s announcements on Myanmar state media. International law requires governments to ensure that any restrictions to information online are provided by law, are a necessary and proportionate response to a specific threat, and are in the public interest. Officials should never use broad, indiscriminate shutdowns to stop the flow of information or to infringe on people’s ability to express political views. By maintaining a blanket or even partial shutdown, Myanmar is contravening international human rights standards that require internet-based restrictions to be both necessary and proportionate., The military commander-in-chief, Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, is credibly and directly implicated in crimes against humanity committed during the military’s “clearance operations” against Rohingya Muslims in 2017, as well as war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during military operations against the Kachin, Shan, Rakhine, and other ethnic minorities., Several members of the military-installed government announced on February 1 are also credibly implicated in serious rights abuses. Lt. Gen. Tun Tun Naung, the junta’s appointee for border affairs, oversaw war crimes and serious abuses against civilians as the commander in Kachin State in 2013. Lt. Gen. Soe Htut, minister of home affairs since 2020, was previously on the European Union sanctions list for human rights abuses related to his role leading the military’s southern command. Gen. Mya Tun Oo, the new defense minister, has held the military’s third ranking role as the chief of general staff since August 2016, including during the 2017 ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya., Coordinated international and multilateral actions in response to the coup should include targeted economic sanctions on the military itself, its leadership, and its vast economic holdings, which provide the military with its revenue, as well as embargoes on military arms and equipment, Human Rights Watch said. Joint actions by concerned governments should be accompanied by clear statements about what the junta must do to avoid these measures, including immediately and unconditionally releasing all those arbitrarily detained, restoring democratic institutions that existed before the state of emergency, accepting the November election results, and convening the lower and upper houses of parliament., “China, Russia, Japan, and other countries have long blocked coordinated international action to promote rights, justice, and accountability in Myanmar, but they now should be pressed to reassess their failed policies,” Adams said. “The military’s outrageous assault on democracy, following atrocities against the Rohingya, should be a clarion call for the world to act as one to finally get the military out of politics and put the interests of Myanmar’s people ahead of all other considerations.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-military-coup-kills-fragile-democracy

Myanmar’s Military Should Reverse Its Coup,News and Press Release,ICG,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding

International actors should make clear in word and deed that there will be no business as usual until the elected government is restored. If protests break out, the military should act with maximum restraint., In a major blow to Myanmar’s fragile democratic transition, the army staged a coup d’état on 1 February 2021.

The Myanmar military, or Tatmadaw, justified overthrowing the elected government by citing alleged fraud in the 8 November 2020 election that saw the NLD win an overwhelming victory over the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP). The country’s election commission had firmly rejected those allegations last week, as international observers had previously done. The dramatic turn of events constitutes an immense setback for democracy in Myanmar, less than a decade after the country began to steer a course away from half a century of military rule. This reversal will almost certainly worsen the country’s already bleak humanitarian and economic outlook. Although the situation is calm at present, people may well take to the streets in the days ahead, raising the danger of violent crackdowns against protesters. The Myanmar military must act peacefully and with maximum restraint. The swift restoration of democratically elected, civilian authority is in the country’s interest and that of all its international partners., Hours before Myanmar’s newly elected parliament was to convene on the morning of 1 February, soldiers detained State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President U Win Myint, cabinet ministers, NLD central executive committee members, the chief ministers of Myanmar’s states and regions, and members of other political parties and civil society representatives. As soldiers conducted these targeted raids, the military also cut off internet and mobile telephone networks in the country’s political capital Naypyitaw and its economic capital Yangon, and took the state television channel off the air. In a statement read out on a military-owned channel, the army said it had detained the NLD leaders and officials on account of “election fraud” and was invoking the state of emergency provisions in the 2008 constitution, thereby transferring all executive, legislative and judicial powers to Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing for a period of one year. Because the constitution requires the president to invoke a state of emergency, the Tatmadaw designated Vice President U Myint Swe – a military-appointed ex-general – as interim president to order the transfer of power, thereby providing a veneer of purported constitutionality. In a later statement, the commander-in-chief’s office indicated that the military would appoint a new election commission, hold new elections and ultimately transfer power to the winning party., Tensions between the military and the government had been growing since the NLD’s landslide win in the 8 November general elections, in which the NLD secured an even stronger majority than in the historic 2015 polls, which were the country’s first open elections in decades. November’s contest saw the NLD win 83 per cent of parliament’s elected seats largely the result of Aung San Suu Kyi’s enormous popularity and a firm popular rejection of the military’s political role. The scale of the victory was a humiliation for the USDP, which was left with just 33 of parliament’s 476 elected seats. Ever since, the USDP has campaigned to discredit the vote, alleging that it was marred by irregularities. The army supported these accusations, with Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing throwing his personal weight behind them. The military claims to have identified more than ten million voter list errors, which it has incorrectly suggested implies fraud on a corresponding scale. International observers have asserted that the vote represented the will of the people., The coup, unless quickly reversed, will constitute a dramatic setback for Myanmar’s democratic progress. The country’s 2015 elections brought the NLD to power under a de facto power-sharing arrangement with the Tatmadaw, with the 2008 constitution reserving a quarter of parliamentary seats and three key ministries for the military. The cohabitation has since been uneasy but relatively stable, though the relationship between the country’s top two figures – Aung San Suu Kyi and Min Aung Hlaing – is known to be toxic. Due to retire in mid-2021, the commander-in-chief was open about his political ambitions, raising questions about what his post-retirement role could be during an NLD second term., If it stands, the military’s seizure of power will not only upend Myanmar’s slow and difficult democratic transition but also could lead to deadly violence. Although the situation appears calm for the moment, these events will inevitably provoke popular dissent. Aung San Suu Kyi’s reputation has greatly suffered abroad as a result of her handling of the Rohingya crisis, but she and her party remain immensely popular within Myanmar, and the increased freedom people have enjoyed since the end of military rule means that many will likely be more assertive in demanding their rights than they would have been ten years ago. Mass protests are a real possibility, as are military crackdowns on demonstrations., The risk of violence – and political and economic uncertainty created by the coup – can only work to the country’s detriment. The best next steps would be in a reverse direction. Although Myanmar’s newly self-appointed leadership appear little inclined to do so, they should release government leaders and others who have been detained, restore civilian rule by elected authorities, and respect the political freedoms, including freedom of expression, of all Myanmar’s people. Should protesters take to the streets, the Myanmar military should act peacefully and with maximum restraint., For their part, international actors should respond firmly and, to the extent possible, in a coordinated fashion, making clear that until power is returned to those whom the electorate legitimately and overwhelmingly chose to hold it, there can be no business as usual. Even those governments in East and South East Asia that, because of their own systems, are not inclined to be concerned about the status of democracy in Myanmar should appreciate that political turmoil and the associated risk of violence in Myanmar will compromise their ability to build mutually beneficial economic and security relationships. They should therefore urge calm. Governments that do not already have arms embargoes in place should impose them now to send a firm, immediate signal to Myanmar’s military that the 1 February coup is unacceptable. At this juncture, it is critical that international actors, particularly those who have influence through economic and security ties, make clear both rhetorically and practically that they will stand in solidarity with Myanmar’s people against an illegitimate action that can only worsen the country’s economic and humanitarian plight and raise the risk of destabilising violence.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-s-military-should-reverse-its-coup
Myanmar coup: UN expert calls for strong international response including sanctions and arms embargo,News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding

They are guilty of an assault on an emerging democracy and the people of Myanmar. Human rights and democracy champions are in detention and under siege. They need and they deserve the world to be standing with them, which makes a strong international response imperative.”, Andrews called on the international community to show resolve in denouncing the military’s actions, and to ensure those responsible for the country’s past human rights violations are held accountable., “Decisive action is imperative, including the imposition of strong targeted sanctions, and an arms embargo until such time as democracy is restored,” he added., “Elected leaders and champions of democracy are in detention and under siege. The onus is, thus, on the international community to hold the Tatmadaw responsible., “The seizure of military power over a democratically elected government casts a dark shadow once again over the country,” said Andrews. “The generals have created a climate of fear and anxiety., “The Tatmadaw must immediately restore democratic order, and return elected authorities to power. The military leadership must also fully respect and protect people’s rights to freedom of expression and assembly., “All detainees must be released immediately. We also call on the Tatmadaw to avoid any use of force against protesters or civilians, and to respect the rights of the people of Myanmar to peacefully protest and express their opposition,” Andrews said., On 31 January, Myanmar’s military seized all levers of power in the country, consolidating control over the legislative, judicial and executive branches of government and detaining the leadership of the civilian governmental authorities, including the State Counselor, Aung San Suu Kyii and President U Win Myint., In a video address on the military run TV channel Myawaddy, the military declared a State of Emergency and the taking of power for one year. It justified their decision indicating reports of electoral fraud by the Tatmadaw’s political ally, USDP. On 8 November 2020, Myanmar held general election which granted an overwhelming majority to the National League for Democracy (NLD), paving the way for greater reforms and democratic transition., Several members of the new parliament are reportedly being held under house arrest, while the whereabouts of the leader of NLD, Aung San Suu Kyi, and other senior leaders, are unknown., A heavy police presence is reported around Myanmar’s capital Yangon, and communication networks and internet connectivity, including mobile and Wifi, in Yangon and Naypyitaw have been largely shutdown., ENDS, Mr. Thomas Andrews (United States of America) is the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar.

Comment by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Myanmar,News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,1 Feb 2021,"GENEVA (1 February 2021) – I am gravely concerned about the situation in Myanmar following the removal of the civilian Government and the arbitrary detention of dozens of political leaders, human rights defenders, journalists, activists and others by the military today. I echo the Secretary-General’s call for the military leadership to respect the outcome of the elections., I am alarmed by reports suggesting that at least 45 people have been detained – including elected parliamentarians under confinement – and I call for their immediate release. There are also disturbing reports of journalists being harassed or attacked, and restrictions on the Internet and social media – which will restrict access to information and freedom of expression at this critical and frightening time for the people of Myanmar., Given the security presence on the streets in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, as well as in other cities, there are deep fears of a violent crackdown on dissenting voices. I remind the military leadership that Myanmar is bound by international human rights law, including to respect the right to peaceful assembly, and to refrain from using unnecessary or excessive force., I urge the international community to stand in solidarity with the people of Myanmar at this time, and for all States with influence to take steps to prevent the crumbling of the fragile democratic and human rights gains made by Myanmar during its transition from military rule., ENDS, For more information and media requests, please contact:

Protection and Human Rights",28 Jan 2021,"This Situation Update describes the situation in Dwe Lo Township, Mu Traw District during the period between August and October 2020. It describes how the local villagers are dealing with the COVID-19[1] situation, the new prevention measures that they need to follow, and the livelihood difficulties they face as a result of the pandemic. Travel restrictions have increased due to a local case of COVID-19, however, villagers have been able to continue education for their children. Political parties have been campaigning in some areas as part of the 2020 general election. Fighting also broke out due to Tatmadaw[2] activities in restricted areas, which raises concern on the part of local villagers.[3], Introduction, This situation update is about the situation in Dwe Lo Township, Mu Traw District from August 4th 2020 to October 9th 2020. The main issues are related to the 2020 election, Tatmadaw activities, livelihood difficulties, COVID-19 and education., 2020 general election, There are five parties running in the 2020 elections in Mu Traw District. They are:, The parties mentioned above have been visiting the local areas and doing campaigning. UDP (Hnin Si) party told the local villagers that if they win the election, they will work for the local villagers to have a better situation [development, economy, stability] than in Singapore [which was previously less developed than Myanmar, but is now doing better than Myanmar]. KNDP said that they will help the Karen people know [their culture and history] and understand themselves [build understanding amongst themselves], and [will ensure that] Karen people [are able to] decide their own destiny. Those parties campaigned in Hsaw Klee Loh, Hker Hkoh, Pweh Pah and places near Hpapun Road., Livelihood difficulties, In August 2020, some farmers had not finished growing [and harvesting] their paddy plants yet. Those who had finished were not happy because their paddy plants died due to drought, even though the paddy [initially] sprouted well. The plants did not have enough water to grow after they sprouted. There was some water left in the farms and irrigation channel, but the water in the irrigation channel was at the bottom [was very low], and could not reach the farms. By September, the paddy plants' leaves were turning sallow. Certain places in the following village tracts[7] did not get enough rain: Htee Th'Daw Hta, Meh Pree, Kyaw Pah, Day Wah village tracts in Bu Tho Township and Lay Moh Hta, K'Ter Tee, Htee Th'Bluh Hta, Ma Htaw, Nah Koe Hkee, Hkoo Thoo Hta, Waw Muh, Meh Thuh Hta village tracts in Dwe Lo Township. The local villagers are now worried that they will face a rice shortage., Tatmadaw activities, In August 2020, a Tatmadaw battalion under Military Operations Command (MOC) #8,[8] which is based in Dwe Lo Township, Mu Traw District, did not follow the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) Code of Conduct[9] and trespassed into restricted areas.[10] As a result, fighting broke out on August 28th 2020 between this Tatmadaw battalion from K'Ser Ther Pler army camp, led by Captain Thu Rain Aung, and Karen National Liberal Army (KNLA)[11] Brigade #5, Battalion #102, Company #3. The fighting happened at the foot of K'Ser Ther Pler Mountain in the local villagers' farms. The local villagers worry that they will face travel and livelihood difficulties if the fighting continues to break out., COVID-19 situation, On March 17th 2020, healthcare workers from the Karen Department of Health and Welfare (KDHW)[12] from Mu Traw District provided awareness training to the local villagers on how to protect themselves and [instructed them] to wash their hands at least 4 times a day and for at least 20 seconds per time. Restrictions were placed on gatherings and meetings, and participants must stay 3 feet [0.9 metres] away from each other. The quarterly meeting of the district administrators was held from December 16th to 18th 2020, and although it normally lasts four days, this time it wrapped up within two and a half days. The discussion focused on the Salween Peace Park., Villagers were instructed to return to their township by March 18th 2020 because travel restrictions and the banning of public gatherings had started to take place. Screening checkpoints were also established to check for COVID-19. Before the screening checkpoints were established, the district administrator, leaders and healthcare workers made an announcement to let the villagers know. They told the villagers to be prepared and make sure they have enough food supplies to last three months. Some villagers have experienced food problems [shortages] so the leaders have allowed them access to [buying] food two days a week, on Mondays and Fridays only., In September 2020, one person from K'Ma Maung Town tested positive for COVID-19; three other households found nothing [were tested but the results were negative]. The Myanmar Police Force (MPF) is monitoring them because they are not allowed to go to public areas or crowded areas. Because of this local COVID-19 case, the screening checkpoints started to get more restrictive on September 20th 2020. Nevertheless, no new screening checkpoints have been set up., The screening checkpoint at Nya Bweh Day village, Htee Th'Blu Hta village tract was moved to a location between Htee Th'Blu Hta village and the top of K'Pee Road. The T'Dwee Hkoh screening checkpoint is still in Ma Htaw village. Anyone who comes back from outside of Mu Traw district has to go into quarantine for 21 days. There are two quarantine sites; one is next to T'Dwee Hkoh clinic in Ma Htaw village tract and the other is next to Wah Tho Klah clinic in Htee Th'Blut Hta village tract., The KDHW and local district healthcare workers set up a screening checkpoint for COVID-19 but the Myanmar government does not approve of it and they do whatever they want [government officials and soldiers are refusing to have their temperature checked when they pass through]. Although one person tested positive in September 2020, there is no other sign of the virus spreading. Three families are in quarantine and are being watched by the MPF so that they do not circulate in public. The local villagers are afraid that the virus will spread and that there will be a [full] ban on travelling, which will cause them to starve., Education, The schools in the villages mentioned above are operating without any problems [without curriculum changes, but are following COVID-19 prevention measures]., Policies/decisions made by the KNU to curb the spread of COVID-19 (September 20th 2020), 1. People who come back from outside of Mu Traw District have to quarantine for 21 days.
2. Parents should not ask their children (students or those who have gone to work in other places [other districts or countries]) to come back from these other areas.
3. There will be a one-month travel restriction [ban] due to COVID-19.
4. Two more screening checkpoints will be set up in K'Pee Hkee and Htee Th'Blu Hta villages.
5. Meetings and schools can go on as usual. If the students are sick, get a fever or a cold, the guardians/teachers must contact the relevant leaders/responsible persons.
6. People who are working for NGOs [and CBOs/CSOs] have to follow the procedures/policies (do their work and go to their workplace directly). They should not stop or take extra time on their way in.
7. Every COVID-19 checkpoint has to carefully check travel letters. People who do not have a travel letter or a specific reason for travelling are not allowed to travel at all.
8. If people who come back from work or other places outside the district do not follow the local policies, the village leaders have to inform the security guards right away. The security guard leaders will take action immediately., Composition of the [KNU] COVID-19 prevention committee in Htee Th'Blu Hta village, Two Quarantine Sites, Htee Th'Blut Hta village tract, near Wah Tho Klah clinic.
Ma Htaw village tract, near T'Dwee Hkoh clinic., There is no [COVID-19] committee in Ma Htaw village itself [because the quarantine site is in the larger village tract]., Conclusion, In the previous situation update (from May to July 2020), the virus had not yet reached K'Ma Maung Town. But it has now reached areas in Mu Traw District so the healthcare workers and the district leaders are taking more restrictive actions to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. The local villagers are also afraid that this virus will spread around them and that there will be increased restrictions on their travel, along with school closures that will create delays for the students., Again, in looking at the previous reporting period, there were no problems with the paddy plants. Now the paddy plants and the leaves are becoming sallow and dying., There have also been issues with Tatmadaw soldiers not following the terms of the NCA. The local villagers worry that if conflict increases, they will face many problems.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/mu-traw-district-situation-update-2020-general-election-livelihood-difficulties

To better understand production challenges, Mercy Corps’ Market Analysis Unit (MAU) interviewed farmers about the 2020 paddy and winter crop seasons. Data collection included phone interviews during January 6-9 as well as key informant interviews (KIIs) the following week. The study used a convenience sample of 162 farmers (74% paddy farmers and 96% winter crop farmers) from six townships, including Kyauktaw, Minbya, Mrauk U, Pauktaw, Ponnagyun and Sittwe. The data represent a fourth-round panel of the same respondents interviewed monthly since October., Key Highlights, Challenges from COVID and conflict declined for a second straight month as farmers observed less military activity and confidence in the pandemic response grew., One in five respondents expected challenges from pests to worsen in January amid unusually mild temperatures and the approaching winter crop harvest., Half of respondents struggled to find farm labor and some suffered lost yields amid a tough labor market and workers’ concerns about landmines., Respondents reported 3-5% higher paddy prices in January, and one-third said they expected better 2020 profits than 2019 (one-third also expected worse profits)., Half of winter crop farmers sold yields in January, boosted by improved mobility which increasingly enabled traders to reach villages., Many winter crop farmers (42%) expected oversupply and falling prices next month as peak-harvest sets in during late-January and February., Persistent labor shortages will not likely be solved by ceasefire alone but will instead require responses to displacement, landmines and other root causes., Winter crop profits are likely to drop off slightly in February as supply increases.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/mercy-corps-market-analysis-unit-snapshot-farmers-perspectives-paddy-and-winter-2

On 31 March 2020, the National-level Central Committee for COVID-19 Prevention, Control and Treatment was formed with the Chairmanship of State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Myanmar. A second committee, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Control and Emergency Response Committee was setup on March 30 led by the Vice President 1 to help with stricter administrative measures to control the spread of the virus including quarantining migrant workers coming from neighbouring countries., Myanmar has 127,582 confirmed COVID-19 cases (2,766 deaths and 110,809 discharged) as of January 5, 2021. Local transmissions have been rapidly increasing in Rakhine State and Yangon Region in August 2020. Semi lockdown with stay-at-home instruction was issued for entire Rakhine State starting August 27, and for all townships except the isolated Cocogyun Township (located on a far island) in Yangon Region starting September 21.
Factories, especially in the garment sector, were instructed to close temporarily until October 21 which was relaxed on October 12 among all factories if they met Grade-A in preparation for virus prevention measures., The Myanmar government has developed the COVID-19 Economic Relief Plan (CERP) consisting of seven goals, 10 strategies, 36 action plans and 76 actions that cover a range of emergency fiscal and monetary measures.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",27 Jan 2021,"(Yangon, 27 January 2021): The United Nations and humanitarian partners have issued the 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), which seeks to mobilize US$276.5 million for humanitarian assistance and protection services for around 945,000 people in Kachin, Kayin and eastern Bago, Rakhine and southern Chin as well as northern Shan., “The HRP explains how we aim to provide comprehensive humanitarian support to those who need it most,” said the UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for Myanmar, Mr. Ola Almgren, adding that the HRP places protection and respect for human rights at the center of an inclusive response effort., The 2021 HRP builds on partnerships with national partners and local civil society actors, that were strengthened as the humanitarian response adjusted to new operational realities in 2020 due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The plan also seeks to strengthen links with longer-term development planning frameworks. “With an estimated 336,000 displaced people in locations covered by the HRP, of whom some 250,000 are in situations of protracted displacement, supporting progress towards durable solutions, in close coordination with local partners and the Government of Myanmar, will also be critical,” added Mr. Almgren., “We are grateful to the donors and member states for their continued engagement and support over the years” said Mr. Almgren, noting that generous financial support has allowed the response to adapt to an often unpredictable situation on the ground, not least due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, US$185 million was mobilized through the HRP, representing 67 per cent of total funding requirements, including the COVID-19 response in humanitarian settings. This has made a real difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in conflict-affected areas. Close to one quarter of a million people in humanitarian settings were able to access essential healthcare services. Some 930,000 people received food assistance and 200,000 were reached with specialized protection services. Humanitarian organizations also provided nutrition support to more than 83,000 children and women, and shelter and essential household items for close to 240,000, as well as enabling access to safe drinking water for around 390,000 people and providing critical educational assistance for more than 75,000 boys and girls., Despite these and other efforts, very significant humanitarian challenges remain to be addressed in 2021. “We need to build on what we have learned in 2020 and work closely with the authorities and local partners to further extend our reach this year. A key part of this is ensuring safe and predictable access to those in greatest need of our help,” said Mr. Almgren., End, [Click here]https://reliefweb.int/node/3707750)* to read the 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan.*, Media contacts:, Aye Win, UNIC Yangon/ UNRCO wina@un.org, Mobile: +95 9421060343, Valijon Ranoev, OCHA Myanmar ranoev@un.org, Mobile: +95 979700781",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/one-million-people-conflict-affected-areas-myanmar-need-humanitarian-assistance-enmy

Humanitarian organizations estimate that more than 1 million people are currently in need of some form of humanitarian support, due to armed conflict, vulnerability to natural hazards, inter-communal tensions or other factors. The expanding impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated the lives of people in humanitarian settings across the country., More than 336,000 people in Myanmar are internally displaced, of whom a majority are in situations of protracted displacement in Rakhine, Kachin, Kayin and Shan states. Smaller-scale displacement has also taken place in eastern Bago Region. The launch of a National Strategy on Resettlement of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and Closure of IDP Camps in November 2019 has provided new opportunities for dialogue around durable solutions, although significant challenges remain, including insecurity and conflict, limited availability of essential services in return or potential resettlement areas, landmine contamination and complex issues around housing, land and property rights., Overall levels of humanitarian need have increased over the past year due to an expansion of armed conflict in Rakhine and southern Chin, with intense fighting frequently taking place in and around populated areas over the first half of 2020. This conflict has caused significant additional internal displacement since early 2019, with more than 100,000 IDPs reported as of November 2020, according to government and other sources. This rapid increase in new internal displacement has in addition compounded challenges for host communities who are in many cases also directly affected by the conflict itself, including due to growing landmine and unexploded ordnance contamination., In addition to the above, discrimination and marginalization continue to exacerbate and drive vulnerability, particularly among hundreds of thousands of stateless Rohingya in Rakhine State who – more than eight years after inter-communal violence caused widespread internal displacement and more than three years after security operations forced hundreds of thousands of others to flee across the border into Bangladesh – still face significant challenges in accessing basic healthcare, education and livelihoods due to restrictions on freedom of movement, inter-communal tensions and other factors, prolonging reliance on humanitarian assistance. Approximately 130,000 people, of whom the majority are Rohingya, have remained displaced in the central part of Rakhine since 2012, mostly in camps or camp-like settings. More than 860,000 Rohingya refugees – of whom more than 700,000 fled Myanmar since 2017 – remain in Bangladesh., The situation in the northern part of Shan State remains precarious due to volatile and unpredictable security dynamics which have continued to cause temporary displacement of civilians, albeit at lower levels than seen in Rakhine, and to complicate the return of the estimated 9,700 people in longer-term IDP camps in the area. Despite an absence of largescale clashes in Kachin State since mid-2018, close to 96,000 people remain in IDP camps set up after fighting broke out in 2011, of whom roughly 40,000 are in areas controlled by non-state armed actors. Civilians also continue to be affected by conflict in parts of Kayin State, as well as adjoining areas of Bago Region., The rapid increase in locally-transmitted COVID-19 cases across the country from mid-August 2020 has further complicated an already challenging humanitarian situation, with Rakhine State emerging as a key epicenter, in addition to Yangon Region which has seen the largest number of cases. As of November, the Ministry of Health and Sports was reporting more than 80,000 cases and 1,750 fatalities across the country. The Government, both at Union and state levels, rapidly implemented a number of measures to contain the spread of the virus, including in humanitarian settings. However, some of these measures have resulted in an extended disruption of humanitarian assistance in Rakhine State in particular.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-2021-humanitarian-needs-overview-january-2021

Water Sanitation Hygiene",27 Jan 2021,"Foreword by the Humanitarian Coordinator, The present Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) seeks to mobilize assistance for close to 945,000 people in 2021, in support of the efforts of the Government of Myanmar to aid those affected by humanitarian crises and challenges in different parts of the country. As has been the case for previous years, the HRP places protection at the centre of an inclusive response tailored to the particular needs of the most vulnerable women and men, girls and boys., The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 further demonstrated the critical importance of localization in Myanmar. In 2021, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) will build on the partnerships with national NGOs and local civil society actors that were strengthened as we adjusted to new operational realities in 2020. We will redouble our efforts to put in place robust channels for systematic two-way dialogue and engagement with affected people, and to capitalize on innovations around cash and voucher assistance to further extend our reach., Humanitarian partners remain committed to contributing to the achievement of durable solutions for displaced people. The National Strategy on Resettlement of Internally Displaced People (IDPs) and Closure of IDP Camps provides a key entry point in this regard. Progress on implementation of the Strategy in 2020 was slowed down by COVID-19 but new opportunities are emerging. Our efforts in this regard in 2021 will seek to create new links across the humanitarian-development nexus, while remaining firmly anchored in the perspectives and concerns of displaced people themselves. In Rakhine, the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State will continue to be an important reference point for engagement between humanitarian organizations and the Government of Myanmar., Our dialogue with the authorities will continue to emphasize the importance of humanitarian access, so that needs can be fully assessed and analyzed, humanitarian activities can be prioritized on the basis of those needs, and the impact of our efforts can be effectively monitored. The Myanmar HCT remains committed to working in accordance with the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, and without any adverse distinction based on region, ethnicity, religion or citizenship status., The financial support of donors for this HRP remains critical. On behalf of the broader humanitarian community, I would like to emphasize our sincere appreciation for the sustained, generous support provided by a diverse group of donors for humanitarian action in Myanmar. We hope to be able to continue to rely on the shared sense of urgency and spirit of partnership that lie behind this as we seek to mobilize the $276 million required for the 2021 HRP.
We look to 2021 with a clear understanding of the challenges that lie ahead, but with optimism that these challenges can be addressed, as Myanmar continues on its path of political, economic and social change., Ola Almgren United Nations Resident Coordinator Humanitarian Coordinator, Response Plan Overview, Myanmar continues to grapple with deeply rooted humanitarian challenges. The escalation of conflict in Rakhine and southern Chin states in 2020 has resulted in further civilian casualties, displacement, and disruption of essential systems and services., More than 336,000 people have been displaced from their homes in different parts of the country, of whom some 250,000 are in situations of protracted displacement. An estimated 600,000 Rohingya1 who remain in Rakhine State, of whom some 126,000 are effectively confined to camps or camp-like settings established in 2012, continue to be unable to move freely. The expanding impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated the lives of people in humanitarian settings. In total, approximately 1 million people have been identified as being in need of humanitarian assistance., The Myanmar Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) recognizes the primary role of the Government of Myanmar in the initiation, organization, coordination, and implementation of humanitarian assistance within the country, and its responsibility to respond to needs. Humanitarian organizations remain fully committed to working with government partners at all levels., The 2021 Myanmar Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) has been developed under the leadership of the United Nations Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator (RC/HC), to support the government-led response to needs, on the basis on the 2021 Myanmar Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO). It provides a framework for coordinated, needsbased and prioritized humanitarian action in Myanmar in 2021. Its overarching goal is to ensure that the health and wellbeing of people affected by conflict or disasters in targeted locations is improved, that minimum living standards are ensured, that durable solutions in line with international standards are supported wherever feasible, and that respect for the rights of affected people is enhanced., To achieve this, the HCT has agreed on the following strategic objectives for humanitarian action in 2021:, (1) The overall health and wellbeing of 942,800 people affected by conflict or disasters in targeted locations is improved and enjoyment of their rights is enhanced in 2021; and (2) Living standards of 886,000 people affected by conflict or disasters in targeted locations are improved and their resilience is strengthened in 2021., Geographically, this HRP focuses on Kachin, northern Shan, Rakhine, southern Chin and Kayin states, and parts of eastern Bago Region, where humanitarian needs are currently most acute and urgent. Targeted population groups include internally displaced people (IDPs); recently returned, resettled or locally integrated IDPs; non-displaced stateless people (in Rakhine State); and other vulnerable, crisis-affected people (including within host communities). Under the framework of the HRP, humanitarian organizations will require some US$276.5 million to provide relief assistance and protection services to approximately 944,000 people until the end of 2021., This HRP prioritizes the provision of life-saving assistance and protection for the most vulnerable crisis-affected women, men, boys and girls, and programmes to ensure equitable access to essential humanitarian services, without discrimination. It provides for targeted preventative and response activities relating to COVID-19 in humanitarian settings. It seeks to contribute to durable solutions to internal displacement in line with international standards. It also seeks to strengthen the resilience of communities and contribute to efforts to address vulnerabilities and underlying structural issues, in partnership with development and peacebuilding partners. The HRP includes activities to build national and local capacities to prepare for and respond to natural hazards and other emergencies in targeted locations. Dialogue with the Government of Myanmar on strengthening emergency response preparedness will continue. In the event of a large-scale natural disaster, the HCT will review and, where required, revise the scope of the response in consultation with the Government of Myanmar and other partners., The HCT recognizes that humanitarian action is a critical component of a broader, longer-term engagement that is needed to address a range of humanitarian, development, human rights and peacebuilding challenges in Myanmar. To this end, this HRP aims to complement other relevant strategies and frameworks including the UN COVID-19 Country Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP) and the UN Socio-Economic Response Framework to COVID-19 (SERF). Alongside the 2021 HRP, which incorporates COVID-19 response priorities in humanitarian settings, these plans provide for comprehensive international support for the whole-of-country and whole-ofsystem response to COVID-19 that is being led by the Government of Myanmar., This HRP also seeks to support relevant government plans such as the National Strategy on Resettlement of Internally Displaced People (IDPs) and Closure of IDP Camps, the Multi-Sectoral National Plan of Action for Nutrition, the Ministry of Education’s Emergency Preparedness and Response Framework and the Action Plan on COVID-19 in IDP Camps developed by the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement. In addition, the tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in June 2018 between the Government of Myanmar, UNDP and UNHCR, which has been extended until June 2021, aims to support the Government’s efforts to establish conditions for the voluntary, safe and dignified and sustainable repatriation of refugees from Bangladesh, and strengthening resilience and livelihoods for all communities living in Rakhine State., In all aspects of its work, the HCT is committed to ensuring that humanitarian action in Myanmar is carried out in accordance with the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-response-plan-2021-january-2021

Myanmar: Education for students with special needs,News and Press Release,Lutheran World Federation,Education,22 Jan 2021,"LWF project enables Rohingya children with disabilities to attend school, (LWI) – Going to school is difficult for the about 30,000 internally displaced Rohingya children in Myanmar’s Rakhine state. Even more, if the child is living with a disability: Teachers lack special training, and overcrowded classes make it hard to attend to particular needs. Two new projects by The Lutheran World Federation (LWF), working together with Humanity and Inclusion, Plan International, Save the Children, and Muslim Aid UK, aim to identify special needs for children in the camps and give them the chance to access education for the first time., Ah Nauk Ywe camp, Rakhine State, Myanmar. Humanitarian organizations have frequently raised awareness about the IDP camps’ living conditions for Rohingya and displaced Rakhine., Struggling to survive, Fifteen-year-old Showkat* has never been to school. The girl cannot speak and has difficulty walking and using her hands. “We tried once in kindergarten, but the teachers couldn’t care for her as they have to watch so many children,” her mother, Arefa, says., Showkat and Arefa are just two of over 144,000 Rohingya in Central Rakhine State who lost their homes due to violent outbreaks. Since 2013, Showkat, her parents, and seven siblings have lived in Ah Nauk Ywe camp, a temporary settlement for internally displaced people (IDPs). The family shares two rooms., The IDP camps in Rakhine state are challenging for any child: overcrowded houses, open fires, and inadequate sanitation pose many dangers. The 30,000 children of school-going age are mostly unable to access formal education outside the camps. They attend Temporary Learning Centres (TLCs), supported by non-governmental organizations such as LWF, and staffed by volunteer teachers with no formal teaching qualifications., No formal education, For children with special needs, the opportunities are even more limited. The family has little assistance in caring for their child; mother and sister are the principal caregivers for the 15-year-old. Showkat can communicate with her family. She noticed how other children go to school and repeatedly asked to go. Arefa is concerned about how the girl will fare without family assistance in everyday tasks. “She wants to go to school, but I don’t know what she needs for her education.”, Yunus*, the Head Teacher of five TLC in Ah Nauk Ywe IDP camp, knows about Showkat and other students like her. “We have around fourteen students who have similar conditions,” he says., The teacher would like to open a class for them but does not know where to start. “We will need qualified teachers,” he says. “It would be great if we had a proper classroom, together with physical assistance and mental support for them.”, Quality education for all, A project funded by the Australian Humanitarian Partnership (AHP) will provide exactly that. It will help teachers and communities identify children with special needs and map the challenges these children face when accessing education. They will then plan how to overcome those challenges., “These could include physical improvements to TLC structures, the provision of assistive devices, and training for teachers on how to identify and support children with disabilities who are already in their classrooms,” says Phyu Zin Thet Naing, LWF Education Officer in Rakhine., The project also features an accelerated learning program of informal primary and middle school education for over-age students like Showkat. The program, which allows older students to proceed faster with the curriculum, will eventually integrate them into mainstream schooling., Showkat and her mother in front of the camp’s primary school. Currently, even those Temporary Learning Spaces are closed because of COVID-19, Showkat and the other students will have to wait for their first day in class though. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all schools in Rakhine State are closed. To avoid losing time, LWF is working to adapt home-based learning materials produced by the Myanmar Ministry of Education to make them more inclusive for students with disabilities., For Showkat and her family, these projects will make a big difference. “The new projects aim to ensure that children affected by conflict in Central Rakhine State receive quality, inclusive, safe, and protective education that is supported by communities and governments,” says Jessica Gregson, LWF Education Coordinator in Rakhine., “We hope that the development of home-based learning materials for COVID-19 will provide an opportunity for out-of-school children, including those with disabilities, to engage with education for the first time, possibly offering a route into formal learning”, Gregson adds., The AHP project started in June 2020 and runs for 30 months. LWF is implementing it, together with Save the Children and Plan International. These three organizations are responsible for the provision of education in IDP camps in Central Rakhine State, with support from Humanity and Inclusion (HI), and input from Muslim Aid-UK., The MHF project started in January 2021 and runs for 12 months. It is being implemented by LWF and Humanity and Inclusion (HI).",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-education-students-special-needs

UNICEF Myanmar Statement on the fatal explosion of an ordnance in Minbya Town [EN/MY],News and Press Release,UNICEF,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",12 Jan 2021,"Yangon, 12 January 2021 – UNICEF Myanmar expresses deep sorrow over the reported death of a woman and the injury of five children, following the detonation of an unexploded bomb found at a farm near Sa Par Htar village, northeast of Minbya Town, Rakhine State, on 10 January., UNICEF remains deeply concerned about the alarming increase in child deaths and injuries by landmines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) in Myanmar. Between January and September 2020, 56 children were severely injured, and 13 children died from explosion of landmines and UXOs., More than one third of the reported casualties from landmine and UXO explosions in Myanmar are children; Rakhine State has the highest rate of reported child casualties with children accounting for 47 per cent of the total. Between January and September 2020, 49 children were killed and 134 maimed as a direct result of the conflict in Myanmar. This is more than the total casualties of 2019 or 2018., The safety and rights of children must be the primary consideration in all contexts. Landmines and UXOs often result in civilian casualties, with children the most vulnerable. Since children are smaller than adults, they are more likely to take the full impact of the blast and are therefore more likely to suffer death or serious injury., UNICEF urges all parties to the conflict to stop laying mines and to clear existing mines and unexploded ordnance to ensure the safety of children caught up in conflict, and to uphold their right to protection., UNICEF also urges the Government of Myanmar to facilitate access for the provision of emergency Mine Risk Education activities so that children and other community members receive psychosocial support and mine risk education in schools and communities in all conflict-affected areas of Myanmar., Our thoughts go to the families of the victims and to all children who remain in harm’s way., Media contacts, Guy Taylor

Some 130,000 people fled their homes in search of safety, sheltering in overcrowded camps without access to healthcare, education, or the means to earn a living., Islamic Relief has been a lifeline, providing food, shelter and clean water for thousands of people living in camps, and supporting many communities., Life-changing support, We distributed 2,400 food packs to displaced people living in camps in the Sittwe township, helping almost 20,000 people. We have focused on unregistered displaced persons who had no support, leaving them unable to provide for their families and did not know where their next meal is coming from., We have also been making the camps safer and more secure, including by installing over 100 solar street lamps, many of which are placed along the 5 kilometre road we built.

Myanmar: Armed Clashes Escalate while Children Suffer in the Rakhine,News and Press Release,OSRSG Children and Armed Conflict,Protection and Human Rights,14 Jan 2021,"Sixth Report of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict in Myanmar, New York, 14 January 2021 – The escalation of armed clashes severely impacted the lives of children and their communities, resulting in a significant increase in grave violations, particularly in 2019. This was highlighted by the sixth report of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict in Myanmar released today., A total of 994 grave violations against children were verified across the country between September 2018 and June 2020, mostly in Rakhine State in 2019. Access restrictions for the United Nations remained a major challenge to monitor and verify grave violations., “Parties to conflict in Myanmar must abide by their obligations under international law,” stated Virginia Gamba, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict. “Measures to end and prevent grave violations against children need to be put in place and strengthened when they exist. They also need to be implemented, so I call upon all parties to make every possible effort in this regard,” she stated., With the killing and maiming of 320 children, including infants, there was a threefold increase in this violation between the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020. The causes for these casualties shifted during the period covered by the report as armed clashes intensified; the number of children affected by landmines and explosive remnants of war decreased, while more casualties were caused by artillery shelling, crossfire, and airstrikes., While recruitment of children by Government forces has significantly decreased in recent years, following progress made in the implementation of the Joint Action Plan of 2012, in the Rakhine, 555 children were verified as being used by the Tatmadaw, including for support functions such as military camp maintenance, digging trenches, and harvesting rice particularly in the Buthidaung Township in the Rakhine State. Of concern during the reporting period, children were detained for their alleged association with armed groups. “I am very concerned about the increasing number of children arrested and detained, including on terrorism charges,” stated the Special Representative. “Children allegedly associated with armed groups should be treated primarily as victims, and detention should be used as a measure of last resort and for the shortest possible time. Ensuring their rehabilitation and reintegration through specialized age- and gender-sensitive programs is crucial,” she emphasized., Rape and other forms of sexual violence, as well as abduction, are believed to be underreported, largely due to fear of stigma, access, and movement restrictions., While no incidents of denial of humanitarian access for children were verified by the United Nations in the reporting period, access remains of high concern in several regions due to insecurity, travel restrictions and poor road infrastructure., Government’s increased commitment to protecting children in armed conflict, Despite the concerning figures and trends, the Special Representative commended the Government of Myanmar for taking concrete measures to address these issues, such as the adoption of the Child Rights Law in July 2019 which criminalizes all grave violations against children, and the establishment in February 2020 of a National Complaint Mechanism to eliminate forced labor, which prohibits the recruitment and use of children., The engagement between the Government of Myanmar and the United Nations to accelerate the implementation of the Joint Action Plan to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children has resulted in the sanction of 466 military personnel, a decrease in the number of children recruited by the Tatmadaw, as well as the total release of 1,013 children in their ranks since 2012. In November 2020, the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army became the first armed group to sign an Action Plan to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children with the United Nations and dialogue is ongoing with other listed armed groups., Read the Full Report, ###, Grave Violations Against Children in Myanmar by all parties to conflict (September 2018 – June 2020), Overall number of grave violations: 994 grave violations against 974 children (845 boys, 123 girls, 6 sex unknown), Recruitment and use: 635 children (80 recruited, 555 used), Killing and maiming: 320 children (87 killed, 233 maimed), Sexual violence: 2 girls, Attacks on schools and hospitals: 20 attacks (18 schools, 1 hospital, 1 protected person), Abduction: 17 children, Denial of humanitarian access: 0 incidents, ###, For additional information, please contact:, Follow us on Twitter and Facebook:, www.twitter.com/childreninwar, www.facebook.com/childrenandarmedconflict",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-armed-clashes-escalate-while-children-suffer-rakhine
Critical Policy Advice for President-Elect Biden: Leading a Global Response on the Rohingya Crisis,Analysis,RI,"Contributions
Protection and Human Rights",14 Jan 2021,"Introduction, As President, Joe Biden has pledged to pursue a foreign policy based on moral values and cooperation, an approach that prioritizes decency and the protection of human rights. This pledge will be immediately tested by the ongoing repercussions of one of the worst mass atrocities in recent history, the genocide committed by the state of Myanmar against the Rohingya. But there is a way forward. And renewed global engagement can pave the way toward a lasting solution. An immediate first step should be to recognize the crimes against the Rohingya for what they are: crimes against humanity and genocide., Starting in August 2017, the Myanmar military unleashed a brutal assault that forced more than 700,000 Rohingya people across the border into Bangladesh in a matter of months. As documented by numerous independent reports – including by Refugees International, a UN Independent International Fact Finding Mission, and the State Department’s own report – the assault was marked by systematic killings of civilians, burning of hundreds of villages, and widespread sexual assault. Today, some 1 million Rohingya refugees remain in dire conditions in Bangladesh, while another 600,000 remain at high risk of further atrocities inside Myanmar., Despite some international pressure – including U.S. targeted sanctions on the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar military Senior General Min Aung Hlaing – and ongoing accountability efforts in international and domestic fora, Myanmar has failed to improve conditions and to address these gravest of crimes. In fact, life for Rohingya in Rakhine state has largely deteriorated, and the prospect of further atrocities has grown worse. Under these conditions, the likelihood of safe, voluntary, dignified, and sustainable returns of Rohingya to their homeland is not realistic in the near future., Myanmar continues to repudiate international norms and human rights obligations. Recent elections in Myanmar were neither free nor fair and specifically excluded Rohingya from voting or running for office. The government continues to abuse and marginalize ethnic minorities around the country. The Rohingya remain effectively stateless as the Myanmar government, through its flawed 1982 Citizenship Law, still denies them citizenship. Rohingya in Rakhine state continue to face restrictions on their freedom of movement and access to medical care and humanitarian aid. This leaves them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 as Myanmar now faces a sharp increase in cases., Yet, senior officials in Myanmar have arguably shown at least some interest in the good opinion of the international community and have responded to concerted international pressure. Just before the August 2017 assault, the Myanmar government and military indicated that they were prepared to accept the recommendations of an international commission chaired by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and focused on conditions in Rakhine state and the situation of the Rohingya. More recently, the government has engaged international experts in creating a plan for the closure of prison-like camps for internally displaced people (IDPs) as recommended by the Annan Commission. And in December 2019, Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi traveled to The Hague to defend her country against genocide charges before the International Court of Justice (ICJ)., Some of this was motivated by domestic political calculations – Suu Kyi’s visit to the Hague played well ahead of Myanmar’s elections – and other steps, like implementation of its camp closure strategy and domestic accountability efforts, are little more than window dressing. But without the international pressure that has been cobbled together—however limited that has been—even these steps would not likely have been taken, and the message of impunity would have been heard more loudly and more clearly by Myanmar’s military., Changing the policies and practices of the state of Myanmar will require a multifaceted approach, one that combines increased international pressure with ongoing diplomatic engagement. For the sake of credibility both with Myanmar and globally, the United States government must speak truthfully about what has happened and be willing to use condemnation and targeted sanctions to demonstrate that the perpetration of egregious crimes comes with serious costs. At the same time, the Biden administration should show a willingness to promote a more cooperative relationship with Myanmar in return for significant and substantial improvements in the treatment of the Rohingya, and a genuine willingness on the part of Myanmar authorities to support accountability for abuses., The U.S. effort should be led by an official of high-standing who would be responsible for promoting multilateral coordination of measures that include diplomatic engagement with the authorities in Myanmar, further targeted sanctions including on military-owned enterprises, and support for international accountability efforts. On behalf of the U.S. government, the appointee should press for a UN Security Council session on the Rohingya crisis, which should coincide with U.S. recognition that the atrocities committed against the Rohingya amount to crimes against humanity and genocide., Some analysts may argue that pursuing a policy that includes strong pressures on Myanmar will be counterproductive, harming Myanmar’s population and efforts at democracy while driving Myanmar into the hands of China. But Myanmar’s relationship with China is complex, there is wariness about Chinese influence, and the United States is seen by many in Myanmar as a counterbalance. Moreover, pressure need not be as blunt as blanket sanctions, and can be targeted at those who are responsible for abuses. More importantly, an unchanged approach risks bolstering Myanmar’s sense of impunity and enabling further abuses, not to mention denying the accountability Rohingya seek as part of their safe return., In short, a concerted multilateral effort both to engage and pressure Myanmar where needed would greatly enhance the prospects for preventing a repeat of one of the most egregious crimes in recent history and for reaching a long-term solution to the Rohingya refugee crisis.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/critical-policy-advice-president-elect-biden-leading-global-response-rohingya-crisis

IMF executive board approves a SDR 258.4 million disbursement under the Rapid Credit Facility and purchase under the Rapid Financing Instrument to Myanmar to address the COVID-19 pandemic,News and Press Release,IMF,"Health
Recovery and Reconstruction",13 Jan 2021,"PRESS RELEASE NO. 21/9, Washington, DC: The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a disbursement of SDR 86.1 million (16.67 percent of quota) under the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF), and a purchase of SDR 172.3 million (33.33 percent of quota) under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI). This will help meet the urgent balance-of-payments needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the government’s recovery measures to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability while supporting affected sectors and vulnerable groups. The IMF emergency financing will also catalyze additional support from the international community., This is the second IMF emergency financial assistance under the RFI/RCF for Myanmar since the outbreak of the pandemic: on June 26, 2020, the IMF Executive Board approved a disbursement of US$ 356.5 million (see IMF Press Release No. 20/247 ). Today’s additional financing brings the total IMF financial assistance provided to Myanmar to address COVID-19 pandemic to about US$ 700 million., While the impact of COVID-19 outbreak was less severe than expected, the second wave of the pandemic had hit Myanmar hard, inflicting large economic and social costs and straining the frail healthcare system. Economic growth is projected at 3.2 percent for FY2019/20 (starting October 1), a sharp decline from 6.8 percent in FY2018/19. For FY2020/21, growth is expected to fall to 0.5 percent. The economic fallout will be felt disproportionally by lower income groups, SMEs, and those in conflict regions. Growth is expected to rebound to 7.9 percent in FY2021/22 reflecting the gradual recovery and strong base effects. At the same time, permanent losses in medium-term output are expected, raising concerns of increased poverty., In response to the second COVID-19 wave, the government is formulating the Myanmar Economic Recovery and Reform Plan (MERRP). The plan builds on last April’s emergency relief measures under the COVID-19 Economic Relief Plan (CERP), which aimed at preserving macroeconomic stability and mitigating the impact of the pandemic on the population. The MERRP extends relief measures while adding macroeconomic and financial stability measures to guide the recovery. The IMF emergency assistance, together with additional external support and the Debt Service Suspension Initiative, would cover higher social spending needs under continued strains on revenues and mitigate the risk of excessive monetary financing., Following the Executive Board discussion of Myanmar’s request, Mr. Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:, “Myanmar’s economy is suffering from a second COVID 19 wave, resulting in extensive lockdowns, declines in tourism, and supply chain disruptions., “The authorities remain committed to protecting the most vulnerable. In this regard, last year they enacted the COVID 19 Economic Relief Plan (CERP) featuring important emergency fiscal, financial, and monetary measures. The CERP will be followed by the Myanmar Economic Resilience and Reform Plan (MERRP). Both plans prioritize increasing healthcare spending, tax relief measures, and transfers to vulnerable households. It is important that these programs are extended equitably across the country, including in conflict regions and ethnic minorities., “The accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate and the Kyat is adjusting flexibly, with limited rules-based interventions managing excessive short-term volatility. Once conditions allow, efforts should focus on enhancing the effectiveness of the monetary policy framework and further building external buffers., “Further strengthening the banking sector’s stability is key to underpin the recovery. The authorities are committed to monitoring non-performing loans (NPLs) and accelerating the preparation of contingency plans to better manage banking sector stresses, should they materialize. They intend to conduct targeted asset quality reviews of systemically important banks, followed by a comprehensive strategy for NPL resolution and bank recapitalization. Addressing remaining gaps in the AML/CFT framework is also crucial., “The Rapid Credit Facility and Rapid Financing Instrument will help address Myanmar's urgent financing needs related to the COVID 19 shock. The authorities’ progress in enhancing spending transparency is commendable and they are committed to further enhance governance, transparency, and accountability to ensure the appropriate use of this emergency financing. Moreover, they continue to leverage capacity development and technical assistance from the Fund and other development partners to further their reforms.”, More information For information on the emergency financing requests approved by the IMF Executive Board, please see a link to the IMF Lending Tracker: https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-andcovid19/Policy-Responses-to-COVID-19, For upcoming discussions on the emergency financing requests, please see a link to the calendar of the IMF Executive Board meetings: https://www.imf.org/external/NP/SEC/bc/eng/index.aspx, IMF Communications Department, MEDIA RELATIONS, PRESS OFFICER: KEIKO UTSUNOMIYA, PHONE: +1 202 623-7100 EMAIL: MEDIA@IMF.ORG, @IMFSpokesperson",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/imf-executive-board-approves-sdr-2584-million-disbursement-under-rapid-credit

Water Sanitation Hygiene",7 Jan 2021,"After two years of clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces and the Arakan Army, it is increasingly difficult to meet the basic needs of the tens of thousands of internally displaced people (IDPs) and their host communities in Myanmar’s Rakhine State., To address the IDP’s most urgent needs, People in Need (PIN), together with local partner organisations and the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund (MHF), which is managed by the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, has been providing people in camps for the displaced in central Rakhine State with protection, nutrition, shelter, integrated assistance in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), camp coordination and camp management (CCCM)., Essential items for IDPs, Despite the challenges of COVID-19, PIN has continued supporting IDPs in 11 camps for displaced people in Mrauk U and Minbya townships. Using a community-based approach, PIN’s collaboration with community volunteers has been critical for delivering humanitarian assistance., Mg Thein Tun Kyaw, a PIN beneficiary from the Ann Thar IDP camp in Minbya, says: “We have been living at the Ann Thar camp for four or five months. After heavy fighting erupted near our village, we were forced to flee our home. It was not easy for us to move with all eight of my family members. We left everything we had behind. However, we received essential items from PIN, including cooking sets, blankets, soap, toothpaste, and toothbrushes. We thank PIN and the donors for providing for our urgent needs, and we hope the support will continue in the future.”, More than 1,000 people currently live at the Ann Thar IDP camp, which is led by Ma Than Htay, who says the current situation is precarious. “The camp urgently needs more latrines and an improved water collection system,” she says. “We have received enough shelter kits but we need more food rations because I am afraid that we will run out of our food soon, due to COVID-19. The virus has affected the possibility for people in the camps to earn money, because they cannot go outside to look for jobs. PIN provided shelter, non-food items, and handwashing solutions for us, which has been very useful. They also shared health information about COVID-19 through loudspeakers, so we are all aware of how to prevent the spread of the disease.”, Latrines for IDP camps, Through its integrated, multi-sectoral approach, PIN provides lifesaving WASH assistance to displaced populations based on needs identified in the targeted communities and on feedback received from the communities themselves. Aung Naing Win, PIN’s WASH engineer, says: “Many IDP camps struggle with limited living spaces because of the stream of new arrivals. Before we start any activities, we first conduct a site assessment to identify what the displaced communities really need. Our PIN WASH team mainly focuses on access to safe water and basic sanitation facilities, such as latrines, hand washing stations, and bathing stations for women.”, Due to COVID-19 restrictions, PIN struggled with limited access to the IDP camps. The solution was to hire local contractors to do the construction work in the camps normally done by PIN, while community facilitators, trained volunteers, and other key stakeholders monitored their work from a safe distance., Aung Naing Win says that the goal is to build at least one latrine for every 50 people in the camp. “PIN engineers develop the latrine’s design so that they are safe to use, accessible for people with disabilities, gender-segregated, and pose minimal environmental risks through the inclusion of excreta disposal systems. We then carefully discuss all of the technical specifications with hired contractors. We also build water collection systems in the camps to harvest rainwater and set up water pumping systems to transport water from rivers to ponds and/or water storage tanks.”, Hygiene kits for 8,000 people, In addition to building WASH infrastructure, PIN has distributed more than 8,200 hygiene kits and hygiene refill kits to displaced households in Mrauk U and Minbya. Based on camp assessments, PIN has also distributed non-food items such as sleeping mats, mosquito nets, blankets, clothing, buckets, jerry cans, torches, cooking stoves, cooking utensils, plastic sheets, rope, and bamboo for shelter repairs., Kyaw Kyaw Nyein, Distribution Field Assistant, says: “I am so proud of being a humanitarian worker and helping people who are most in need during this hard time. Sometimes, in the rainy season, the roads are too bad to cross. Other times we hear gun shots or mines exploding. But when we receive messages of thanks from our beneficiaries, I am happy, and I am proud to have assisted.”, Since 2019, PIN has been cooperating with local civil society organisations to provide humanitarian assistance to conflict-affected populations in central Rakhine State, with financial support from the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund (MHF), which is managed by the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs., Author: Aye Pyae Sone, PIN Myanmar Communication Officer",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/water-sanitation-and-hygiene-support-displaced-people-myanmar

The study used a convenience sample of 173 farmers (76% paddy farmers and 96% winter crop farmers) from six townships, including Kyauk Taw, Minbya, Mrauk U, Pauktaw, Ponnagyun and Sittwe.

Rohingya Arrested in Myanmar Just for Traveling,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,8 Jan 2021,"Oppressed Ethnic Group Denied Right to Freedom of Movement, Manny Maung, Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, government restrictions on movement in Myanmar have been widespread, but certain people have been more affected than others. On January 6, Myanmar police detained 99 ethnic Rohingya in Yangon for traveling without documentation in the country where they were born and lived all their lives., The Rohingya – mostly women as well as children reportedly as young as 5 years old – were apparently bound for Malaysia. They sought to escape Myanmar’s longstanding oppression of the group. Rohingya are effectively denied citizenship under the 1982 Citizenship Law so the government considers them “illegal” aliens, refusing to issue legal documentation that would allow them to travel within the country., All 99 Rohingya are now being held in government quarantine on the outskirts of Yangon, after which they will likely be transferred to immigration detention to await criminal charges., In Myanmar’s western Rakhine State, an estimated 600,000 Rohingya are confined to camps and villages without freedom of movement, cut off from access to adequate food, health care, education, and livelihoods. In 2017, a campaign of ethnic cleansing by Myanmar’s security forces against the Rohingya involved crimes against humanity and acts of genocide., Rohingya frequently face arrest and prosecution for attempting to travel between townships or outside of Rakhine State. On December 24, authorities arrested 13 Rohingya in the Bago Region after they left Maungdaw township. That group is being detained in a government quarantine facility in Pyay town, and after they are released it is expected they too will be transferred to an immigration police cell to await charges., International human rights law guarantees the right to freedom of movement for everyone to travel within the country and to leave the country. The right to freedom of movement does not depend on nationality, and statelessness cannot be invoked as a justification for the denial of free movement., Both groups of Rohingya should be released, allowed to self-isolate until their quarantine is over and they test negative, and permitted to travel freely, subject to Covid-19 restrictions applicable to everyone in Myanmar. Criminal charges should not be brought against them for simply being Rohingya and trying to move from one place to another. The government should lift all travel restrictions on Rohingya and repeal discriminatory regulations that limit their right to freedom of movement. The government should amend the 1982 Citizenship Law in line with international standards.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/rohingya-arrested-myanmar-just-traveling
How the pandemic gave rise to an unlikely dream for an internally displaced woman in Kachin State in Myanmar,News and Press Release,UN Women,"Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction",5 Jan 2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, Htoi Gender and Development Foundation is working with women in camps for internally displaced people in Kachin State and supporting the economic empowerment of the most vulnerable women., This work has been made possible by supplementary funding from the Government of Japan for the regional programme ‘Women and Girls at the Centre of COVID-19 Prevention’. The programme contributes to the goal of leaving no one behind, even during COVID-19., The pandemic is just another unwelcomed burden for Daw Lu San – a widow – and if the situation lasts too long, she fears that the financial burdens will become too much to bear on her own. Single or married, she says women in general have it harder in the camps for displaced people., Daw Lu San lives in the Zi Lun camp in Kachin, participates in the Htoi Gender cash for work programme where she was trained to make cloth masks. Following the training, she received 500,000 kyat ($380) to invest in her business, and she began to produce and sell the masks for 400 kyat ($0.31) each., As the sole breadwinner, Daw Lu San looks after the needs of her four children, all of whom are still young and in school. She spoke fondly of their ambitions but financially, she is unsure whether she will be able to pay for their dreams, including university, medical school or music lessons. “All my children are clever and they have goals,” she says. “But I can’t support them financially. I want to support whatever they want to do but I do not have the ability to support them.”, As schools are currently closed due to COVID-19, the family is staying in the camp. While social distancing has been advised, there is rarely any space for that within the camp or even in their own home, says Daw Lu San., An aspiration to succeed, Before the pandemic, Daw Lu San worked in a pig husbandry and also sewed bags and sold them in the local markets. She had participated in a Htoi Gender training programme where she learned sewing, which made it easier for her to begin producing cloth masks., “I am currently making three-layered masks and I sell them to the Kachin State Women’s Network and other organizations that place orders with our sewing group in the camp. All the masks are order-based, so if I make more masks, then I can have more profit”, said Daw Lu San., Her post-pandemic plans are ambitious but she is determined to invest in the future, and her small-scale mask production initiative has given birth to something bolder. With her newly acquired skills of making cloth masks, Daw Lu San wants to expand her business into stores and markets in the nearby Hpa-kant, Bhamo and Laiza townships in Kachin State, where she has previously sold her bags. Once she begins to earn enough, she plans to save and invest in the future of her family and her personal desire to establish a small-scale animal husbandry, complete with pigs and chickens., “Men and women can do the same things equally. I have my sewing skills, I send all my children to school and I lead my family of four children just as well as any male-headed household. I want to be a successful business woman, and farm on my own land.”, In the meantime, however, she can see the impact of COVID-19 around her in the camp. People began to borrow money from each other to buy food without any means of income, and they are unable to return the money. This harsh cycle was to be expected and Daw Lu San admits that if this lasts longer, it will make life very difficult for the camp dwellers. She is grateful to participate in the Htoi Gender programme.
It has not only provided access to financial support for a sustainable business model but also given her a support system., The Htoi Gender programme primarily includes the most vulnerable women in the camps: widows, women with disabilities and those without any form of employment. Ever since her husband passed away,
Daw Lu San has been alone in supporting her family and through the women’s sewing group she met other women who are facing their own challenges head on just as she is. This connected the women with one another and enabled them to support those who are in more need than themselves by offering food and even financial support., Adapting to new challenges, Over the years, Nang Pu, the Director of Htoi Gender and Development Foundation, built a close relationship with the women in the camps. Those relationships continue despite the pandemic: “Some women contact me through Facebook messenger to ask for help related to gender-based violence and women’s rights violations,” Nang Pu says, “Before the pandemic, women would usually come to my office to discuss such matters.”, With careful planning and mapping of a safe route away from restricted areas, Htoi Gender was able to ensure that medical services continued to reach the camps during the lockdown without any setbacks. The mandatory two-week quarantine measure was a huge hurdle. They had to rethink how to reach women but also not to put them or the staff in harm’s way. “In order to avoid the two-week quarantine measures for the staff, the cars are driven to a certain point where another car from the camp side would be awaiting to unload the items. The medical items are then distributed by the camp leaders,” explained Nang Pu. This way, they prevented any human contact or possible transmissions., Nang Pu is well-known as a gender and children’s rights advocate in Kachin State. She began her charity work in her local church. She observed high cases of infant and maternal mortality and gender-based discrimination in Kachin State, and she felt dissatisfied with the inadequate responses to those challenges, so she established Htoi Gender, a local communitybased organization in 2014. Six years later, and in a time of global pandemic, the organization continues to help the most vulnerable in the camps of internally displaced people., A lifeline for the most vulnerable, For Htoi Gender and Development Foundation, sustaining the livelihoods of the women in camps of internally displaced people during the pandemic has been crucial. Many of the women participating in their programmes have care responsibilities and need income to take care of their children, family members with disabilities or a child on the way. “The women are affected much more as they are taking the responsibility of their families. This results to heavier work load and more stress,” added Nang Pu., Under the cash for work programme, supported by supplementary funding from Japan, Htoi Gender has engaged 200 women from 12 camps in income generation activities and the women have received training for activities such as making cloth masks, hand sanitizers and food items like balarchaung kyaw. All these initiatives enable women to make an income during the COVID-19 crisis. By providing the right support to women like Daw Lu San, Nang Pu believes that they can take charge of their lives, gain economic empowerment and discover the strength they have within themselves., Daw Lu San agrees. She finds that the programme has served as a lifeline especially for women with disabilities and widows who have very few options in finding sources of income. “Some of the women cried when they sold their masks as this was the first time they earned money during COVID-19. Last night, I also wondered to myself what situation my family and I would be in if I wasn’t involved in this programme”.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/how-pandemic-gave-rise-unlikely-dream-internally-displaced-woman-kachin-state-myanmar

Health
Protection and Human Rights",5 Jan 2021,"Hiroyuki Takeshima, Phoo Pye Zone, and Ian Masias, Mechanization service providers (MSP) in Myanmar were originally surveyed by telephone over three rounds in May, June, and July 2020 to determine how their businesses were being affected by COVID-19 related restrictions. Most of the MSPs interviewed were engaged in providing farmers with tractor-related services. The results of those surveys were published in Myanmar Strategy Support Program Policy Notes 07, 12, and 17, respectively. To trace the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their economic activities, a fourth round of the survey of MSPs was done in early-November 2020, administered mostly to those engaged in harvesting activities. This note reports on the results of the fourth survey, as well as some trends seen between the earlier survey rounds and this last one., Key findings, • Combine harvester and tractor service providers engaged in the harvesting and the transport of harvests continue to face restrictions, particularly in the movement of their machines. However, MSPs generally managed to provide timely services to farmers for harvesting and charged similar hiring rates as in 2019., • MSPs perceive movement restrictions to be increasingly common. They principally attributing these restrictions to COVID-related regulations., • Financial challenges continue to affect farmers, many of whom approach MSPs for informal financial support., • The expectations of MSPs on their business prospects continue to remain dire, although there have been some improvements since earlier survey rounds.
Recommended actions • Support measures that allow for the sufficient movement of MSPs while containing COVID-19 spread. Continue granting MSPs exemptions to COVID-19 related controls that limit MSPs’ abilities to provide farmers with the services they require., • Adjust loan repayment terms for machines and other equipment owned by MSPs.
Consider offering temporary loans, waivers, or reductions of MSP business expenses., • For tractor service providers, facilitate greater non-farm use of their tractors, as this will mitigate some of the revenue losses that they are experiencing in the farming sector.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/monitoring-impact-covid-19-myanmar-agricultural-production-and-rural-livelihoods-0

ASEAN’s Rakhine Crisis: Assessing the regional response to atrocities in Myanmar’s Rakhine State,Analysis,APHR,Protection and Human Rights,3 Jan 2021,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, “The purposes of ASEAN are to ensure that the peoples of ASEAN live in peace… in a just, democratic, and harmonious environment.”
ASEAN Charter, Article 1(4)., “ASEAN has a responsibility to protect people in the region. They have a responsibility to protect Rohingya no matter where they are. Collectively ASEAN can be and should be stronger.”
Wai Wai Nu, Founder and Director of the Women’s Peace Network, Rohingya activist., On 25 August 2017, Myanmar’s security forces launched a devastating attack on the Rohingya community living in Rakhine State, in the western part of Myanmar. In the weeks that followed, thousands were killed, women and girls were raped, hundreds of homes and entire villages burned to the ground, and more than 740,000 women, men and children forced to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. The attacks took place against a background of decades-long discrimination, persecution, and violence against the Rohingya, a situation that continues today., This report examines the Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ (ASEAN) response to this crisis, from the initial outbreak of violence in August 2017 to the present day. It is based on 45 interviews with Rohingya representatives, NGO workers, diplomats, ASEAN Parliamentarians, political analysts, and current and former ASEAN officials. It also draws on extensive review of official statements and other documents, as well as NGO and media reports., The findings show how, caught between respect for its key principles of consensus and non-interference on the one hand, and international and domestic outcry on the other, the regional bloc has struggled to respond to the crisis and articulate a clear vision and strategy that would help end the cycle of violence and displacement. The report examines some of the reasons behind ASEAN’s so far weak response. These include a lack of leadership both within the Secretariat and among Member States, giving space for the Myanmar government to set the parameters of ASEAN’s engagement. ASEAN’s reluctance to acknowledge the underlying human rights dimensions of the crisis has also meant that the bloc has focused only on the “less controversial” issues, risking being at best counter-productive and at worst actively contributing to human rights abuses. ASEAN’s lack of transparency, reluctance to engage with actors other than the Myanmar government, and the weaknesses inherent in its own institutions have further undermined its response.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/asean-s-rakhine-crisis-assessing-regional-response-atrocities-myanmar-s-rakhine-state
