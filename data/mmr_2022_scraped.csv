Response figures are based on self-reporting by organizations to clusters. The next humanitarian update will be issued at the end of January 2023., HIGHLIGHTS & KEY MESSAGES, • Almost two years since the 2021 military takeover, the people of Myanmar continue to suffer amid hostilities and a crippling economic crisis that is being compounded by inflation., • More than 1.5 million people remain displaced across the country due to insecurity and violence. This is more than double the number a year ago with displaced people now living in undignified conditions and in desperate need in hardto-reach locations., • Conflict, contamination with landmines and explosive hazards, tight security, access restrictions, and threats against aid workers, particularly in the Northwest and Southeast, are on the rise, endangering lives and hampering humanitarian operations., • The informal ceasefire between the Arakan Army (AA) and the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) in Rakhine and southern Chin continues to hold but remains very fragile., • Humanitarian and protection needs are mounting, forcing people to adopt negative coping mechanisms to survive.
Women and girls are disproportionately being disproportionately affected., • The humanitarian community is deeply concerned about the impact of new administrative rules around NGO registration which will further shrink operating space., • Humanitarians continue to address the emerging needs of affected and displaced people where access is possible, reaching almost four million people in need with critical lifesaving assistance in the year to September., • As 2022 draws to a close, the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remains drastically underfunded with only 35 per cent, leaving a gap of US$536 million (FTS). A dramatic increase in funding and an expansion of access will be critical for the humanitarian community to reach the 4.5 million people prioritized for life-saving assistance in 2023., KEY FIGURES*, 1.5M People internally displaced across Myanmar, 1.1M People currently displaced by clashes and insecurity since February 2021, 330K People internally displaced due to conflict prior to February 2021, mainly in Rakhine, Kachin, Chin, and Shan, 34K Civilian properties estimated burnt or destroyed since February 2021., *Displacement figures fluctuate during any given month. These figures represent the number of people currently displaced. Cumulative numbers for returns and displacement are not always available., SITUATION OVERVIEW, As 2022 draws to an end, humanitarian needs and protection concerns continue to grow across Myanmar, exposing many men, women, boys and girls to constant risks that threaten their physical safety and mental well-being. Almost two years after the military takeover, armed clashes, including the use of heavy weaponry, between the MAF and various Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs) and People’s Defence Forces (PDFs) in multiple states and regions are now a regular feature of daily life. Internal displacement and destruction of civilian properties have continued unabated, depriving more than 1.5 million people of safe shelter and dignified living conditions., The economic situation remains fragile and has been further undermined by inflation that has dramatically driven up the cost of basic food items and fuel. According to the Food Security Cluster, 15.2 million people are severely and moderately food insecure heading into 2023, up from 13.2 million people at the same time last year. To survive this multi-dimensional crisis, affected and displaced people have resorted negative coping mechanisms, including lowering food intake, selling their assets, dropping out of school, engaging in risky migration and marrying their children off early., Despite the dire humanitarian situation, access to humanitarian assistance continues to be undermined by the imposition of various administrative and physical constraints on the movement of people and goods. The humanitarian community is deeply concerned about new administrative requirements outlined on 28 October 2022 which establish a mandatory registration system for international and national non-government organizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations (CSOs). These new rules have the serious potential to reduce timely and effective delivery of humanitarian assistance to people in need in Myanmar and would severely impede the work of NGOs and CSOs who are the backbone of the humanitarian operation., With rising needs, ensuring programme continuity and engagement of the NGO and CSO community is critical to ensuring no one is left behind as we move into 2023. The humanitarian community remains committed to staying and delivering for the people of Myanmar, but as they stand, the new requirements are likely to mean that many people in need will miss out on the support they require to survive in 2023. Given the consequences for millions of people in need, and the reality that the implementation infrastructure is not yet fully in place to facilitate the administrative steps outlined, the humanitarian community is proposing a six-month moratorium on any implementation of these new rules., Such a pause would allow an opportunity for discussions at national and sub-national level and would allow space to discuss how to ensure that vital support to people in need is not interrupted., Heading into 2023, conflict dynamics are expected to remain at the same level or worsen, especially in the Northwest and Southeast. It is estimated that 17.6 million people will be in need next year of whom 4.5 million have been prioritized for urgent assistance.2 Humanitarians are committed to meeting humanitarian needs of the population, providing food, shelter, health, water and sanitation, education and protection services to crisis-affected and displaced people across the country. However, both a lack of sustained access and of funding remain key obstacles. As of 28 December, the 2022 HRP is only 35 per cent funded, which amounts to only $290 million out of a total of $826 million required, leaving significant unmet needs which will flow on into 2023.3 A repeat of this level of funding in 2023 would have dire consequences and donors are urged to give generously in support of people affected by crisis in Myanmar next year.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-update-no-25-30-december-2022

The Myanmar Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) estimates that, in 2022, 14.4 million people, including 5 million children, have needed assistance. Up to December 2022, UNICEF has received generous contributions from the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/BHA), the European Commission’s Humanitarian Office, the German Federal Foreign Office, the Global Thematic Fund, Denmark, Japan, Norway, the Korean Committee for UNICEF, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) and the World Health Organization (WHO). The funds received contribute to delivering much needed assistance through UNICEF programmes covering Nutrition, Health, HIV/AIDS, Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Education, Child protection, Gender-based violence in emergencies, Prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA), Social protection and cash-based programming, Accountability to affected populations (AAP), and Humanitarian leadership and Cluster coordination. UNICEF Myanmar has so far received US$30.32 million, representing 20 per cent of the amount appealed for. In 2023, UNICEF will continue responding according to its Humanitarian Action for Children appeal. The programmes hope to scale up services to the targeted populations, especially children in need, with continued support from the donors. UNICEF expresses its sincere appreciation to all private and public sector donors for their contributions to supporting the children of Myanmar., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, Displacement due to conflict rose again in December, reaching a total of 1,505,7001 people. This figure includes those displaced by conflict prior to 2021. The ongoing conflict is constraining the movement of assistance, supplies and people. In Rakhine, the ceasefire between the Myanmar Armed Forces and the Arakan Army has resulted in the easing of some transportation restrictions. Nevertheless access, as elsewhere in the country, remains severely constrained. Heightened security measures, checkpoints and denial of travel authorizations are compounding humanitarian workers’ inability to reach children and their families, who are increasingly vulnerable to protection issues, malnutrition and disease. According to UNOCHA’s latest figures2 , approximately 20,800 people have been affected by the resurgence of conflict in the region since August 2022 and remain displaced in Rakhine State and Paletwa township in Chin., In the northwest, comprising Chin, Sagaing and Magway, 795,6001 displaced children, woman and men are located in these regions, representing 68 per cent of all people displaced nationally since February 2021. Severe access constraints continue to hinder timely and principled deliveries of aid. In the southeast, armed clashes are forcing people to search for safety in nearby forests or host communities and informal displacement sites. Humanitarian organizations face challenges in providing life-saving services for the numerous displaced people in remote rural areas due to security concerns and restricted access to urban zones. Despite this, UNICEF is coordinating with local partners to provide necessary assistance for the displaced population, notably with health, nutrition, WASH, child protection and education services., Throughout the country, landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) continue to pose a threat to the life of children and their communities. Based on UNICEF’s most recent monitoring report of landmines and ERW3 , the number of casualties nationwide from January to October 2022 has already exceeded the total number of cases for 2021 (117 per cent). Some 333 people have so far been impacted with 86 people killed and 247 injured. Children account for 32 per cent of cases. Giving the ongoing reporting constraints, the actual numbers are anticipated to be much higher. UNICEF is working with partners to provide explosive ordnance risk education (EORE) to prevent such incidents and to protect children and communities against the physical injury and psychological trauma caused by landmines and ERW.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-myanmar-humanitarian-situation-report-no-11-december-2022
Inclusive quality education is key for learning opportunities,News and Press Release,PIN,Education,16 Dec 2022,"Amid ongoing conflicts, we are working in the Education in Emergencies (EiE) sector; together with support from local organisations, we ensure access to safe and quality education for conflict-affected children in Kachin State, Myanmar. Addressing the urgent educational needs, we support local educational actors’ capacity to provide continuous quality education and increase access to protective, quality and inclusive learning opportunities to promote the health and well-being of school-aged conflict-affected children., To deliver qualitative inclusive education in an emergency, our local partner organisations and we have provided relevant training on technical knowledge and skills to local education actors to encourage more robust locally-led educational support. Teachers are still in high demand for schools in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps. Along with local partner organisations, we first conducted the education volunteer programme with camp-based volunteers to become school volunteer teachers. About 38 trained volunteer teachers work in 11 targeted IDP camps in three townships of the Bhamo district in Kachin State., Empowering local education actors’ roles, Through our support, teachers and volunteer teachers can strengthen their role and promote the children's well-being in the EiE context. Moreover, with our partners, we conducted training with Teaching in Crisis Contexts (TiCC) and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) curricula, together with providing incentives for essential livelihood support and the ability to support children’s learning continuously., Supporting psychosocial well-being of conflict-affected children, “We are focusing on children’s mental well-being and happy and healthy brain development,” says Hkawng Sang* (name changed), a community volunteer teacher. She adds, “In conflict situations, children are the most vulnerable because most parents struggle for regular livelihoods and cannot be attentive to each child as they would like. As a mother, I know how much psychosocial support is needed for the displaced camps. Before the SEL and TiCC training, I was shy and silent in public, even though I could not speak out if I needed something. After receiving the training, I am actively ready to support the children.”, Hkaun Bu*, a volunteer teacher, shares her experiences teaching an SEL curriculum to children in the camp. “Children are asking for more time to learn the SEL modules. Mostly, children are happy to sing the songs, dance and play during the SEL training. We focus on kindergarten (KG) to Grade 8 school-aged children. The SEL curriculum lasts about 38 weeks, so we conduct SEL training three times per week.”, She continues, “I have noticed children developing kind behaviour, helping each other in the class, helpful towards the parent, and happy to work together as a group. When SEL training starts, we play a game called parachute, and every child wants to hold the parachute; we let children throw their emotions into the parachute and imagine throwing it away. When they play this game, they are all happy and safe. Some were shy before we started the modules, but one or two weeks later, all were happy and excited to learn the next modules.”, Jar Seng*, 10, feels happy and safe when she learns about SEL curricula. She says, “I love to play games and sing songs with dancing. I want to be a singer, so I love singing and dancing. Also, I like painting and drawing as well. Previously, I did not want to pay attention to what my mother told me and I had a difficult relationship with my friends. But I learn through SEL training, and I am more polite in listening and have good relationships with my friends and help with housework.”, Jar Seng is ready to sing and dance when volunteer teachers gather children in front of the classroom. They sing a Kachin song together with modern dance. A three-year-old kindergarten girl also wants to dance in the group. Her mother looks at her carefully and expresses her gratitude to the teachers. “We are living nearby camp school. My daughter hears the songs of children and wants to come here. But she is too small to participate in the group. That is why I come along with her. Teachers let her play games and paint.”, Providing educational needs for children, With financial support from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic (MFA), we provide home-based learning materials and student kits distributions to nearly 1,700 children between kindergarten (KG) to Grade 8 and support learning materials for 11 school libraries in primary and post-primary schools. Seng Jar Awng*, 12, who likes reading books, is happy to go to the new school library. “Now our school library is stocked with story books. I love reading. I read all home-based learning books distributed by the teachers.”, Daw Bawk Ra*, a camp school mistress, says, “Now we have a camp library kit and library place which consisting of books for children, a tablet with e-books, audiobooks and educational apps. Moreover, our school infrastructure is needed to be supported because our school is located at the top of a hill. We need a water tank at the school to ensure we get clean and safe drinking water for the children. Many of our children bring water from their homes with water bottles which PIN has provided. However, we have a safe space for children to play the games freely. Thanks to People in Need and its donors for supporting our school.”, Along with educational support, PIN and our partners provide parents with skills workshops in all 11 camps. A total of 426 caregivers joined these workshops. Kha Mai, a local partner organisation project lead, says how important the learning environment and parent skills workshop are. “Parent Skills workshops aim to improve the parents’ stress management skills and positive parenting practices. All of these skills and practices support child and adolescent psychosocial well-being. To have a healthy, mutually enjoyable relationship between children and parents is our goal to foster optimal child growth and development.”, She adds, “If we provide this knowledge to parents and caregivers, it will decrease the violence against children at home and improve caregivers’ positive developmental outcomes. And also, increased parental engagement in children’s learning and development can reduce the risk of school drop-out issues.”, *The names of certain individuals and locations have been changed for their protection."", Author: Aye Pyae Sone, Communication officer for Myanmar",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/inclusive-quality-education-key-learning-opportunities

Water Sanitation Hygiene",28 Dec 2022,"IOM Vision, IOM, in coordination with humanitarian and development partners, seeks to support the people of Myanmar through the provision of essential and life-saving multi-sectoral assistance to crisis-affected populations, while building local capacities for response and recovery. Recognizing the complex mobility dynamics and cross-border implications of the crisis, IOM aims to provide data and analysis on mobility and needs to the wider humanitarian community and will continue to coordinate to ensure that preparedness actions and targeted response capacities are in place and strengthened., Context analysis, Almost two years since the military takeover in February 2021, the economic, political, and social crisis in Myanmar has become more complex, with no signs of resolution. Myanmar faces acute humanitarian needs, public infrastructure and services have deteriorated with the departure of personnel who have joined the civil disobedience movement (CDM), and as the country faces the consequence of global crises - including but not limited to rising inflation and prices for basic commodities., Conflict-related displacement continues unabated, with 1.1 million people having been forced to flee their homes since February 2021, out of 1.4 million total displaced in the country. The highest rates of displacement are in the North-West, where 770,400 people remain displaced since February 2021, of which 612,400 are in Sagaing region alone (OCHA, 2022). Active conflict and clashes also continue in the South-East where just under 300,000 people remain displaced. In these locations, families experience repeated, short-term displacement, moving to avoid armed actors, often in hard-to-reach forest areas. There are frequent reports of arson attacks against villages, leading to widespread destruction of homes, public buildings and personal as well as livelihood assets., Protection risks are grave, with increasing incidents of injuries due to explosive remnants of war, regular reports of arbitrary arrests and detention, as well as greater risks of domestic, gender-based violence and exploitation and abuse against the backdrop of increasing lawlessness and limited means for accessing formal justice systems. In Rakhine, clashes have recently intensified, resulting in 20,000 newly displaced as of September 2022. Security measures have also been imposed, limiting the movement of people and goods. Humanitarian access is a challenge due to several factors - including operational impediments imposed by authorities, hard-to-reach rural, mountainous, or jungle areas people are displaced to, as well as conflict-related insecurity leading to roadblocks, checkpoints and travel restrictions., The economic downturn due to COVID-19 and the political turmoil has resulted in increasingly complex and mixed population movements, both internally and internationally, including regular and irregular cross-border movements between Myanmar and neighbouring countries in both directions. Amongst these overall flows, the proportion of migrants migrating from or returning to conflict-affected contexts (including to/from a situation of existing displacement) has increased. Disrupted livelihoods, deteriorating economic and security conditions, and increasing mobility have also increased protection risks and vulnerabilities, as people resort to unsafe and high-risk migration strategies, posing greater risk of trafficking, exploitation or abusive recruitment practices, including from displacement sites such as camps. As of October 2022, IOM estimates that approximately 40,000 Myanmar nationals are leaving the country monthly for conflict-related but also economic and other reasons, through a range of regular and irregular pathways, with the majority migrating to Thailand., In 2023 displacement is expected at a similar or higher rate as a result of the ongoing or worsening conflict. Humanitarian space is also expected to worsen, with increased scrutiny on humanitarian organizations. Public health and education services will likely continue to be disrupted, including services related to COVID-19, with protection risks increasing. The Financial Action Taskforce's ""call for action"" blacklisting of Myanmar in October 2022 will likely further disrupt banking services and impact the financial flows into the country. Planned elections in 2023 could result in additional widespread insecurity and subsequent clampdown by the Myanmar Armed Forces, while de facto authorities are expected to push for camp closures and forced returns., With high vulnerability and low readiness, Myanmar is ranked as one of the world's most at-risk countries for climate change. The country ranks 156 out of 182 countries on the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative Index on climate vulnerability. Myanmar continues to be at risk for disasters due to natural hazards, such as tropical storms, cyclones, and earthquakes. The country is also vulnerable to sea level rise and as the majority of the population relies on agricultural livelihoods which are climate-sensitive, additional action is urgently required on adaptation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-crisis-response-plan-2023

Water Sanitation Hygiene",23 Dec 2022,"KHRG # 22-1-NB1, Introduction, Following the February 2021 coup, villagers in Doo Tha Htoo (Thaton) District have faced a significant increase in the number of human rights violations committed against them due to the escalation of military activity and fighting between the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO)[1] and the combined forces of the State Administration Council (SAC)[2], [3] and Border Guard Force (BGF)[4]. Local villagers have not only been impacted by that activity, but have also been the target of many attacks. This news bulletin outlines a number of human rights violations that were committed in Doo Tha Htoo District between April 22nd and May 22nd 2022, following a statement that was released by the KNDO on April 20th 2022, urging SAC troops to withdraw from Lay Kay and Ta Paw army camps. Because of the failure to withdraw, fighting between the KNDO and joint forces of the SAC and BGF broke out in the area., During the reporting period, local villagers have faced displacement, looting, property damage, forced return, and other threats by the SAC and BGF. Villagers have also been used as forced porters, navigators and human shields. On May 1st, Doo Tha Htoo District suffered from its first air strikes since the coup. Launched by SAC aircraft, these air strikes resulted in 59 houses being damaged and 10 houses being burned to the ground. Thousands of villagers have had to displace and have experienced a lack of essential supplies and humanitarian aid while at these displacement sites., While the district saw a lapse in conflict and conflict-related human rights violations following the signing of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA)[5] in 2015, the current military junta has reinvigorated its ‘four cuts’ strategy[6]. The ‘four cuts’ strategy was first implemented in the mid-1970s in Karen State and led to widespread and systematic violence against villagers in Doo Tha Htoo District for several decades. Since the 2021 coup, villagers and their property have become the target of SAC attacks, making it impossible to remain in their villages amidst the damage and destruction. The incidents that are covered in this news bulletin show that grave crimes are being committed by the SAC and BGF, in breach of international humanitarian and human rights laws and norms, and that may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity., A. SAC and BGF refusal to withdraw, On April 20th 2022, concerned about the security of villagers, the KNDO in Bilin Township, Doo Tha Htoo District released a statement to try to get the SAC and BGF to leave local areas under Karen National Union (KNU)[7] control. The statement provided two options for the SAC and BGF from Lay Kay and Ta Paw army camps. The first option was for BGF troops to reunify with the KNDO and for the SAC to withdraw from the army camps before April 23rd 2022. The second option was for the SAC and BGF to leave their army camps and KNU territory altogether.[8] Based on reports from villagers, local KNDO authorities assumed that the BGF troops would reunify with the KNDO because, after the statement was released, the BGF leaders at Lay Kay army camp told the KNDO to give them two days (until April 22nd) to make a decision. The SAC and BGF however did not withdraw from their camps, nor did the BGF reunify with the KNDO. Therefore, fighting broke out on April 24th 2022 in Lay Kay village and the surrounding areas and continued throughout the reporting period. Furthermore, the SAC and BGF sent more soldiers from Dwe Lo Township, Mu Traw District to their army camps in Bilin Township. The reinforcements arrived on May 8th or 9th, which also led to increased and prolonged fighting., B. Fighting and attacks on civilians, i. Shelling and unexploded ordnance (UXO), During the fighting that began on April 24th 2022 in Lay Kay village, Lay Kay village tract, Bilin Township, an unknown SAC army camp in Kamarmaung [K’Ma Moh] Town shelled about three to five 120 mm mortars into the area around Lay Kay village each day through at least May 7th , as reported by villagers. [Shelling has continued since then, but less regularly.] As a result, large acres of villagers’ rubber plantations were burned by the shelling. As one IDP, Naw W--- said, “Many mortars landed near Lay Kay village, such as beside Lay Kay Rocky Mountain. No villagers were injured, but many rubber plantations along the hill [beside the village] were burned. Nobody dared to kill [put out] the fire so it likely destroyed many plantations.”, On May 7th 2022, fighting broke out after SAC troops and BGF Company #2 under Battalion #1014 encountered KNDO soldiers from Battalion #2 near a monastery in Ler Hklaw village, Weh Pya Raw village tract, Bilin Township. The incident happened when the SAC and BGF troops were heading to Lay Kay army camp to reinforce troops. During the incident, the SAC and BGF conducted indiscriminate shelling, firing about 50 mortars in the vicinity of Ler Hklaw village. As a result, monastery buildings, one house, one tractor, and about five cars and five motorcycles were damaged. The shrapnel from the shelling also killed one goat and one bull that were owned by a villager. One unexploded mortar shell was found in the monastery compound in the village. Villagers asked the BGF and SAC soldiers who shelled the mortars to remove the unexploded mortar, but they refused. Villagers suspect that there are more unexploded ordnance (UXO) on their farms, so they remain afraid while farming., ii. Air strikes, On May 1st 2022, the SAC air force conducted air strikes twice into Lay Kay village. The first time, at about 10 am, two helicopters dropped an unknown number of bombs into the village. A second air strike took place in the village in the afternoon with two military jets dropping an unknown number of bombs into the village. According to the testimony of Naw G---, a villager from P’Ya Raw village tract, Bilin Township, “During the air strike, we were [taking refuge] in a rubber plantation. We had to flee very quickly from the air strike and with difficulty [as we tried to stay out of sight] and we worried that a bomb would land on us. The aircraft [helicopters and jets] were flying right over us. We had to move to another place, further [from the incident location]. It was raining that night; we had no bed to sleep in and we had to sleep in the rain. We were fleeing with children, so we were facing great difficulties. Those [who had to flee] included three babies. […] [W]e had to sleep on the ground [without enough shelter].”, Due to the air strikes, 59 houses were damaged and 10 houses, along with all of the villagers’ possessions, were burned to the ground. Livestock were also killed. One of the villagers, Naw G---, whose [two] houses were destroyed by the air strikes, said: “I feel sad talking about it [the feeling of losing my house]. […] [A]fter the air strike, at about 3 pm, we received information that our house had burned down, so we returned to our village to kill [put out] the fire. But everything was gone [burned by the fire,] when we arrived home. Nothing was left. […] We had a lot of products in our shop [that were lost]. One sister stored a large amount of wood to build houses that was also gone. […] [A]t first we thought we might be able to save anything we could from the fire, but we could not make it in time. Everything was gone when we arrived. […] [M]any houses were also damaged. […] [M]y chickens and three kittens might have also been [caught in the fire and killed].”, A local villager, Saw Y--- from P’Yah Raw village tract, Bilin Township went to Lay Kay village the day after the incident. He described what was left of Lay Kay village, stating that “the village was so quiet, it was just like a cemetery. A lot of villagers’ pets and animals such as dogs especially puppies, pigs and chickens followed me. I guess that they were begging for food [because they were hungry]. When I arrived [to where the air strike happened], Tharamu’s [Naw G---‘s] house was still burning. I am not sure how big their store of wood [for building houses] was. Even when I arrived there the next day, after it had been raining the whole night, the fire was still burning the store of wood. Many houses were burnt to ashes.”, Since the February 2021 coup, SAC helicopters and jets have conducted reconnaissance missions many times in the area. However, these are the first air strikes in Doo Tha Htoo District since the 2021 coup. Since December 2021, the SAC has increased the number of air strikes across Southeast Burma, which has led to a significant deterioration of the human rights situation and villagers’ livelihoods.[9] The SAC’s air and ground attacks are targeting civilian areas, causing the destruction of villagers’ property and livelihoods. Aerial operations must comply with the principles of humanitarian law and respect the principle of distinction by avoiding civilian targets and limiting harm to civilians even when attacking military targets. By continuously targeting civilian areas and private property in their air attacks, the SAC is breaching numerous international treaty and customary laws including the Geneva Convention. When speaking about the air strikes on May 1st, a villager Naw G--- stated: “They [the SAC] should not bomb villagers’ houses. Their acts are too brutal. We did not expect them [the SAC] to act that brutally toward villagers, but we could not predict it [what the SAC would do to us].”, C. Displacement, Beginning on April 20th 2022, prior to the deadline announced in the KNDO statement, villagers from three village tracts around Lay Kay and Ta Paw army camps fled their homes, anticipating the renewal of armed conflict. Some villagers had seen the statement on social media and spread the message that fighting could happen if the SAC and BGF did not accept the KNDO’s request. It is also likely that the KNU informed villagers that fighting might break out, in order to protect villagers given the uncertainty of the situation. Villagers from areas including Lay Kay, P’Ya Raw, Thoo K’Bee and Ler Hklaw villages in P’Ya Raw village tract; Ta Paw and Ta Paw Hkee villages in Ta Paw village tract; and Khaw Hpoe Pleh village in Khaw Hpoe Pleh village tract displaced to other areas. Some villagers fled to other villages, some fled to nearby towns and some fled to the forest and caves. It is estimated that about 3,000 IDPs from 528 Lay Kay households fled to different places for refuge. [No information regarding the number of displaced villagers from other villages was available.], Believing that the fighting would not last long, villagers brought enough supplies to their hiding places for just a few days. However, villagers were not able to return immediately to their villages. The supplies they initially brought, which included clothing, blankets, food, household materials and some materials for shelter such as tarpaulin, were not enough for the longer period of time in which villagers were displaced. According to one of the IDPs, Naw G--- from P’Ya Raw village tract, Bilin Township, who fled on April 20th, “We do not feel secure returning to the village to get more rice anymore. At first, we thought that it [the fighting] might happen for only two or three days, so we brought food for only two to three days. We have been displaced since [April] 20th, it has been over 10 days already, so we ran out of food. We hope it [the conflict] will finish and it will be cleared [Lay Kay army camp will be destroyed] soon.”, On May 7th 2022, fighting also broke out in Ler Hklaw village between the KNDO and the combined SAC and BGF troops who were marching from Tha Gaw Play army camp in Dwe Lo Township, Mu Traw District to the Lay Kay army camp in Doo Tha Htoo District. Most of the Ler Hklaw villagers fled to the forest. Some villagers did remain in the village, but have been living in fear., IDPs are at high risk of increased health issues as a result of displacement, and face a significant risk of contracting malaria and other diseases during displacement. Those IDPs who test positive for malaria often have no access to medicine to treat it. The IDPs from the Lay Kay area who displaced in April and May 2022 expressed deep concern that they will get diarrhea from drinking unclean water and may contract dengue fever and malaria from mosquito bites in the forest. Some of the IDPs, especially infants, began suffering from diarrhea and vomiting, without access to medical treatment. IDPs from the local area requested medical supplies from Karen community-based organisations (CBOs), but they did not receive any., Displacement also has particularly heavy impacts on children, elders, new-born babies and pregnant women. One displaced woman from Bilin Township had a miscarriage after fleeing, and some pregnant women gave birth during displacement. The conditions of displacement pose great risks for both mother and child as they often have little to no access to clean water, insufficient food and shelter, no warm clothes for the baby, and no access to a health worker in the event of complications. Some children began experiencing high fever, but were unable to access medicine for treatment. According to one of the IDPs, Naw G----, who is a local health worker, “A lot of villagers, children, pregnant women and elders were facing difficulties and I feel so sorry to see them, but I could not help them because I am also struggling and I had to flee for my life. There are many pregnant women who are nearly due to give birth such as in D--- place [an IDP site]. It is better if people [humanitarian aid organisations] could support them. They do not have enough water and food; they could not return to their village to get more food or water. […] One of the aunties [an IDP] said that her child got a high fever, one local nurse/medic visited her child but they do not have medicine for treatment in the hiding site. […] They [IDPs] need tarpaulin to protect themselves from the rain because they are fleeing to the valley. So, they will be in trouble without a roof in the rain.”, IDPs in some hiding places received a small amount of dry food such as noodles, oil and drinking water from the KNU, as well as some dry food from Karen Women’s Organisation (KWO). Some were also able to receive limited healthcare services from local health workers. However, this support is not enough for all of the IDPs currently in hiding places, so they need more food, especially rice and healthcare support. Heavy travel restrictions imposed by the SAC and the high security risks of travelling limit the amount of support available to IDPs. While ethnic service providers and some locally-based organisations are still able to operate in the area, international and border-based organisations struggle to access IDPs in Doo Tha Htoo District, which is too far inland for many organisations to reach due to the heavy restrictions on travel and the transportation of food, medicine and supplies imposed by the SAC, as well as the SAC attacks on aid workers. This has left many displaced villagers in the area without access to lifesaving support., As stated in UNHCR’s guiding principles on internal displacement,[10] it is required that IDPs are able to request and receive protection and humanitarian assistance, with particular reference to certain vulnerable civilians including children and expectant mothers. It is evident that in Doo Tha Htoo District, the deprivation of necessary humanitarian assistance is leaving many villagers struggling with their livelihood needs, as many international and cross-border organisations are unable to reach those who need it most and are being deliberately denied access to these populations by the SAC., IDPs wish to return home and to live with their families in peace and safety. As one IDP, Naw W--- expressed, “We want to live in peace, we hope to see our houses when we return home. We worry that our houses will be burned down. There are no [KNDO] soldiers in the village. If they [the SAC] drop bombs, the bombs will destroy the houses.”, D. Use of Human Shields and Porters, On May 1st 2022, SAC troops [battalion number unknown] and BGF Company #2 led by Company Commander Bo[11] Tin Win, left Tha Gaw Play (Ta Tan Oo) and Plaw Hpoe Toe army camps in Dwe Lo Township, Mu Traw District to reinforce troops in Lay Kay army camp in Bilin Township, Doo Tha Htoo District. BGF Company #2 is under BGF Battalion #1014 led by Battalion Commander Bo Maw Chi, and is temporarily based in Plaw Hpoe Toe area (Dwe Lo Township, Mu Traw District)., Between May 1st and May 5th 2022, soldiers from SAC [battalion unknown] and BGF Company #2 arrested over 100 villagers from T’Kaw Hpoe and Weh Pyar village tract, Hpa-an Township to be used as human shields and porters on their way to Lay Kay and Ta Paw army camps in Bilin Township. On May 1st 2022, soldiers from the SAC and BGF Company #2 arrested two big groups of villagers [over 50 people] at a wedding and a novitiation ceremony in Weh Pyar village, Weh Pyar village tract, Hpa-an Township. The villagers are themselves from Weh Pay and T’Hkaw Hpoe village tracts. It happened when villagers were gathering for the ceremonies., Through May 5th 2022, SAC and BGF soldiers continued to arrest (for use as porters and human shields) local villagers in Hpa-an Township who travelled on the road to Lay Kay. Some of these detained villagers were able to pay a bribe of over 100,000 kyats [USD 47.62][12], and some detained villagers’ family members paid a bribe of over 200,000 kyats [USD 95.24] for their release. Some detained villagers, who knew the soldiers prior to being arrested and had formed a relationship with them, offered to buy them tea in exchange for their release. Villagers who were released were threatened, as they were told by BGF soldiers not to publicly report the case. Over 40 villagers remained arrested following these releases. SAC and BGF soldiers would not accept bribes from the majority of villagers, as the soldiers said that the villagers were needed as human shields rather than as a means to make money., On May 6th 2022, the SAC and BGF troops continued to head to Lay Kay army camp, Bilin Township with over 40 detained villagers and set up camp beside Noh Law Plaw village, Ha T’Ree village tract, Hpa-an Township for one night., On May 7th, SAC and BGF troops arrived at Ler Hklaw village, whereupon fighting broke out between these troops and the local KNDO. Following the fighting, the SAC and BGF soldiers gathered every villager from Ler Hklaw village in the monastery compound. They eventually released all the female villagers and younger children, but they took about 22 male villagers from Ler Hklaw village, including four underage boys, to use as human shields and forced porters as they continued travelling to Lay Kay army camp., The SAC and BGF also arrested villagers from other villages on the way to Lay Kay army camp. Villagers believe that approximately 100 male villagers had been arrested and used as human shields and forced porters. Some of the villagers were forced to wear BGF military uniforms so that villagers would be shot instead of soldiers if attacked by the KNDO. The SAC and BGF troops, along with the 100 arrested villagers, arrived at Lay Kay army camp on May 8th or 9th 2022 [the exact date cannot be determined] and the villagers were detained at Lay Kay army camp after their arrival there. The detained villagers remained under the control of the SAC and BGF and they could not escape. However, two villagers managed to escape and return home, but risked their lives to do so, with the SAC and BGF firing guns at them several times. The two escaped porters did not feel secure to stay at home and worried that the BGF and SAC would come to the village again, so they fled to other places for their security., An update on May 25th 2022 found that all of the detained villagers in Lay Kay village were released on May 22nd, the same day that the BGF withdrew from Lay Kay and Ta Paw army camps. [Only the BGF withdrew, the SAC remained at the army camps.] The SAC and BGF gave them 150,000 kyats [USD 71.43] each as payment for their daily labour; earning 10,000 kyats [USD 4.76] per day for 15 days of work as porters and human shields., The use of human shields is a violation of international humanitarian law and is prohibited under Additional Protocol II (Article 13(1)) of the Geneva Conventions by the requirement that “the civilian population and individual civilians shall enjoy general protection against the dangers arising from military operations”. In addition, deliberately using civilians to shield military operations is contrary to the principle of distinction and violates the obligation to take feasible precautions to separate civilians and military objectives. The use of children for such activities is also a violation of children’s rights, and can be considered a form of child conscription,[13] and thus a war crime under the Rome Statute (Article 8(2)(e)(vii))., E. Looting, While SAC and BGF troops gathered Ler Hklaw villagers in the village monastery on May 7th 2022, soldiers broke into villagers’ houses, shops and school dormitories and took two phones, gold, food rations, clothes and other villagers’ property. After village leaders reported the looting to the soldiers’ commanders, on May 8th 2022, the SAC and BGF soldiers paid some shopkeepers for what they had stolen, and returned the gold and phones of some villagers. However, villagers did not receive payment for other stolen items, such as their clothes., When SAC and BGF troop reinforcements arrived at Lay Kay village on May 8th or 9th [exact date uncertain], all Lay Kay villagers had already fled to different areas, leaving most of their possessions behind in the village. The BGF and SAC soldiers entered the village and broke into villagers’ houses and shops and looted villagers’ property such as their clothes, livestock for meat, food, toothpaste, toothbrushes, betel nut and related items [for consumption preparation], logs [for building] and any other materials that they saw. The soldiers brought to their army camp (at Lay Kay) huge amounts of the food and materials that they had looted, as well as logs and wood that villagers were storing to build houses and bunkers and to sell to other villagers. It is likely that the villagers who were detained in the army camp [as mentioned above] were forced to carry these looted goods for the soldiers. Villagers believe that the soldiers also stored other looted food in the monastery as they may not have had enough space in their army camp. Looting also occurred in Ta Paw village, Ta Paw village tract, Bilin Township located close to Ta Paw army camp., The looting and pillaging of villages is considered a war crime under the Rome Statute (Article 8(2)(e)(v))., F. Forced Return, On May 12th, SAC and BGF soldiers from Lay Kay army camp ordered IDPs from Lay Kay village, especially villagers hiding in caves and areas around Lay Kay Rocky Mountain, to return to their villages. They also ordered Lay Kay monks who had displaced to return to their monastery. BGF troops knew where to find the villagers as they have operated in the area for a long period of time and knew where villagers frequently go to hide. They were able to find them not far from the village. According to an IDP, Naw G---, the soldiers used threats towards villagers stating that they would burn down the village if villagers did not return. The SAC and BGF soldiers visited their hiding sites every day for several days, also threatening to attack them in their hiding sites. According to a displaced villager, Naw A---, the SAC and BGF told the villagers, “Come back!! Return and stay in the village. We will not take responsibility [guarantee] that indiscriminate shelling [will not] happen in your [hiding] place outside of the village.”, Villagers did not feel secure returning home due to the ongoing fighting in the villages, as well as the risk of being used as human shields to protect SAC and BGF soldiers from KNDO attacks. Furthermore, according to villagers who returned, the soldiers who were staying in villagers’ houses were frequently drunk and would have arguments amongst themselves. On some occasions, soldiers would even shoot their guns at each other. Yet, due to the ongoing threats by the SAC and BGF, some villagers were forced to return to their villages [the number of villagers is unknown]. Others however fled to various places further away. The monks who were forced to return to Lay Kay monastery had to live amongst SAC and BGF soldiers who were also staying in the monastery. These monks were frightened and were not able to stop the violence that was occurring in the village. The villagers who returned also had to live amongst SAC and BGF soldiers who based themselves in empty houses in the village. They were not allowed to leave the village once they re-entered. It is likely that the soldiers forced the villagers to return in order use these villagers as human shields. The village would less likely be attacked by the KNDO as long as villagers were present amongst the SAC and BGF soldiers., G. Sexual Harassment, Young girls who were forced to return to Lay Kay village faced the risk of sexual abuse by SAC and BGF soldiers. These young girls felt insecure as soldiers were making jokes and teasing them, as well as chasing them through the village. Some villagers secretly sent their younger daughters to hiding sites to protect them from sexual abuse and harassment, so only older women and men were left in the village. One IDP, Naw A--- from P’Yah Raw village tract, said that due to the presence of soldiers in the village, “I do not let my younger sister return to the village because I am afraid [fear sexual violence against her]. We just have to wait and see the situation from afar [at the hiding site].”, The situation was particularly traumatic for some women, who worried that this sexual harassment would lead to other abuses similar to those that they had faced in the past. Sexual violence has long been used by the Burma military as a weapon in its reign of terror, leaving female villagers throughout Southeast Burma constantly in fear that they will be the target of these gender-based attacks.[14], Conclusion, On May 22nd 2022, all BGF troops withdrew from Lay Kay and Ta Paw army camps. Villagers do not know why the BGF withdrew from their army bases or what their future plans are, but the situation in Lay Kay village calmed down a bit following the BGF’s withdrawal. Therefore, some Lay Kay villagers decided to return to their village. Although BGF troops withdrew, SAC troops have remained at their army camps, and continue to engage in activities that impact local villagers. Villagers must also be cautious about the increased UXO from the recent attacks and the landmines that the SAC and allied forces actively continue to plant. Villagers also fear the return of fighting in the area., While this report only covers a one-month period of increased military offensives, and is limited to just one of the seven districts in Karen State, it is reflective of the oppression and human rights violations that villagers throughout Southeast Burma are currently facing. The SAC and its allied forces have been deliberately attacking civilians and civilian areas in clear violation of international law. In the Lay Kay area in Bilin Township, no military targets were in the vicinity of the villages cited in this report. Victims of these attacks were forced out of their homes, and many returned to find their property damaged or stolen, and their houses burnt to the ground. They are living in constant fear of targeted attacks, and their lives are further placed in danger by being used as human shields both as part of troop movement and in their own homes to protect soldiers who have occupied their village., Hence, it is with urgency that the perpetrators of these human rights violations be held accountable for their actions. The international community must recognise that the SAC is the root cause of the current humanitarian and human rights situation, and cut off the possibility for the SAC to continue terrorising and attacking civilians. Furthermore, the international community must support those villagers who have lost their homes and livelihoods by directing funding to local service providers and civil society organisations (CSOs) and CBOs. Increased funding to local networks can ensure that support can reach further into districts that are located away from the Thai-Burma border, like Doo Tha Htoo District, where the possibility of external support is much more limited., Further background reading on the security situation and human rights violations in Doo Tha Htoo District and Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, “Undeniable: War crimes, crimes against humanity and 30 years of villagers’ testimonies in rural Southeast Burma”, December 2022., “Doo Tha Htoo District Incident Report: SAC shelling injured two villagers, killing one in Hpa-an Township, January 2022”, December 2022., “Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: Killing, torture and use of human shields and navigators by the SAC and BGF in Bilin Township, May to June 2022”, August 2022., “Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: SAC troops arbitrarily detain seven villagers, March 2022”, June 2022., “Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: Deliberate SAC shelling at religious event results in civilian deaths, injuries and property damage in Tha Htoo Township, March 2022”, April 2022., *“Military Atrocities and Civilian Resilience: Testimonies of injustice, insecurity and violence in Southeast Myanmar during the 2021 coup”*¸ November 2021., Footnotes:, [1] The Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO) was formed in 1947 by the Karen National Union and is the precursor to the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). Today the KNDO refers to a militia force of local volunteers trained and equipped by the KNLA and incorporated into its battalion and command structure; its members wear uniforms and typically commit to two-year terms of service., [2] The State Administration Council (SAC) is the executive governing body created in the aftermath of the February 1st 2021 military coup. It was established by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on February 2nd 2021, and is composed of eight military officers and eight civilians. The chairperson serves as the de facto head of government of Burma/Myanmar and leads the Military Cabinet of Myanmar, the executive branch of the government. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of SAC chairperson following the coup., [3] The term most commonly used in referring to Burma/Myanmar’s armed forces is Tatmadaw. The term has been used by KHRG throughout its reporting history, and most consistently during periods of civilian government. Since the February 1st 2021 coup and the military’s establishment of the State Administration Council (SAC) as the executive governing body of Burma, Burma’s armed forces have also come to be referred to as the SAC military. KHRG uses the term SAC military in specific reference to the Burma military since the February 1st 2021 coup. During previous periods of military rule, KHRG also used the names adopted by the military government in referring to the Tatmadaw (i.e. SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council] between 1988 to 1997, and SPDC [State Peace and Development Council] from 1998 to 2011), because these were the terms commonly used by villagers in KHRG research areas., [4] Border Guard Force (BGF) battalions of the Tatmadaw were established in 2010, and they are composed mostly of soldiers from former non-state armed groups, such as older constellations of the DKBA, which have formalised ceasefire agreements with the Burma/Myanmar government and agreed to transform into battalions within the Tatmadaw., [5] On October 15th 2015, after a negotiation process marred with controversy over the notable non-inclusion of several ethnic armed groups, a Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) was signed between the Burma/Myanmar government and eight of the fifteen ethnic armed groups originally invited to the negotiation table, including the Karen National Union. It was followed by the adoption of a Code of Conduct by the signatories in November 2015. In February 2018, two additional ethnic armed groups signed the NCA under pressure from the Burma/Myanmar government., [6] In Burma/Myanmar, the scorched earth policy of 'pyat lay pyat', literally 'cut the four cuts', was a counter-insurgency strategy employed by the Tatmadaw as early as the 1950s, and officially adopted in the mid-1960s, aiming to destroy links between insurgents and sources of funding, supplies, intelligence, and recruits from local villages., [7] The Karen National Union (KNU) is the main Karen political organisation. It was established in 1947 and has been in conflict with the Burma/Myanmar government since 1949. The KNU wields power across large areas of Southeast Myanmar and has been calling for the creation of a democratic federal system since 1976. Although it signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement in 2015, relations with the government remained tense., [8] This information was taken from the KNU Doo Tha Htoo News facebook page, from a post dated April 20th 2022., [9] KHRG, “Southeast Burma Field Report: Intensification of armed conflict, air and ground attacks, and widespread human rights violations, July to December 2021”, March 2022., [10] UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), “Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement”, 22 July 1998., [11] Bo is a Burmese title meaning 'officer'., [12] All conversion estimates for the kyat are based on the December 22nd 2022 mid-market exchange rate of 1,000 kyats to USD 0.48 (taken from https://wise.com/gb/currency-converter/mmk-to-usd-rate)., [13] See UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), “The Paris Principles.

"Taw Oo District Situation Update: Fighting, displacement, killing, and villagers’ livelihoods in Htaw Ta Htoo Township, April to July 2022",Situation Report,KHRG,"Education
Health
Protection and Human Rights",23 Dec 2022,"KHRG # 22-325-S1, This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Htaw Ta Htoo (Htantabin) Township, Taw Oo (Toungoo) District during the period between April and July 2022, and includes incidents of killing, fighting, displacement, and State Administration Council (SAC) military activity. On April 14th and May 23rd, two local villagers suspected of being SAC informants were killed in Hper Htee area. Since the SAC presumed the People’s Defence Force (PDF) to be responsible for the deaths, they tried to arrest villagers whom they suspected of supporting the PDF. A separate killing incident took place on May 11th, when a drunk SAC police officer shot dead a 14-year-old student in A--- Section, Zayet Gyi Town. Later the perpetrator escaped to avoid being punished, thus justice has not yet been achieved for the victim or his family. The SAC set up more checkpoints in the area, forcing local villagers to pay arbitrary taxes. This has contributed to restrictions on villagers’ movement and livelihood challenges. This update also covers health care, education, and other livelihood issues in Hper Htee area, Htaw Ta Htoo Township.[1], State Administration Council (SAC) [2] military activities, Between April and June 2022, tensions rose between the SAC and People’s Defence Force (PDF),[3] which increasingly became a problem for villagers. On April 14th 2022, a villager suspected of being a da lan [SAC informant], who lived in a majority ethnically Burmese village [Shwe Nyaung Pin village] near B--- village, Mo Kaung village tract,[4] Htaw Ta Htoo (Htantabin) Township, Taw Oo (Toungoo) District, was shot. [The SAC presumed that the da lan was killed by a PDF member.] On the morning of April 15th 2022, SAC soldiers patrolling outside of B--- village entered villagers’ [farm] huts and rummaged around them [likely looking for evidence of PDF members]. After they finished searching villagers’ huts, more than 10 SAC soldiers entered B--- village but no one knew exactly which unit they were from. They carried weapons with them when they came. There was a communion in an Anglican church around 11 am that day, and people who were in the church were worried and afraid because of the presence of SAC soldiers outside of the church. The soldiers returned to the Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[5] #73 army camp later that day on April 15th., On April 16th 2022, the SAC soldiers came back to B--- village again because they heard that there were PDF fighters or Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM)[6] participants in the village. When they were in the village, they randomly entered a villager’s house, and one of the soldiers pointed his gun at a young boy who was in a hammock underneath the house [unclear if they had a reason to suspect that he was a PDF member]. However, the soldiers finally left the house because the boy, who was the son of the house owner, did not do anything. Since the SAC soldiers came and conducted an investigation in the village, the village schoolteachers who participated in the CDM were afraid and worried [about being targeted and arrested by the SAC but remained in the village]. [Other] villagers no longer dared to stay in their huts [villagers displaced temporarily into the forest]., On May 23rd 2022 at 5:56 pm, another villager suspected of being an SAC da lan [informant] was shot dead on the vehicle road in front of Nyaung Pin Zay market, Kin Mun Chon village [Hper Htee area, Htaw Ta Htoo Township]. The [suspected] SAC da lan, Zaw Lin Htawy, was 45-years-old and lived in Zayet Gyi Town. The person who killed the [suspected] da lan was a member of a Da Lan Clearing Team [multiple armed groups are emerging targeting SAC informants]. However, this information is uncertain [nobody knows what happened or how and why it happened]. Following this incident, the SAC would occasionally arrest local villagers, alleging that they were providing support to or communicating with the PDF. The SAC also tried to look for CDM schoolteachers in order to arrest them, however none were arrested., Fighting and shelling, On May 8th 2022 at around 9 pm, fighting [between the SAC and combined forces of the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[7] and PDF] took place in the army camp of Infantry Battalion (IB)[8] #73 in the vicinity of Zayet Gyi Town. [PDF and KNLA soldiers attacked the army camp.] It lasted almost one hour. On June 12th 2022, fighting broke out again at the army camp of IB #73. During this skirmish, mortar shells and small guns were fired many times. The fighting started at 8 pm and finished at 9:30 pm [on June 12th 2022]. As the army camp of IB #73 is close to villages, villagers were full of fear and concern. [There was however no damage to the village or casualties]., At the beginning of July [2022], SAC troops from Toungoo Town passed through Zayet Gyi Town when they travelled to Ler Doh area [Kler Lwee Htoo (Nyaunglebin) District]. As fighting also happened in Ler Doh area, some villagers from Leh Doh came to seek refuge in Zayet Gyi Town, while others went to seek refuge in Taw Oo P’Ku School’s compound, in Toungoo Town. It is a bible school. Local church committee members and villagers in the area provided the displaced villagers with food and other support. However, as of late July, some displaced villagers from Zayet Gyi Town already returned to their villages [in Ler Doh area]., Killing case, On May 11th 2022 at around 8:30 pm, Maung[9] Myo Myat Htun (also known as Paul Tar Gyi) was killed in his house in A--- Section, Zayet Gyi Town, Htaw Ta Htoo Township, Taw Oo District. The victim was a 14-year-old Bamar[10] villager who lived with his parents and siblings in a house next to the Zayet Gyi police station. His parents are U[11] Poe Hla Min and Daw[12] Maw Maw Oo. On the day in question, Maung Myo Myat Htun was looking after his sick mother and feeding her porridge. At night [on May 11th 2022], the electricity was cut off [in their house]. Therefore, Maung Myo Myat Htun turned on the flashlight on his phone in order to be able to see. When he [the victim] was feeding his mother porridge, a drunk [SAC] police officer, Htun Htun Win, shot at him from the police station. Maung Myo Myat Htun was hit by two bullets and died at once. During the incident, the victim’s two sisters and father were not at home. On that night, only Maung Myo Myat Htun and his mother stayed at home., The next morning [May 12th 2022], the victim’s grandfather went to ask Htun Htun Win, the police officer responsible for the killing, why he shot and killed his grandson. The police officer replied that he just shot people because he could not see people clearly [he could not distinguish between people at night]. Then, they [Htun Htun Win and Maung Myo Myat Htun’s grandfather] held an [informal] meeting with U Poe Hla Min, Maung Myo Myat Htun’s father. The police called his father to come to the police station for a negotiation meeting. His father was told that they [the police] would give him 500,000 kyats [USD 238.09][13] as compensation for his son’s death in order to settle the case. However, U Poe Hla Min did not accept their offer. He replied, “I have lost my son. My son’s life is not worth only 500,000 kyats. I cannot accept it.”, The victim’s father could not follow up in order to file a complaint against the police officer [due to a lack of finances for the court costs and doubt over whether the process would achieve justice]. Furthermore, the chief of police at the Zayet Gyi police station was not present in the police station [making it challenging to file a complaint]. During that time, Htun Htun Win, the police officer in question, fled from the area [in order to avoid punishment]. On May 13th 2022, Maung Myo Myat Htun was buried., Travel restrictions, The situation regarding SAC activity [in Hper Htee area, Htaw Ta Htoo Township, Taw Oo District] has not improved yet. The SAC tried many ways to impose restrictions on the villagers’ freedom of movement [between May and July 2022]. At their checkpoints, they [the SAC] increased the questioning and interrogation of local villagers in the area. They increasingly demanded local villagers [transporting items] to pay toll fees [at their checkpoints]. Sometimes they also asked local villagers to provide them with alcohol and beer when villagers travelled [through their checkpoints]., Due to SAC activities, it is not easy to travel freely for trade [livelihood activities] like before. As the SAC also set up more checkpoints in the area, they increasingly asked villagers to pay them taxes (toll). This made it increasingly difficult for villagers to travel for trade., Health care, There have been small changes [improvements] in the healthcare situation in the area [Hper Htee area, Htaw Ta Htoo Township, Taw Oo District]. In the past, local villagers could not travel freely in the area due to the COVID-19 pandemic and they could not freely go to church [due to COVID-19 regulations on mass gatherings]. Nowadays, there are just a few positive COVID-19 cases found in the area and almost every villager in Hper Htee area, Htaw Ta Htoo Township received a COVID-19 vaccination [from either the Karen Department of Health and Welfare (KDHW) or the SAC Ministry of Health, as the area is under mixed control]. The SAC also tried to improve the healthcare situation in the area by rebuilding two hospitals: Zayet Gyi (Zayatgyi) public hospital and Htantabin General Hospital. The healthcare situation has slightly improved for local villagers. If villagers are sick, they can go to the hospital to get medical treatment [villagers in Hper Htee area are now willing to seek treatment at SAC-run hospitals because SAC soldiers are not present at the hospitals anymore, and the fees are cheaper than at private clinics]. Between May and July 2022, villagers also could go to church. Villagers do not face many barriers if they have to travel for health reasons., Education, The education situation has improved slightly as well in the period between May and July 2022. In the past, students could not go to school due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the political situation. At the time of reporting in July 2022, the COVID-19 situation has been getting better. Therefore, local villagers were able to open schools. In Hper Htee area, Htaw Ta Htoo Township, some Karen villagers opened a self-funded school. They used the Karen Education and Culture Department (KECD)[14] education system and KECD curriculum in their school. Some villagers who live near the KNU-funded [KECD] Hto Lwee Wah school sent their children to that school. In some villages, SAC-run schools were also opened. [According to local villagers], students who attend self-funded schools receive high quality education as they use the KECD curriculum. Students who attend SAC schools do not receive quality education as they use the SAC curriculum. In some SAC schools, they did not have sufficient schoolteachers. Also, some teachers did not teach students well [as the teachers showed up late to class and were not invested in students’ progress, according to villagers]. However, this year the education situation has improved a bit because students have been able to go and study at [all of] the schools [whether KNU/KECD, self-funded or SAC]., Most of the villagers said that they wished the political situation would get better as soon as possible. Local villagers were criticized by fellow villagers if they sent their children to [SAC] schools as they were accused of supporting the SAC. However, if they did not send their children to school, their children would not know how to read and write. Therefore, villagers had many concerns when they sent their children to SAC schools. They were also worried that a bomb would explode [near the SAC schools], or that there would be gunfire. Villagers wanted to send their children to Hto Lwee Wah High School [a KECD school] but some of their children were just in primary school, therefore, they could not attend Hto Lwee Wah High School [and there is no KECD primary school in the area]. Villagers faced many challenges in their daily lives., Livelihood challenges, At the time of reporting in July 2022, it was not easy for villagers to earn a livelihood because the political situation was not good and the price of commodities increased. In addition, day labourers and workers had not gotten a salary [wages] increase [likely due to the ongoing economic crisis]. Therefore, it was not easy for them to support their families’ livelihood., On July 11th 2022 at around 12:30 pm, [SAC] soldiers and traffic police tried to catch three-wheel motorcycle drivers in Zay Lay area [a market] in Toungoo Town. Some three-wheel motorcycle drivers earned their livelihood as transporters [offering transportation services to people] and some three-wheel motorcycle drivers earned a living as food sellers. If [SAC] soldiers and traffic police caught a three-wheel motorcycle driver, they would fine the driver 20,000 to 30,000 kyats [USD 9.52 to 14.29]. It became difficult for local people to earn a livelihood. In every job that local villagers did, they could not do their work freely. They had to work for their livelihood full of fear and anxiety. [In Hper Htee area, villagers were required to have a COVID-19 vaccination certificate from the KNU in order to travel, which cost 1,000 kyats [USD 0.48]. In order to travel and work far from the village, villagers were required to have a work travel document, which villagers had to pay for. In addition, hill farmers were interrogated on their way to their farms, restricting their ability to safely travel to work]. As some villagers did not have jobs or could not work freely, they left their homes and villages and then they went to other countries, including Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, to get jobs. Some villagers also had financial issues and they had to borrow money [from others]., Conclusion, In my opinion [according to one KHRG researcher], the people in the country [Burma] will have a very small percentage [chance] to get peace if the SAC continues to take the [hold onto] power. In Hper Htee area, Htaw Ta Htoo Township, Taw Oo District, we feel like we still have to live full of fear and anxiety. We face many challenges in our area. We do not get full freedom and rights in terms of livelihood, education, health care, and movement., Further background reading on the security and human rights situation in Taw Oo District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, “Taw Oo District Short Update: SAC activities, March to April 2022”, May 2022., “Taw Oo District Situation Update: SAC military activities, SAC attacks on CDM participants, travel restrictions, and livelihood, healthcare and education challenges, December 2021 to February 2022”, April 2022., “Taw Oo District Short Update: Killing, shelling, displacement, and the destruction of a COVID-19 screening checkpoint and villagers’ belongings by SAC soldiers, March 2022”, March 2022., “Taw Oo District Incident Report: A villager’s house was damaged by indiscriminate gunfire from a drunk SAC military officer in Daw Hpa Hkoh Township, August 2021”, December 2021., Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in July 2022.

LIBs are primarily used for offensive operations, but they are sometimes used for garrison duties., [6] On February 2nd 2021, healthcare workers at state-run hospitals and medical facilities across Myanmar spearheaded what is being referred to as a Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) consisting of labour strikes in protest against the February 1st 2021 military coup. The movement quickly spread to include civil servants from all sectors of the government who are walking off their jobs as a way of non-recognition and non-participation in the military regime.

"Dooplaya District Interview: SAC air strikes damaged buildings in Thay Baw Boh village, Kaw T’Ree Township, May 2022",Situation Report,KHRG,Protection and Human Rights,23 Dec 2022,"KHRG # 22-203-A1-I1, This interview describes events that occurred in Thay Baw Boh village, Thay Baw Boh village tract, Kaw T’Ree (Kawkareik) Township, Dooplaya District in May 2022, including air strikes and shelling, which resulted in the destruction of local community buildings and displacement.[1], Interview | Thay Baw Boh village, Thay Baw Boh village tract[2], Kaw T’Ree (Kawkareik) Township, Dooplaya District (May 2022), Name: Saw[3] A---
Gender: Male
Age: N/A
Religion: Christian
Ethnicity: Karen
Family Status: Married
Occupation: Pastor, Could you please introduce yourself to me? What is your name? Where are you from? My name is Saw A---. I am a pastor. I live in Thay Baw Boh village, Thay Baw Boh village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township, Dooplaya District., What is your position in the village? My position in the village is secretary of the school committee., Could you please tell me as much information as you know about the air strikes [on May 18th 2022]? When the air strikes were conducted, I was in Meh K’Neh village, Noh Hpoh village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township but my wife was here in Thay Baw Boh village. The air strikes began between 9 am and 10 am on May 18th 2022. I knew that there was an aircraft doing reconnaissance on the targets of the air strikes; and three aircraft conducting the air strikes. The air strikes were conducted almost 20 times [20 separate attacks of gunfire and/or bombs]. [The interviewee heard this information from others as he was not in Thay Baw Boh at the time. It is unclear how the number of aircraft involved was determined.], What type of aircraft conducted the air strikes? It was fighter jets. All four aircraft were fighter jets, including the aircraft that conducted reconnaissance., Were three aircraft conducting air strikes? Yes, three were conducting air strikes and one was determining the target for the air strikes., As you mentioned, the air strikes were conducted almost 20 times. How many days did it take to carry out the air strikes? The air strikes were conducted on just one day [May 18th 2022] at 9 am and ended at 3 pm., Do you know the battalion number of the SAC [State Administration Council][4], [5] battalion that conducted the air strikes? I do not know about that., Can you please tell me a bit regarding the property damaged in the village? No villagers were injured but some houses around the Bamar[6] [SAC] military outpost were damaged. There were about seven or eight houses damaged. The monastery was also damaged by the gunfire [from the fighter jets], not [bombs from] the air strikes. Our church was hit by the air strikes. As we know exactly, three bombs [from the fighter jets] hit our church [the total number of bombs dropped that day is unknown]. The church community hall was hit by one bomb but plenty of gunfire hit its walls. Mirrors, doors, ladders [stairs], and instruments [musical equipment] such as an amplifier, piano, drum, and loudspeaker were damaged. The piano cannot be used anymore. The loudspeaker could probably be fixed and used again. We’ll just keep the damaged instruments as a memory [of the church property we had]., As you mentioned gunfire, was it from the fighter jets or guns? It was from the fighter jets. The fighter jets used both machine guns and air strikes [bombs]., What kind of bombs did the fighter jets use? The bombs which were dropped by the fighter jets were similar to RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] shells but they were a bit bigger and longer. The shell was made from metal., What is the cost [value] of the damage to the instruments? We bought the piano for 35,000 baht [USD 964.72].[7] The drum was 17,000 baht [USD 468.58]. The drum was hit a bit. We can use it again if we fix it., How about the amplifier? The amplifier was not hit by the air strike shrapnel. It was just hit by the falling of timber [from the building] so it was not completely broken. It just got flattened a bit. One guitar was not hit by the fallen timber or the shelling fragments. We can use some of the instruments such as the electric guitar and amplifier., Have the damaged parts of the church and hall been fixed? We have not fixed them yet. We are waiting for the situation now [for the attacks to reduce]. When the situation gets better, we will fix it. As I have checked, if we repair both the [church community] hall and the church, it will cost not less than 500,000 [baht (USD 13,781.70)]. It cost us 1,280,000 baht [USD 35,281.15] when we built the church., Was anyone in the village displaced? During the incident, there were some villagers who were displaced. After the Bamar [SAC] military camp in Thay Baw Boh [village] was occupied [by the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[8] on May 18th 2022][9], every villager was displaced. Now [as of June 1st 2022], 75 per cent of villagers have returned to the village., From your perspective, why were the air strikes launched upon Thay Baw Boh village? From my perspective, the air strikes were conducted so that their [the SAC’s] soldiers in the Thay Baw Boh army camp would be able to escape from attack [by the KNLA]., Which side [of the village] is the army camp located in? The Bamar [SAC] army camp is located right in front of the church., Do you know the battalion number of that SAC camp? No, I do not know it., What did you think when the SAC camp in the village was occupied [by the KNLA]? What I mean [think] is that, the soldiers [the SAC] from this army camp always threatened villagers by firing guns and carrying out indiscriminate shelling in and around the livelihood areas and the village since December 2021. Because of that, our people’s combined forces [KNLA and Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO)[10]] were trying to occupy this army camp. We are happy about this, but even with this [SAC] army camp gone [taken], we still have to live in fear of attacks from the air., When saying “the army camp is gone”, do you mean that they [the SAC] withdrew their soldiers? It is not that they withdrew their soldiers. During the fighting, they [the SAC] had around 70 soldiers in the army camp. According to the frontline [KNLA] soldiers who occupied this army base, there were six SAC soldiers who died in the fighting and seven who were captured alive. [There has been no update on what happened to the captured SAC soldiers]. Most of the other soldiers fled to escape. The KNLA and KNDO soldiers saw when they fled and tried to chase them but they could not make it [catch the soldiers]. I would say that they [the SAC soldiers] escaped; some crossed the Moei River to Thailand and some fled to their comrades [in other units]. Then, some fled toward Aoo Kray Hta village [where an SAC army camp is located]., How long has the [SAC] army camp been based in Thay Baw Boh? This army camp has been based in Thay Baw Boh [village] since 2010., Since this army camp has existed since 2010, I would like to know the relationship between Thay Baw Boh villagers and the SAC soldiers. Before the coup, the relationship was good. There is no more peace, unity and love in our relationship since the fighting started. As they [the SAC] have a lack of trust, they carry out pressure and threats [put pressure on us and make threats]., As you mentioned previously that eight houses were damaged, were the houses damaged by the air strikes or ground shelling? The houses were not damaged by shelling. As I mentioned to you earlier, the houses were shot by Oerlikon [machine guns on the fighter jets]. The church was hit by both Oerlikon [gunfire] and three bombs [dropped by fighter jets], the hall was hit by one of the fighter jet bombs. Altogether, four bombs hit the church and hall., Have the displaced villagers returned to the village? Yes, some have returned and are living in the village now. But, we have not started to practice farming for our livelihood again. Seventy-five per cent of displaced villagers have returned to the village., How is the security in Thay Baw Boh currently? For the security situation, our brothers [KNLA, KNDO] who are based in this area are taking care of our security. They have set the defensive position [are taking protection measures, for instance, by occupying the SAC’s army camp] probably for our civilians to live peacefully and are taking full responsibility for the security issue [the protection of civilians]., How many households and people are there in Thay Baw Boh? Before there were 236 households but I do not remember the number of people in the village., What is your perspective as a pastor in seeing the damage [to the church, hall and houses] in the village from the SAC air strikes? I feel bad in seeing the damaged church and houses. However, I have realized one thing: that the SAC tries to use violence to obtain power and get control of the country. It is not a strategy for peace and love. For our [Karen] people, our demand is justice and equality but the Bamar [SAC] is controlling us without equality., What is your perspective on why the SAC uses air attacks as part of the civil war? In my perspective, they [the SAC] use air attacks in the civil war because their armed forces on the ground have become weakened. They use air attacks to be able to resist and invade our people’s [Karen] areas. It is the only way for them because just a few soldiers remain on the ground. Using air attacks has a big impact on our people [Karen], who adore peace and fight for equality. We [Karen people] also try to abide by the UN policy [of democracy and human rights]. However, since their [the SAC’s] future objective is not what we [Karen people] agree with, they try to destroy our region with air strikes., Why do you think the civil war is happening [in Burma]? The current civil war is being carried out because of the coup. For Karen people, we do not see ourselves as dictators. Instead, we want to gain unity for civilians [all ethnic groups] and we want our country to cooperate with the UN [for democracy and human rights]. For Bamar soldiers [the SAC], they want to take over power and control the country as a dictatorship., Would you like to suggest or say anything else to the international community or the UN regarding the civil war and air strikes in Thay Baw Boh village? We want our brothers [KNLA/KNDO], and our people who are living in second [Thailand] or third countries [other international countries], to cooperate and look for a way to report cases [of air strikes on civilians] to the UN or other international communities [organisations] so the world will know and be aware of the situation affecting our people [Karen]. We need them [the UN or international community] to put pressure on the SAC, so that our people will gain freedom, equality and be released from persecution. What I want to say is that the SAC is increasing air strike attacks. There should be no more of these activities [air strikes]. If possible, democracy shall be upheld to solve the political issue together in order to achieve equality. This is what I want to say and let everyone know., Do you want to add any other things to all authorities in the country [Burma] for Thay Baw Boh villagers to live peacefully? In Thay Baw Boh village, as well as every brigade/district where Karen people live in Karen State, even in Htee Hta Sway [Irrawaddy Division], I hope that everyone [Karen people in Burma] participate in the movement for us to gain peace. I hope that the governing authorities shall not take illegitimate power as dictators. If so, we will build up peace, love, harmony, and unity. That’s what I want others to hear. May they [authorities who stand against the dictator] also stand with God. There may be many different religions in Burma such as Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and others. But, may we put God first in our own way [belief] and build up unity. That is what I want to say for today., Do you have any other things to say? Yes, I would like to thank God because he has done great things for me. I have been working here [Thay Baw Boh village] as a pastor since 2001. It is about 20 years by now so I would like to thank God for keeping me alive. I would also like our siblings [Karen people around the world] to remember us in their prayers based on the current situation. Then, I want our brothers also to remember us in their prayers for what we have go through today. For the future, we wish that we will get to live under peace and freedom of movement. That’s what my wish is for today., Further background reading on the security and human rights situation Dooplaya District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, “Dooplaya District Incident Report: A 15-year-old female student reported being sexually assaulted by a school committee member, November 2021”, July 2022., “Dooplaya District Situation Update: Fighting, indiscriminate shelling, displacement, landmine injuries, travel restrictions and torture, December 2021 to February 2022”, June 2022., “Dooplaya District Situation Update: Killing, fighting, indiscriminate shelling, air strikes and displacement, March 2022”, May 2022., “Dooplaya District Interview: The SAC’s indiscriminate shelling killed a 17-year-old girl and injured three other villagers, March 2022”, May 2022., Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in May 2022.

"One year after the Christmas Eve attack near Moso Village, Myanmar - statement by Nicholas Koumjian, Head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar [EN/MY]",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,23 Dec 2022,"23 December 2022 –Tomorrow it will be one year since 30 people, including at least one child, were killed and their bodies burnt on a road near Moso Village, Hpruso Township. For the past year, the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar has been actively collecting and analysing information about this and other alleged serious international crimes committed across Myanmar to help ensure that the perpetrators one day face justice., In the year since the 24 December tragedy, we have collected and analysed evidence of an array of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Myanmar, from Rakhine state in the west to Kayah in the east, including evidence of murder, rape, torture, unlawful imprisonment, and deportation or forcible transfer. The evidence concerns crimes committed over many years, including persecution of Rohingya and attacks on other minorities since 2011, to more recent events affecting almost all parts of the country. Tragically, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of deliberate or indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian locations like schools, hospitals and churches over the course of the year. Armed attacks that target civilians or indiscriminate attacks that affect civilians are prohibited by international laws of war and can be punished as war crimes or crimes against humanity., International justice can be a slow and painstaking process. Criminal investigation requires a long-term commitment to gathering evidence. Collecting this information while it is fresh is essential to see justice served. The evidence is not meant to gather dust in an archive, but to eventually be used in a court of law where perpetrators will be prosecuted. We are already sharing evidence, with the consent of people who gave us the information, with those working on ongoing cases concerning the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice., The Mechanism is very grateful and inspired by the courage of those individuals who come forward with information concerning the crimes that they have suffered or witnessed. The testimonies of witnesses and survivors of any crimes we are investigating, or their families, friends or colleagues, are vital for us to build criminal cases. Equally important are people with knowledge of illegal orders or policies. We encourage anyone who has information about serious international crimes in Myanmar to contact us through our secure and confidential channels., Information on how to communicate securely and confidentially with the Mechanism can be found athttps://iimm.un.org/contact-us/confidential-and-sensitive-communications/, The Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM or Mechanism)* was created by the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2018 to collect and analyse evidence of the most serious international crimes and other violations of international law committed in Myanmar since 2011. It aims to facilitate justice and accountability by preserving and organizing this evidence and preparing case files for use in future prosecutions of those responsible in national, regional and international courts.

Crowdfunding a War: The Money behind Myanmar’s Resistance,Analysis,ICG,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,20 Dec 2022,"Anti-military groups in Myanmar have crowdfunded successfully over the past eighteen months despite regime efforts to deprive them of resources. Fundraisers should take steps to shield contributors from retribution, while international donors should work with local groups to channel aid to hard-hit civilians., What’s new? Myanmar’s junta and the forces arrayed against it are locked in a battle over funding, both to raise their own revenue and to deny their opponents access to the same. The resistance has used new technologies alongside traditional mechanisms to get money and bypass regime restrictions on moving it., Why does it matter? The junta’s financial reserves will play a big part in how the conflict in Myanmar unfolds, as will its adversaries’ ability to keep attracting donations. Regime restrictions designed to cut off funding to resistance forces are also harming aid groups, thus worsening the country’s humanitarian crisis., What should be done? Resistance forces should seek expert advice on the use of new technologies, notably on data security to protect people giving money. Given growing constraints on the delivery of humanitarian aid, donors should deal directly with local partners, potentially adjusting regulations that are unduly burdensome for these groups., Executive Summary, Funding has been a central concern for Myanmar’s junta and its opponents since the first days after the February 2021 coup d’état. Both sides have sought not only to raise money but also to deny it to their foes. The regime, with its control of the levers of state, has the advantage. But anti-military groups have held their own, adopting a variety of crowdfunding techniques, including innovative online methods, that have secured them enough resources to sustain a multi-faceted resistance movement. The amounts are far short of that required to threaten the junta’s hold on power, but the regime has been unable to cut off the flow of funds. The conflict’s trajectory now depends in part on whether resistance forces can keep donations streaming in – and find more. They should seek expert advice on data security so as to ensure that people giving money are protected. Meanwhile, regime restrictions aimed at the resistance are hurting humanitarian operations across the country. International donors should work more closely with local organisations to ensure that aid reaches people in need., Post-coup Myanmar is a vivid example of how conflict parties can weaponise the internet, a trend that is increasingly evident around the world. Against the odds, opposition forces have raised significant sums – possibly in the hundreds of millions of dollars – to help them fight the military regime. The mobilisation of funds, much of it in small individual donations from the diaspora, has been made possible by Myanmar’s digital revolution and the democratisation of financial services over the past decade. This revolution created not only new means of raising and moving money, but also the knowledge people in Myanmar needed to take advantage of these tools., Widespread internet access has also been essential to efforts to weaken the military regime financially. Here, the results have been mixed. Some initiatives have been highly successful, such as the mass boycott by people in Myanmar of military-owned beer brands and their refusal to pay electricity bills. But others have had little impact or even been counterproductive, such as civil society groups pressuring the French energy conglomerate TotalEnergies to withdraw from the country. That campaign ended up providing the regime with more oil and gas revenue, since it was able to assume part of TotalEnergies’ stake in a gas project for free., While Myanmar’s anti-military forces have raised significant funds, like many decentralised insurgencies they have found it difficult to move money to where it is needed. Even with its unsophisticated monitoring instruments, the regime has been able to push most opposition groups out of the formal banking system, sowing enough fear to make many in the country hesitate to donate to its adversaries. Anti-junta forces, particularly the National Unity Government (NUG), a parallel administration formed by opposition lawmakers, have also faced challenges using the international banking system, sometimes falling foul of regulations meant to police money laundering and terrorism financing. In response, the NUG has begun using new technologies like cryptocurrency and blockchain, but these efforts remain embryonic; for the most part, anti-military groups have relied on informal remittances to skirt the regime’s banking restrictions., The military regime enjoys significant economic advantages over the resistance, because it controls the Central Bank and state assets, and because it enjoys coercive power over the private sector. But it has struggled to maintain economic stability, due to a combination of widespread domestic opposition to its rule, global factors and its own economic mismanagement. The junta has exacerbated the crisis by imposing strict capital controls, rationing imports and fixing the exchange rate artificially high, further undermining confidence in its aptitude and triggering a revival of informal money transfers that go straight to resistance forces., Funding will be an important factor shaping the conflict’s trajectory. The junta, despite strenuous efforts, has been unable to stop money and other resources from reaching resistance groups, mostly due to the ubiquity of unregulated informal remittance systems that are largely outside of its control. On the other hand, fatigue may set in among the diaspora that has contributed much of the financial support to the NUG and other anti-military groups, particularly as for now it appears unlikely that the resistance will succeed in ousting the regime. So far, the NUG has managed to sustain its fundraising campaign with creative tactics, but these would benefit from additional outside expertise, particularly when it comes to ensuring data security so that contributors are safe from the junta’s retribution., Thus far, little suggests that foreign governments will stop outside funds from reaching resistance forces, and they are right not to try. Foreign capitals are understandably reluctant to give the resistance weapons or cash, but any measure to starve it of diaspora funding would be a step too far. Such measures would not necessarily bring fighting to a close; it might subside in some areas, though that is not guaranteed, and in any case the regime might then carry out reprisals, including against civilians. Cutting off the flow of funds would exacerbate the Myanmar population’s grievances, as the majority remain angry not only about the coup but also about the world’s response. Indirectly, it would support an illegitimate regime that has committed atrocities on a daily basis to crush opposition. It would do nothing to resolve Myanmar’s many ethnic conflicts; instead, it might enable the junta to train its sights on ethnic armed groups. For foreign powers, in sum, avoiding action to close down diaspora funding is an expression of solidarity with the regime’s opponents, yet one that stops short of providing weapons., The battle between the regime and the resistance has also hindered delivery of life-saving humanitarian aid. Desperate to keep resources out of resistance hands, the regime is closely watching all incoming transactions, and in so doing it is starving NGOs of the funds they need to carry out programming. Given the increased scrutiny, donors and international aid organisations should make better use of local civil society actors to reach conflict-affected populations. Many have already introduced flexibility into their procedures, but shrinking humanitarian space means they will likely need to relax their operating and reporting requirements even more to keep aid flowing to the hardest-hit civilians. They should also regularly review these policies in light of the fast-changing circumstances. To reach as many people as possible, international actors should send aid through multiple channels, including cross-border assistance – in goods where feasible, but also in the form of cash – and non-state service delivery systems, such as those run by ethnic armed groups., Yangon/Melbourne/Brussels, 20 December 2022",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/crowdfunding-war-money-behind-myanmars-resistance
UN Security Council: Historic Censure of Myanmar Junta,News and Press Release,HRW,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",21 Dec 2022,"First Such Resolution Recognizes People’s Brave Calls for Democracy, (New York) – The United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution on December 21, 2022, denouncing the Myanmar military’s rights violations since the February 1, 2021 coup, Human Rights Watch said today. The landmark resolution, passed with 12 yes votes and 3 abstentions, reflects the Myanmar junta’s growing isolation generated by security force abuses amounting to crimes against humanity and war crimes., It is the first Security Council resolution on Myanmar since the country, formerly known as Burma, acquired independence from Britain in 1948., “The Security Council resolution is a momentous step on behalf of the people of Myanmar, opening the door toward holding Myanmar’s brutal generals to account,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The resolution should bring renewed scrutiny to the junta’s daily atrocities and recognition of the Myanmar people’s brave efforts toward democracy and freedom.”, The resolution, which the United Kingdom drafted under the UN Charter’s Chapter VI concerning “pacific settlement of disputes,” expresses deep concern at the “ongoing state of emergency imposed by the military in Myanmar on 1 February 2021 and its grave impact on the people of Myanmar.” It condemns the military’s execution of pro-democracy activists, urges the military to “immediately release all arbitrarily detained prisoners,” and demands an “immediate end to all forms of violence throughout the country.”, The resolution includes numerous references to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which adopted a “five-point consensus” in April 2021 in response to the Myanmar coup. Junta chief Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing has since defied each point of the consensus while exploiting the international community’s deference to the regional bloc, Human Rights Watch said. The secretary-general or his special envoy on Myanmar is tasked with reporting orally by March 15, 2023, to the Security Council on UN support for implementation of the five-point consensus., All Security Council members voted for the resolution, except for China, India, and Russia, which abstained., The junta’s widespread and systematic abuses since the coup – including extrajudicial killings, torture, and indiscriminate attacks on civilians – amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes. Security forces have killed over 2,600 people and arbitrarily arrested over 16,000, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners., The military has expanded abusive operations in ethnic minority areas, displacing more than one million people, and deliberately blocked humanitarian assistance from reaching populations in need as a form of collective punishment. The resolution calls for “full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access,” expressing deep concern at the “increasingly large numbers of internally displaced persons and dramatic increase in humanitarian need.”, Activists in Myanmar have pressed for a Security Council resolution on the country for decades. China and Russia vetoed a 2007 draft condemning the then-military government’s attacks on civilians and detention of political prisoners. Calls for a resolution by UN experts, human rights groups, and others in response to the atrocities against the Rohingya in 2017 went unanswered. This was largely due to China and Russia’s resistance, but also concerns on the part of Western governments of alienating the now-ousted civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been in military custody since the coup., The Security Council has issued statements of condemnation on Myanmar in the past and received numerous briefings from UN experts and the secretary-general. Under resolutions of the Security Council Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict, the council has debated reports on abuses against children in Myanmar. This resolution represents a significant escalation of the council’s engagement on Myanmar and offers a basis for sustained future monitoring of the situation in the country, Human Rights Watch said., This first-step resolution should be followed by close monitoring and reporting on the junta’s compliance and further action by the council. Human Rights Watch has long called on the Security Council to impose a global arms embargo, refer the country situation to the International Criminal Court, and impose targeted sanctions on junta leadership and military-owned companies. The initial draft of the resolution called for an immediate end to arms sales to Myanmar, which was later removed., “China and Russia’s abstentions signal that even the junta’s few friends have lost interest in sticking out their necks to defend its atrocities,” said Louis Charbonneau, UN director at Human Rights Watch. “The building blocks put in place with this resolution offer a starting point for reinvigorating pressure on the junta among Security Council members and governments across the globe.”, Your tax deductible gift can help stop human rights",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/un-security-council-historic-censure-myanmar-junta

"Myanmar: Action needed to stop carnage, says UN expert after adoption of Security Council resolution",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,22 Dec 2022,"GENEVA (22 December 2022) -- While noting that the UN Security Council has adopted a resolution on Myanmar for the first time since a military coup nearly two years ago, Tom Andrews, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, responded by stating that the crisis in Myanmar will worsen unless and until Member States of the UN respond with action. The UN expert released the following statement:, ""It is notable that the UN Security Council has passed a resolution on Myanmar for the first time since the military unleashed a brutal crackdown on the people of Myanmar nearly two years ago. I appreciate the efforts made by the United Kingdom and other Security Council Members to craft and advance a resolution that managed to avoid a veto., With all due respect to the Security Council, however, 'expressing deep concern' and demanding that certain actions be taken without any use of the Security Council's Chapter VII authority, will not stop the illegal Myanmar junta from attacking and destroying the lives of the 54 million people being held hostage in Myanmar. What is required is action., The systematic gross human rights violations -- amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity -- being perpetrated daily on the people of Myanmar by an illegal military junta requires strong, coordinated action by UN Member States. The demands put forward in the resolution -- including 'an immediate end to all forms of violence,' the release of political prisoners, the need for unimpeded humanitarian access, and the need to respect the rights of women and children -- are critically important but what is missing are consequences for the failure to meet them and the imposition of sanctions and accountability for crimes the military has committed to date. I wholeheartedly agree with Security Council members Norway, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Iceland, and Mexico that the language of the resolution should have been stronger., ""What the content of this resolution makes clear is that the action that is required to end this crisis will not come from the Security Council. It is therefore imperative that those nations with the political will to support the people of Myanmar take coordinated action immediately to end the carnage. The Security Council resolution should not become a dead-end that is followed by more international inaction. It should be a wake-up call for those nations who support a people under siege., It is clearly time for the creation of a working coalition of nations who are willing to stand with the people of Myanmar by providing what they need most -- action., UN Secretary-General Guterres was correct when last month he declared that, with respect to Myanmar, the international community has failed. This failure cannot be rectified by resolutions that have no consequences. It can only be responsibly addressed with targeted, coordinated action. There are viable options for Member States who are prepared to address this failure, including coordinating sanctions, cutting off the flow of revenue that is financing the junta's military assaults, an embargo on weapons and dual-use technology and robust humanitarian aid that can reach those most in need, among other measures. What is required is the political will to seize them."", ENDS, Mr. Thomas Andrews (United States of America) is the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar.

Myanmar: UN Security Council resolution a small but important step in addressing human rights crisis,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,21 Dec 2022,"After the UN Security Council today adopted a long-overdue resolution demanding an end to the violence and immediate release of all arbitrarily detained persons, Amnesty International Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said:, “With the adoption of this resolution, the Security Council has finally taken a small but important step to acknowledge the dire situation in Myanmar. The Council must now follow up with regular open meetings and enforce its demands with additional resolutions under Chapter VII.”, The resolution failed to include other measures urgently needed to address the situation in the country, including a comprehensive arms embargo, targeted sanctions against military leaders responsible for grave human rights violations, and a referral of the situation to the International Criminal Court., “The military authorities must abide by the resolution, immediately end the violence and release arbitrarily detained prisoners. The Council should further proceed to impose a comprehensive arms embargo, including on aviation fuel, and targeted sanctions against military leaders,” said Callamard., “This resolution should be a message to the Myanmar military that they cannot continue their grave human rights violations and attacks against civilians. The Council is watching.”, Background:, Amnesty International continues to call on the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court (ICC) as soon as possible, in order to begin to address the impunity which has prevailed for both the atrocities against the Rohingya and crimes committed since the February 2021 coup. The Council has only twice used its power to refer atrocity situations to the ICC (Sudan & Libya), and must now urgently refer the grievous situation in Myanmar., Almost two years after the February 2021 military coup, over 1.4 million people are displaced inside Myanmar, more than 13,000 people are detained in inhumane conditions, at least 73 people remain on death row, and 7.8 million children are out of school., The Myanmar military has killed more than 2,600 people since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. The victims include peaceful protesters, pro-democracy activists and other civilians. The Myanmar military has flagrantly ignored calls to respect human rights, including the ASEAN five-point consensus which they agreed to implement in April 2021., The atrocities since last year’s coup follow the brutal military campaign of crimes against humanity in 2017 that drove out more than 740,000 Rohingya from Rakhine State into Bangladesh by extrajudicial executions, arson and sexual assault. An estimated one million Rohingya refugees now live in Bangladesh, and many of their villages back in Rakhine State have been wiped from the map.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-un-security-council-resolution-small-important-step-addressing-human-rights-crisis

"Security Council Demands Immediate End to Violence in Myanmar, Urges Restraint, Release of Arbitrarily Detained Prisoners, Adopting Resolution 2669 (2022)",News and Press Release,UN SC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",21 Dec 2022,"SECURITY COUNCIL
9231ST MEETING (PM), SC/15159, The Security Council today called for the immediate end to all forms of violence in Myanmar and urged restraint, the de-escalation of tensions and the release of all prisoners., Adopting resolution 2669 (2022) (to be issued as document S/RES/2669(2022)) by a vote of 12 in favour to none against, with 3 abstentions (China, India, Russian Federation), the 15-member organ demanded an immediate end to all forms of violence throughout the country and urged restraint and the de-escalation of tensions. It also urged the Myanmar military to immediately release all arbitrarily detained prisoners, including President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi., By its terms, the Council reiterated its call to uphold democratic institutions and processes and pursue constructive dialogue and reconciliation in accordance with the will and interests of Myanmar’s people. All parties must respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, it urged while acknowledging the central role of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in finding a peaceful solution to the crisis and encouraging the international community to support the ASEAN-led mechanism and process in this regard. It called for concrete and immediate actions to effectively and fully implement ASEAN’s Five-Point Consensus — which called for an immediate cessation of violence and constructive dialogue among all parties, among other things — and requested that the Secretary-General or his Special Envoy on Myanmar provide an oral report to the organ by 15 March 2023 on the Organization’s support to that end., Also by the text, the Council reiterated its support for the ASEAN Special Envoy’s efforts to engage intensively with all relevant parties in Myanmar with a focus on promoting fully inclusive and representative dialogue, encouraged close cooperation with the United Nations Special Envoy and urged all parties in Myanmar to work constructively with both Envoys to commence dialogue to seek a peaceful solution in the interests of that country’s people., In reiterating the necessity for full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access, the Council underlined the need for scaled-up humanitarian assistance to all people in need in Myanmar and to ensure the full protection, safety and security of humanitarian and medical personnel., The Council also underscored the need to address the root causes of the crisis in Rakhine State and create the conditions necessary for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of Rohingya refugees and internally displaced persons. It encouraged diplomatic efforts between the parties concerned to help address the issues facing the Rohingya, further stressed the importance of providing continued protection and assistance to refugees and displaced persons, and decided to remain seized of the matter., Following the adoption of the resolution, many Council members voiced their support for ASEAN with several commending the organ for its action as others voiced their concerns over the text’s nature and content., Through this first resolution on the situation in Myanmar, the Council has responded to the calls of ASEAN leaders for support and sent a firm message to the military, the representative of the United Kingdom commended. It also sent a message to the people of Myanmar that it seeks progress in line with their rights, wishes and interests., The Council must use this opportunity to seek additional ways to support the implementation of the ASEAN Five-Point Consensus and promote accountability for the regime’s actions, the United States’ speaker encouraged. Despite being a strong next step in addressing the military regime’s egregious behaviour, the Council did not go far enough and should have directly addressed the severe violations of the freedom of religion and belief. It could have also recognized and condemned the continued sale and transfer of arms to Myanmar, widespread sexual and gender-based violence and the importance of accountability mechanisms, his colleague from Ireland added., The representative of the Russian Federation then spotlighted proposals which were ignored by the penholders to demonstrate the counterproductiveness of unilateral restrictive measures. Council members must not destabilize the situation on the ground and undermine ASEAN’s mediation efforts, he cautioned before turning his attention to the text’s lack of balance. Given the main focus on the human rights situation in Myanmar, the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) would have been a better discussion forum, he suggested while noting that his country did not block the resolution., Agreeing with his fellow Council member over the text’s imbalance, China’s speaker said it would have been more appropriate to adopt a presidential statement as he explained his country’s abstention., The complex situation in Myanmar calls for quiet, patient diplomacy, the representative of India stressed in explanation of her country’s abstention. Any other course will not help resolve outstanding issues and may even entrench the parties in inflexible positions. The Council must carefully weigh its action and consider the interests of neighbouring countries most affected by instability in Myanmar, she urged., Also speaking today were the representatives of France, Norway, United Arab Emirates, Ghana, Ireland, Brazil, Albania, Mexico and Gabon., The meeting began at 3:03 p.m. and ended at 3:39 p.m., Statements, BARBARA WOODWARD (United Kingdom) pointed out that the Council resolution — the first on the situation in Myanmar — is the result of many weeks of careful consultation with that organ’s members, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other key regional partners. In February 2021, she recalled, the military overturned the results of a democratic election, seized power and plunged that country into a series of cascading humanitarian, economic and political crises. The coup has also had negative consequences for the region and its stability including by exacerbating the challenges facing the Rohingya. Through its adoption, the Council has responded to the calls of ASEAN’s leaders for the Organization to support its efforts. As the Secretary-General’s mandated briefing next March will be an important opportunity to assess developments on the ground, her Government stands ready to take further action as necessary. Today, the Council sent a firm message to the military that it expects the full implementation of this resolution and to Myanmar’s people that it seeks progress in line with their rights, wishes and interests, she said., NATHALIE BROADHURST ESTIVAL (France), welcoming the adoption of the resolution, stressed that it was essential for the Council to express its concerns and demands towards the junta in support of Myanmar’s people and in light of the situation’s continued deterioration. The gravity of this situation requires unanimity, she said, regretting the abstentions of other members while recalling the resolution’s four main messages. Civilians, especially women and children, must stop suffering violence by that country’s security forces. France, she continued, denounces the serious violations committed by the junta against the civilian population who have been severely affected by repression. On the situation of the Rohingya, she spotlighted her country’s response and support, which included voluntary contributions to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 2022. ASEAN’s Five-Point Consensus must be a central part of the conflict’s resolution, she emphasized., ZHANG JUN (China) pointed out that it would be more appropriate for the Council to adopt a presidential statement, noting that the tone of the text lacks balance. Therefore, China abstained, he said, stressing that there is no quick fix for the Myanmar issue and the solution to the conflict depends on Myanmar itself. The large-scale prisoner release in November by the Myanmar authorities should be recognized and encouraged, he noted, underscoring that ASEAN has a unique advantage in dealing with Myanmar-related issues. He thus encouraged the international community to listen to ASEAN’s views, support its leadership and allow the organization time and space to build consensus. Recalling that the Council unanimously issued 10 outcome documents on Myanmar in 2021, he spotlighted China’s participation and consensus. Reiterating China’s policy of friendship towards Myanmar, he expressed full support for ASEAN and the implementation of the Five-Point Consensus., TRINE SKARBOEVIK HEIMERBACK (Norway) saying that her country voted in favour of the resolution, condemned the military coup in 2021, emphasizing that the people of Myanmar deserve sustained attention and support. She encouraged a closer collaboration between the United Nations and ASEAN in implementing the Five-Point Consensus. Commending the adoption of the resolution, she expressed regret that it was not possible to agree on a more substantial draft and recalled that Norway advocated for stronger language on the protection of children and education in armed conflict; combating sexual and gender-based violence; ending impunity; and preventing the flow of arms and financial assets of the military., AMIERA ALHEFEITI (United Arab Emirates), welcoming today’s adoption, said that the resolution conveys an important message regarding the need to address the challenges facing the Rohingya and the crisis in Rakhine State. This is important for the whole region, especially at a time when international interest in the Rohingya is regressing. She noted, however, that the language of the resolution — despite the importance of the crisis — is insufficient, stating that her delegation hoped for stronger language that would address the scope of the challenges in Myanmar. She called for further international efforts to solve the Rohingya crisis, respond to the deteriorating humanitarian situation and create an enabling environment for the voluntary, safe, sustainable and dignified return of refugees and internally displaced persons. For its part, the United Arab Emirates will continue assisting refugees — especially women and children — and act to reduce their suffering, including through support to Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) efforts to address the conflict. She went on to welcome that the Council supported ASEAN’s Five-Point Consensus, which is the most effective way to end the crisis. Underlining the importance of regional efforts, she called on the international community to support the same to achieve peace in the region., ROBERT A. WOOD (United States) welcomed the adoption of the resolution, noting that it is a strong next step in the Council’s efforts to address the Myanmar military regime’s egregious behaviour. However, it does not go far enough, he said, adding that the Council should directly address the regime’s severe violations of freedom of religion and belief and call directly for the regime to face justice for the crimes it has reportedly committed. Moreover, the Council should not overlook the General Assembly’s resolution in support of an arms embargo and pursue a mechanism to prevent the flow of financial resources to the regime. Those measures are critical to ending the bloodshed, he added. Given those realities, the adoption of the resolution is an important start forward in the conversation within the Council on Myanmar, he said, noting that the Council must use this opportunity to seek additional ways to support implementation of the Five-Point Consensus and promote accountability for the regime’s actions., HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana) said the Council has responded to ASEAN’s call for the United Nations and other external partners to support its efforts in the implementation of the Five-Point Consensus. There should be no doubt that the international community expects the military junta to reverse its repressive policies and commence actions which show respect for the rule of law and the fundamental human rights of all of Myanmar’s people. Not surprisingly, the persistent overruling of the will of Myanmar’s people by the military authorities since February 2021 has only worsened the plight of that country, he pointed out. Only through dialogue can this unsustainable governance situation — which has created insecurity in the country and beyond with widespread humanitarian consequences — be resolved. As such, State authorities should embrace the efforts of ASEAN, the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy and other stakeholders to bring this crisis to an end, he encouraged., FERGAL TOMAS MYTHEN (Ireland) reiterating that the Council’s actions in response to the violence in Myanmar have been inadequate, suggested that the Council should have convened an open briefing. Noting that Ireland voted in favour of the resolutions to combat the cycle of violence, he outlined that the Council could have recognized and condemned the continued sale and transfer of arms to Myanmar, the widespread sexual and gender violence and violations against children, and the importance of the accountability mechanisms, such as the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar. Further, it could have directly called on the military to stop its assault on the people of Myanmar. Spotlighting that the resolution is a pivotal moment in the Council’s response, he urged it to maintain a dedicated focus on the situation., RONALDO COSTA FILHO (Brazil), spotlighting the difficulty in achieving a Council reaction to ongoing developments in Myanmar, welcomed the positive engagement of all Council members that has finally allowed the organ to speak on the situation in that country. Further, he welcomed the inclusive, transparent manner with which the United Kingdom conducted negotiations and allowed the Council to arrive at the text adopted today. Adding that Brazil has always stressed the need for the international response to the situation in Myanmar to take its lead from ASEAN, he welcomed that the Association was involved and consulted throughout the process., FERIT HOXHA (Albania) said the milestone text should go a long way to support the basic aspirations of the Myanmar people denied by the brutal military coup. “It was about time that the Council did its part,” he underscored, noting that the decision shows the Council’s ability to respond to the growing calls for support in Myanmar in finding a peaceful solution to the deep crisis in the country. With today’s result, the Council has responded to ASEAN leaders and has made the right choice to stand with the Myanmar people. He welcomed the focus on the plight of the Rohyinga, emphasizing that they must not be forgotten. He commended the work of the United Kingdom as file sponsor for producing a balanced, yet important text. He called on all relevant parties to support the full implementation of the Five-Point Consensus from ASEAN and ensure accountability for crimes committed., LUIS GERARDO ELIZONDO BELDEN (Mexico), noting that his delegation voted in favour of the resolution, highlighted its focus on cessation of violence, respect for human rights and the need for an inclusive dialogue. The text calls for safe and unhindered humanitarian access, he said, adding that it also underscores the need to protect the civilian population, in particular women, children and minorities. It also stresses the need to establish the right conditions for the voluntary and dignified return to Myanmar of refugees. However, he noted that his delegation would have preferred that the text also include references to the importance of preventing the flow of weapons., MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon) stressed that his country’s vote was a message of solidarity with Myanmar’s people against violence targeting that country’s civilian population and an appeal to resolve the Rohingya crisis. It is also a message in support of ASEAN’s Five-Point Consensus and the humanitarian response. Gabon, he pledged, will continue to support the search for a solution based on dialogue and encourage the preference for a regional approach with ASEAN taking on a leading role., VASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) saying that his country abstained from voting, noted that the situation in Myanmar does not represent a threat to international peace and security. Pointing out that the text mainly focused on the human rights situation, he suggested that the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) would be a better discussion forum. Expressing dissatisfaction with the work of the penholders, who did not strive to agree on a balanced text, he pointed to proposals that were ignored as an indication of the counter productiveness of unilateral restrictive matters. While recognizing that States can have different opinions about the policies of the military Government, he stressed that Council members should not destabilize the situation on the ground and undermine ASEAN’s mediation efforts. Urging all Myanmar political forces to show restraint, he pointed out that the Myanmar military has confirmed its commitment to the Constitutional provisions that establish the timeframe for the state of emergency, with a view towards holding parliamentary elections in 2023. Noting that the resolution is not consensus-based, he said that the Russian Federation decided not to block it, recalling that the only topic on the Council’s agenda on Myanmar should be the situation in Rakhine State., RUCHIRA KAMBOJ (India), Council President for December, spoke in her national capacity to point out that her country shares a long border with Myanmar, along with historic and cultural links with its people. Therefore, any instability in that country directly impacts India, and resolving the current crisis is matter of national security. The welfare of Myanmar’s people remains India’s priority, and she said that the complex situation in Myanmar calls for quiet, patient diplomacy. Any other course will not help resolve outstanding issues and, under the current circumstances, a Council resolution may entrench the parties in inflexible positions — rather than encourage them to pursue inclusive political dialogue. She called on all parties to immediately cease hostilities, abandon extreme positions and initiate an inclusive political dialogue to restore democracy. On that point, she stressed that political leaders should be released and allowed to resume political activities. Adding that it is important to carefully weigh Council action, she urged the organ to consider the interests of neighbouring countries, who will be most affected by instability in Myanmar. In view of these concerns, her delegation abstained from the vote, she said., For information media.

Urgent Action Needed to Save Rohingya Adrift at Sea,News and Press Release,RI,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",20 Dec 2022,"Please see below statement from Refugees International Deputy Director for Africa, Asia, and the Middle East Daniel P. Sullivan:, “An alarming number of Rohingya refugees have been marooned at sea in recent weeks. Urgent action is needed to address the drivers behind these dangerous voyages and to save those still adrift., This month, at least three boats, each carrying more than 100 Rohingya from Myanmar or the refugee camps in Bangladesh, have spent weeks abandoned at sea. At least one boat remains at adrift. Yet regional governments have been slow to respond, and, even when saved, the refugees have been faced with detention or return to the genocidal regime that caused them to flee their homeland in the first place., The recent surge of dangerous sea voyages evokes memories of the May 2015 Andaman Sea crisis, during which some 3,000 Rohingya and Bangladeshis were abandoned by human smugglers. That crisis resulted in several pledges and proposals that could have avoided the current crisis, including setting up a regional task force and trust fund for mixed movements of refugees and migrants and agreeing to predetermined safe disembarkation points. Yet, the current response has largely only repeated the past., The drivers behind these desperate voyages must be addressed, both through enhanced coordinated global pressure on Myanmar’s military junta and through measures to empower Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh through improved protection and access to education and livelihood opportunities., But the most immediate need is for regional governments, including India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand to live up to their obligations to save those stranded at sea and to avoid moves like repatriation or detention that will only place vulnerable people in further danger.”, Refugees International recently released a report covering the dire conditions in the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh and recommending solutions. An earlier report following the May 2015 boat crisis highlighted the dangerous sea journeys and included recommendations for addressing them., For more information or to schedule an interview, please contact Refugees International’s Vice President for Strategic Outreach Sarah Sheffer at ssheffer@refugeesinternational.org.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/urgent-action-needed-save-rohingya-adrift-sea

Naw B---, an 88-year-old woman living in B--- village, and her 7-year-old grandson, Saw C---, were hit by fragments of the mortar shell [that landed close to their house]. [The victims did not have enough time to reach the bunker under their house before the shell exploded]. The grandmother was hit on the lower part of her belly, and the grandson was injured on his right clavicle. The injured woman and her grandson were initially treated at their home by village healthcare workers [who cleaned their wounds and gave them pain medicine] before they were taken to Pwa Ghaw hospital (P’Lan Taung Taik Naing hospital) in Pwa Ghaw village, Ha T’Reh (Ha T’Laik) village tract, Hpa-an Township., Before dawn on January 9th 2022, the injured villagers rented one of the A--- villagers’ cars and were driven by the car’s owner to Pwa Ghaw hospital, a 16-bed hospital [located an hour away by car from A--- village]. Naw B--- received treatment there for over a week [one week and two days] but she eventually passed away because her injury was very severe. Saw C--- was hospitalised for three days. The mortar shell fragments were removed from the grandson’s clavicle and he made a full recovery.

He then conducted an interview with Saw[4] B--- who is the husband of the victim, Naw Thoo Lei Paw., 2. Explain how the source verified this information., The source is the husband of the victim who visited the scene of the incident and saw the dead body at the place of the incident. Many other villagers also saw it [the scene of the incident] when they went to take the corpse to A--- village to bury it. Information in this incident report is based on these witnessed events., Part 3 – Complete Description of the Incident, Describe the Incident(s) in complete detail.

Also describe any villager response(s) to the incident, the aftermath and the current living situation of the victims. Please use the space prepared below, and create an attachment if needed., On September 17th 2022 at around 11:00 am, a displaced villager, Naw Thoo Lei Paw, from Taung Su village, Shwegyin Inn village tract, Moo Township was hit by shrapnel from a mortar fired by State Administration Council (SAC)[5] troops, when she was returning [from Taung Su village] to her site of displacement [another village]. She had gone back to Taung Su village to retrieve rice [to bring to the village she had displaced to]. She was hit by mortar shrapnel when she reached a paddy field at the entrance of the village [as she was leaving]. The shrapnel [from the mortar] hit her on her thigh, the back of the neck and foot, killing her instantly. The SAC [troop] responsible for this shelling is Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[6] #351, which [since July] has been temporarily based at Nant Thar Kwin Bridge [at the entrance of Taung Su village] and which is under the command of Captain Zay Yar Lin. Captain Zay Yar Lin is based at Ler Doh army camp., Before this incident happened, on September 9th 2022, the SAC forced displaced villagers from Taung Su, Noh Klaw, T’Ma Hkaw and Noh Ku villages in Shwegyin Inn village tract, Moo Township and Thel Kone, Nga Pyet Inn, Nyaung Kone (Hkler Hkoh), Ain Net villages in Ain Net village tract, Ler Doh Township, Kler Lwee Htoo District. According to a community member, the SAC troops that operate in Ler Doh and Nant Thar Kwin area [and that forced these villagers to displace] are LIB #590, Infantry Battalion (IB)[7] #60 and LIB #440, along with members of the pyithusit (“people’s militia”)[8]. In Shwegyin Inn village tract alone, there are 2,056 displaced villagers. KHRG was unable to identify the number of displaced persons from Ain Net village tract. According to a villager, [on September 9th] the SAC commanded the villagers to displace, saying: “You all have to displace by today. No one should stay in the village. If anyone stays, we will fire mortars into the village.” Villagers including women, children and newborn babies had to displace., As they were forced to suddenly displace, villagers could not carry much food with them. Therefore, some villagers [later] tried [go back to their village] to retrieve some food and check on their [plantations and] livestock. Due to the incident [the death of Naw Thoo Lei Paw], villagers are now afraid to return to the village to retrieve food and check on their plantations and livestock., A displaced villager, Naw C--- said, “The SAC forced us to displace. So, we are facing challenges. If the SAC gave us a site to relocate to, we would go and settle there. But now [instead], they just forced us to displace randomly. We didn’t know where to stay. So, we fled to the forest. We waited until the situation calmed down a bit, and we just snuck into the village like thieves to grab some of our food. If they had seen us, they would have shot us dead or arrested us. The SAC did not allow us to return to the village, but they entered our village and looted our belongings and our food.”, The situation has made it more challenging for villagers [to survive at the displacement sites, as they fear returning to the village]. They face huge difficulties while being displaced in other people’s houses, people’s farm huts and in the forest. Villagers who took refuge in their relatives’ and friends’ houses in nearby villages have to rely on their relatives and friends. Some other villagers are displaced in the forest areas along the road from Ler Doh to Moo Township., Some villagers displaced to Toungoo Town, Phyu Town and Kyauktaga Town located in Hpyoo (Phyu) Township [Bago Region]. Villagers are deeply concerned that they will not be able to harvest [their crops] if the situation continues. They are most concerned about potential food shortages in the coming year. Even though they were able to rely on their relatives and friends this year, they are highly concerned about potential food shortages [as they will not be able to produce crops this year]. A woman said, “We farm [to earn a living]. The paddy crops are not good because of unexpected rain this year. Moreover, the cattle were released [and are roaming freely] all over the village due to [the] forced displacement [of villagers]. Therefore, we are concerned about food shortages in the coming year.”, Part 4 - Permission for Using the Details, Did the victim(s) provide permission to use this information? Explain how that permission was provided., The husband of the victim granted KHRG permission to use this information., Further background reading on human rights issues in Kler Lwee Htoo District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, ""Kler Lwee Htoo District Situation Update: SAC air strikes, shelling and fighting, displacement, insecurity, and livelihood, education and healthcare challenges in Ler Doh Township, February to May 2022”, August 2022., “Kler Lwee Htoo District Short Update: SAC airstrikes destroyed two houses and resulted in the displacement of villagers in Ler Doh and Hsaw Htee townships, March to April 2022”, June 2022., “Kler Lwee Htoo District Situation Update: Violation of the right to information, travel restrictions, torture, increased SAC activities and displacement in Ler Doh and Moo Townships, August 2021 to February 2022”, April 2022., “Kler Lwee Htoo District Short Update: SAC troops fired mortars into a village, injuring three villagers, December 2021”, January 2022.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/kler-lwee-htoo-district-incident-report-indiscriminate-shelling-killed-displaced-woman-moo-township-september-2022

Strengthening support and inclusion for persons with disabilities amid humanitarian crisis in Myanmar,News and Press Release,UNFPA,"Gender
Health",20 Dec 2022,"“People think that we (persons with disabilities) cannot do anything. We want to show them our capacity that we can do like other people. Lack of support and discrimination make us more vulnerable to experience poverty, violence and limited access to essential services and information for our lives,” said Sabai, 20, a community person with physical disabilities in Yangon., According to 2019 Myanmar Inter-Censal Survey, 12.8% of the population (estimated 5.9 million people) are living with disabilities in Myanmar, and 12.4% for Yangon region. It means 896,242 people are living with disabilities in Yangon region alone. COVID-19 pandemic and political crisis have exacerbated the situation of persons with disabilities. It has imposed a triple burden on persons with disabilities particularly women and girls with disabilities. Moreover, persons with disabilities in Myanmar aged 15 and over are more than twice as likely to be unemployed than those without disabilities., The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) which was adopted on 13 December 2006, reaffirms that all persons with any type of disabilities must enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms., Myo Myo, 19, a local youth with physical impairment in Yangon said, “I applied for a job at a local sewing shop. When they saw my situation that I am with physical impairment, they rejected my application without any other reason. I was really sad and depressed at that time. Why didn’t they want to give me a chance? I have been asking myself that question again and again. There are no equal opportunities and equal rights for women in our society but even worse for women and girls with disabilities. Together with the support from international and local organizations, we can promote the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and provide awareness to change this community perception and end discrimination against persons with disabilities.”, Stigma and gender discrimination compound the denial of their rights and choices. Women with disabilities are up to 10 times more likely to experience gender-based violence and are often prevented from accessing health services including sexual and reproductive health information and services., UNFPA is working with local organizations in Myanmar to empower women and young persons with disabilities and ensure their full participation in public life. These supports include providing knowledge and awareness of SRHR and GBV, providing vocational trainings, business skill trainings, assistive devices to facilitate their mobility, communication and participation in the society and seed money for their income generation., Sabai has received vocational trainings and business skills trainings from one of the local disability organizations. With support of seed money, she opened a shop and sells Korean Rice Roll (Kimbap) and Grilled fish. She even manages to do the delivery with her e-bike., Myo Myo also received seed money and vocational training. She has started small business at her home, such as sewing and knitting crochets., Eri Taniguchi, Acting Deputy Representative of UNFPA, said, “Our intervention significantly contributes to initiate and promote the inclusive humanitarian and crisis response and disability-inclusive society in Myanmar. With our support through local partner organizations, mobility and assistive devices could improve the daily activities of persons with disabilities. They also help women and girls with disabilities access information and services related to sexual and reproductive health and gender-based violence and participate in respective trainings.”, It is important to provide information and services for persons with disabilities considering their specific needs based on major types of disabilities, e.g providing information with sign language for those with hearing impairment and delivering tailor-made services for those with visual and cognitive impairment. Through the right support and an inclusive approach, people with disabilities can attain a higher quality of life and enjoy their rights., “Like everyone else, I have a dream to achieve. I want to show the world that we are ‘Able’ meaning we have the ability to contribute to our community,” Sabai said., UNFPA works towards ensuring an accessible and equitable world where everyone has access to sexual and reproductive health and rights.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/strengthening-support-and-inclusion-persons-disabilities-amid-humanitarian-crisis-myanmar

"Mergui-Tavoy District Situation Update: SAC military activities and travel restrictions, livelihood challenges, education, an armed clash, displacement and indiscriminate shelling by the SAC, April to May 2022",Situation Report,KHRG,"Education
Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",20 Dec 2022,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in T’Naw Th’Ree (Tanintharyi), K’Ser Doh and Ler Muh Lah townships, Mergui-Tavoy District during the period between April and May 2022. The State Administration Council (SAC) conducted troop rotation, patrolled the area, and indiscriminately fired mortar shells into villages, which resulted in the displacement of villagers. Villagers from Pa Wa area in T’Naw Th’Ree Township have also been facing travel restrictions since the military coup, as SAC soldiers stop and investigate those travelling. Village leaders, appointed by the SAC, told students’ parents not to send their kids to Karen Education and Culture Department (KECD) schools and to only send them to SAC-run schools. On May 25th 2022, SAC soldiers fired at least 100 mortar shells into P’Na Mee village, P’Law area, Ler Muh Lah Township, displacing villagers from P’Na Mee village. SAC soldiers also indiscriminately fired around 10 mortar shells, destroying a monastery, injuring a monk, and killing a villager, following the fighting that occurred between them and the combined forces of the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) and People’s Defence Force (PDF) on May 10th 2022, between Kyaw Meh Taw village and Plaw Ner Moo village, K’Ser Doh Township.[1], State Administration Council (SAC)[2] military activities, Due to SAC [battalion number unknown] troop rotation and patrolling in the area, villagers from B--- village, Pa Wa area, T’Naw Th’Ree (Tanintharyi) Township were afraid and displaced to C--- village, Lay Nya Bok Pyin area, T'Naw Th'Ree Township. When they moved there, some villagers saw SAC soldiers [who were travelling along the road] and had to hide in the bushes beside the road. Villagers hid when they saw SAC soldiers because SAC soldiers usually ask a lot of questions when they encounter villagers. SAC soldiers also frequently beat villagers who they encounter if the villagers don’t answer their questions., At around 11:30 am on April 23rd 2022, SAC soldiers [from an unknown battalion] indiscriminately fired one mortar shell into the village, injuring five villagers from C--- village. The names of the villagers who were injured is unknown and the other villagers do not know where they received treatment. Villagers could also hear gunfire in the distance due to fighting between armed groups. Villagers displaced and had to hide in the forest as a result of the shelling. Villagers are still displaced and have moved from the forest to other villages. Some are staying with their relatives in other villages., Travel restrictions, Travel restrictions have become stricter in [Pa Wa} area since the military coup. Villagers have been facing travel restrictions because SAC soldiers are stationed beside the road and are asking a lot of questions [to local villagers who are travelling]. SAC soldiers have been indiscriminately firing guns lately. Therefore the SAC closed the main road that goes through Pa Wa area and vehicles could not travel. There was however no official announcement that the road had been closed. As a result, it has been very difficult for villagers to travel to receive medical treatment, even when they become very sick. [The nearest clinic is two hours away by motorbike during the dry season. It takes even longer during the wet season.] It has also been challenging for some villagers who don’t have a COVID-19 vaccination certificate. They are not permitted to travel, as SAC troops stationed at checkpoints prohibit their travel., Food shortages, Due to travel restrictions [and resulting livelihood challenges], villagers have been facing food shortages. Since April 5th 2022, the SAC has increased its checkpoints, and SAC soldiers have been disrupting the transportation of food supplies to villagers. Some villagers, especially families who work as day labourers, have already run out of food [as of May 2022], and some are only able to have porridge for their meals. Villagers have not received aid and thus are sharing what they have with each other., Education, In B--- area in T’Naw Th’Ree Township, some children wanted to go and study in Karen Education and Culture Department (KECD) schools [as a new term was starting], but SAC soldiers threatened [told village leaders who were appointed by the SAC to threaten] students’ parents by telling them that their children might join rebel groups if they went to study in KECD schools. As a result, some parents didn’t allow their children to go and study in KECD schools. Some village leaders also told the students not to study in KECD schools and to study in SAC-run schools only. However, while some children stayed in SAC-run schools, some have chosen to go and study in KECD schools., An armed clash and displacement, After receiving the news that SAC soldiers from Infantry Battalion (IB)[3] #433 [based in Kyauck Me Taung village] who went to Plaw Ner Moo village, Hkay Hta small area in Paw Hkloh large area, K’Ser Doh Township were coming back to Kyauk Me Taung village, K’Ser Doh Township by foot on May 10th 2022, Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO)[4] Company #2 and People’s Defence Force (PDF)[5] fighters prepared to conduct an ambush on that day. (It takes approximately 45 minutes by foot to travel between the two villages.) The SAC had arrived at Plaw Ner Moo village on the morning of May 10th 2022 and left the village in the afternoon. When SAC soldiers were on their way back from Plaw Ner Moo village to Kyauk Me Taung village on May 10th 2022, they were attacked by the combined forces of the KNDO and PDF between Kyauk Me Taung village and Plaw Ner Moo village. [They were attacked just outside of Plaw Ner Moo village.] Fighting started at 3:40 pm and it ended at around 5:00 pm. When the fighting stopped, SAC soldiers [unknown battalion number] currently based at the Kyauk Me Taung police station[6] indiscriminately fired around 10 mortar shells into K’Ser Ther Pler village [Taung Thon Lon village], destroying a monastery, injuring a monk, and killing a villager. The injured monk initially received treatment at Hsa Doh Wah clinic in K’Moh Thway area [Ler Doh Soh Township]. He was injured on the waist and was later sent to Yangon Hospital. Villagers have not heard anything since., While SAC soldiers were in Plaw Ner Moo village, villagers were afraid to leave their houses. When fighting happened after they [SAC soldiers] left [the village], Plaw Ner Moo villagers were afraid and fled from the village. Some of the villagers fled to their plantation fields, some fled to the forest, and some fled to [nearby] E--- village, Paw Hkloh area, K’Ser Doh Township., Due to the fighting outside of Plaw Ner Moo village, villagers from E--- village heard that SAC soldiers were coming, and so they [women and children] left their village. E--- village is located approximately one mile from Plaw Ner Moo village. SAC troops did not pass through this village but villagers were concerned that SAC soldiers would go to their village [after the fighting near Plaw Ner Moo]. Only men stayed behind in the village. Some of the villagers went to sleep at their plantations [outside of the village] and some went to stay in their hiding places in the forest. Although E--- villagers who had fled, returned to their village on May 12th 2022, villagers from Plaw Ner Moo village have still not dared to return to their village. Some villagers who had to displace went to F--- village, K’Ser Doh Township and G--- village in Ler Doh Soh Township. Some men returned to the village to check on their livestock, but they only returned during the day and then left the same day. They did not sleep there., SAC indiscriminate shelling, On May 25th 2022, SAC soldiers from LIB #285 [indiscriminately] fired mortar shells into P’Na Mee village, P’Law area, Ler Muh Lah Township, the whole day. They started shelling at around 9:00 or 10:00 am and the shelling did not stop until 8:00 pm. They fired at least 100 mortar shells. There were no injuries or damage from the shelling., Due to the SAC mortar shelling, village leaders sent P’Na Mee villagers, especially elderly people, women, and children to a more secure place. Villagers were not able to take food with them when they left the village [as they had to leave in a hurry]. Village leaders had to arrange transportation to send food to them later. Some villagers returned to the village but elderly people and children continue to seek refuge in H--- village, P’Law area, Ler Muh Lah Township. According to local authorities, villagers across the area are now living in fear and they are worried that the situation in their local area might become worse in the future., Further background reading on the human rights and security situation in Mergui-Tavoy District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, [1] The present document is based on information received in May 2022.

Protection and Human Rights",20 Dec 2022,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Bu Tho and Dwe Lo Townships, Mu Traw (Hpapun) District during the period between February and April 2022. State Administration Council (SAC) troops indiscriminately fired 68 mm, 81 mm, and 120 mm mortars into several villages in Bu Tho Township, injuring villagers and killing villager’s cows. In April, a villager from A--- village, A--- village tract, Dwe Lo Township, was attacked by a soldier from SAC Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) #407 at his home during the night. Until April 27th 2022, soldiers from the local People’s Defence Force (PDF) and Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) have been able to control the road between Kamarmaung and Hpapun towns. Moreover, on April 18th 2022, a villager from B--- village, Meh Klaw village tract, Bu Tho Township, was injured in a landmine explosion and she is currently receiving treatment at Wah Hka Der clinic in Dwe Lo Township.

Because of this, Saw M--- became dizzy. Before he recovered from his dizziness, Corporal [Min Zaw] tried to attack him with a sharp knife that he had brought with him. Although Corporal Min Zaw was trying to stab the parts of Saw M---’s body that could easily lead to death, he failed to do so because Saw M--- was trying to fight back. However, since Corporal Min Zaw repeatedly used his knife to stab Saw M---, Saw M---’s left ear was hit three times and his left hand was hit twice., Saw M--- was not able to travel anywhere else to receive treatment, so he went to receive treatment at the [SAC] LIB #407 army camp. After attacking Saw M---, villagers saw that Corporal Min Zaw hurriedly returned to the [SAC #407] army camp and therefore, A---’s village head, Saw N---, went to report this incident to the operations commander [from that army camp]. The operations commander refused to admit that Min Zaw was from their army camp., People’s Defence Force (PDF)[11] activity, Members of the PDF have been fighting in areas controlled by ethnic armed groups against the SAC, who seized power from the publicly [democratically]-elected government, the National League for Democracy (NLD)[12], on February 1st 2021., [Within the reporting period, ending on] April 27th 2022, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[13] together with the PDF in Mu Traw District have been able to control the road between Kamarmaung [K’Ma Moh] and Hpapun towns.

Protecting mental well-being of migrant workers in Shwe Pyi Thar Township,News and Press Release,PIN,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",16 Dec 2022,"The global pandemic, recession, and political turmoil have impacted the daily lives of the people of Myanmar. To alleviate the suffering of people in Myanmar, Call Me Today, a consortium partner of the Aye Chan Thaw Ein (ACTE) project, has provided psychosocial phone counselling to those most affected: migrant workers in Shwe Pyi Thar township, Yangon region. As part of the project, Call Me Today helped 1,814 individuals via phone counselling between 2020 and 2022, of which 90% were female workers., Psychosocial counselling is a critical need and helps the health and well-being of individuals to identify their problems and find solutions. To overcome these challenges, Call Me Today has provided phone line networks and local facilitators to reach out to individuals in Shwe Pyi Thar township. Call Me Today's practitioners use different phone operators in Myanmar to connect with individuals, mostly dismissed and migrant workers, to provide a therapeutic relationship and build trust between clients and practitioners., In 2020, Call Me Today also conducted group counselling sessions at ACTE Worker Centres. In total, 53 group counselling sessions assisted 535 individuals. Thaw Nadi Myint Oo, a project coordinator with Call Me Today, shares their challenges to implementing the phone line counselling, ""throughout these three years project, 2022 has been the most challenging for us to provide the psychosocial phone counselling service, because of the safety and security concerns in the region. These conditions deter practitioners from going to the field for clinical sessions and make it hard to build a therapeutic relationship and trust over phone lines. However, we successfully reached our clients' needs by introducing services to partners in Shwe Pyi Thar and via facilitators who conducted group discussions about the services with residents before their sessions, and our practitioners engaged with the clients through phone lines directly after."", Call Me Today's practitioners played a vital role in this contribution as they reached out to each and every individual using phoneline to build therapeutic relationships, provided psychoeducation and psychosocial support, and made referrals to the necessary third-party organisations based on their clients' needs. Solely during 2022, Call Me Today has provided 416 clients with over 501 sessions. 92% of the total beneficiaries are females, and 68% of beneficiaries are migrant workers. Even though the remaining 32% are not migrants, they are blue-collar workers residing in the Shwe Pyi Thar township., Thaw adds, ""in times of crisis, there were migrants in Shwe Pyi Thar township who asked for financial aid as their priority. They believe having financial support can reduce their anxiety. Although it is undeniable that food security and job safety contribute to upholding balanced mental well-being, having stable mental well-being and being able to control mental distress are as crucial as food and job security in solving family-related problems."", Call Me Today believes improving mental well-being and providing necessary psychoeducation can stabilise the beneficiary's state of mind and motivate them to solve their problems themselves in their daily life. People sometimes need a counsellor to encourage their insecurities and to listen to their issues at a foundational level. Call Me Today has provided psychosocial support and psychoeducation to migrants of Shwe Pyi Thar in times of conflict to help their mental state., Simple coping techniques such as belly breathing exercises, filtering controllable and uncontrollable issues, gratitude practices, psychoeducation on understanding the nature of stress and anxiety, and setting boundaries are provided via telephone during the session as additional coping methods for beneficiaries' future., The psychosocial support and psychoeducation by Call Me Today show positive results for beneficiaries. Mi Mi* shares her attitudes to Call Me Today and Aye Chan Thaw Ein project, ""this counselling session helps me relieve stress and anxiety because of the current situation in the country and financial problems which felt like ""a burden on my shoulder"". After receiving counselling from Call Me Today and opening up about my problems, I can release tension from my shoulders and feel more relaxed and refreshed."", Daw Shwe Yee* explains, ""I own a small business in Shwe Pyi Thar township. I felt depressed because of skyrocketing prices. After receiving a counselling session and the physical exercises, I have a calmer state of mind and gained positive mindfulness and motivation. Also, I practice physical exercises at home and/or shop to relieve my stress as much as possible. Thanks to Call Me Today for providing me psychosocial support and bringing positive vibes to carry on my life with my children."", Call Me Today believes that the beneficiaries will remember and utilise the knowledge and tools related to psychoeducation during the session. Based on this project, beneficiaries are in a better position after their sessions and know how to care for their mental well-being, this work is supported through financial support by the Livelihoods and Food Security Fund (LIFT). Call Me Today strives to be within reach for everyone in Myanmar via online platforms, phone, and text, and it has been providing counselling and psychosocial support for many years since 2018., *The names of certain individuals have been changed for their protection., Author: Aye Pyae Sone, Communication officer for Myanmar",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/protecting-mental-well-being-migrant-workers-shwe-pyi-thar-township

"Undeniable: War crimes, crimes against humanity and 30 years of villagers’ testimonies in rural Southeast Burma",Analysis,KHRG,"Education
Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",13 Dec 2022,"Military abuse, exploitation and conflict have marked villagers’ lives in Southeast Burma since the country’s independence in 1948. Many villagers have suffered through repeated waves of intense violence and oppression as the Burma military attempted to bring the different ethnic areas under its control and wipe out ethnic armed resistance. Some villagers have experienced decades of displacement due to armed conflict and military operations., During the period of direct military rule, the Burma military’s counter-insurgency operations involved direct attacks on civilians, including extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, forced displacements, looting and extortion, sexual violence, and forced labour, amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity., This report draws on the life stories and testimonies of villagers who not only are living amidst the current waves of violence and abuse, but are survivors of the Burma military’s longstanding campaigns to eradicate all forms of opposition. In bringing together documentation of past and present abuses, this report helps provide an understanding of the impact of decades of state violence and military impunity on the lives of rural villagers in Karen State. Interwoven with these villagers’ stories is the wider history of atrocity crimes and rights violations documented by KHRG over the past 30 years. In revisiting KHRG’s past documentation, this report also shows the strength of local actors and local communities who have been working together to ensure that international stakeholders have the necessary evidence to take action against Burma’s oppressive military regime, despite the international community’s systematic inaction., In showing that these abuses and these struggles are not new, KHRG hopes that this report will spark a change in the way in which human rights violations are addressed on the larger international level. The repeated failures of the international community to respond to the military regime’s violence against ethnic minorities in Burma over more than half a century should be proof enough that a shift in approach is required. This report thus serves as an invitation to listen to the villagers, whose voices are presented here, and to work with them in building a new way forward.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/undeniable-war-crimes-crimes-against-humanity-and-30-years-villagers-testimonies-rural-southeast-burma

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in Myanmar: Findings from the Myanmar Household Welfare Survey 2021-2022,Assessment,IFPRI,Food and Nutrition,9 Dec 2022,"In this research note, we provide an overview of the state of food security and nutrition in Myanmar using a recently collected household dataset. We examine food security using a household hunger scale and a food consumption score. To examine the state of nutrition, we examine the diet quality of individuals across Myanmar for three separate but important sections of population: (1) adults (18+ years), (2) women of reproductive age (15-49 years), and (3) children (6-23 and 6-59 months). We explore these indicators using three rounds of the Myanmar Household Welfare Survey (MHWS) collected over the phone in the first three quarters of 2022 – hereafter Q1, Q2 and Q3 – among over 12,000 households in 310 townships of Myanmar. MWHS is a nationally, urban/rural and state/region representative phone survey (MAPSA 2022a). We use standard food security and diet diversity measures for each of the three subpopulations to examine trends over the three rounds as well as explore heterogeneity with respect to gender, location of residence, and asset and income-based welfare indicators. We also look at disaggregated consumption of the different food groups that constitute the diet diversity measures to investigate the change in the consumption pattern of individuals. Finally, we use regression analysis to look at predictors of food insecurity and inadequate diet diversity, including household wealth and income, self-reported shocks, food prices, and household characteristics.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/state-food-security-and-nutrition-myanmar-findings-myanmar-household-welfare-survey-2021-2022

Displacement due to active armed clashes, arson and airstrikes continue.
Humanitarian access has been challenging, particularly in Sagaing Region where the needs are most acute. Conflict is expected to escalate in the winter months, leaving civilians increasingly at risk of attacks., In Rakhine and Chin (South) States, clashes, indiscriminate shelling and landmine explosions were reported. Food shortages and limited humanitarian support due to movement restrictions have affected communities, particularly in Buthidaung, Maungdaw, Rathedaung, Mrauk-U, Minbya, Myebon, Kyauktaw and Pauktaw. The situation in Rakhine State has been generally calm albeit tense following the announcement of an informal ceasefire agreement between the Tatmadaw and the Arakan Army (AA) in late November. Since then, returns by displaced families to their places of origin have begun taking place. While humanitarian access remains challenging, the opening of waterways and roads has enabled the movement of much-needed goods, resulting in a decrease in the cost of basic commodities., In Kachin and Shan (North), humanitarian access across Kachin and Shan (North) States is limited, particularly in active conflict areas. Movement restrictions continue to be reported due to the heightened risk of forced recruitment, robbery, physical assault and arbitrary arrest particularly in the evenings., In the South-East, the security situation is precarious and has affected the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Indiscriminate shelling, arrests and destruction of civilian property continues. Insufficient access to food, water, healthcare and core relief items (CRIs) are among the main concerns cited by IDP families.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-emergency-update-5-december-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",6 Dec 2022,"HIGHLIGHTS, Myanmar continues to experience a severe - and worsening - humanitarian and human rights crisis. Conflict and violence have escalated across the country, impacting children and their families and displacing more than 1.4 million people. The ongoing political crisis has been coupled with economic challenges, increasing people's vulnerability. An estimated 17.6 million people, including 5.6 million children, are in need of humanitarian assistance., Access of children and their families to such essential services as health care, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and education is severely constrained. These interrelated challenges are threatening children's survival, development and well-being., UNICEF’s humanitarian strategy focuses on working with communities, local and international partners and with all stakeholders to deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance and ensure critical services reach children in need., UNICEF requires US$169.6 million to respond to the mult-isectoral humanitarian needs of children in Myanmar., HUMANITARIAN SITUATION AND NEEDS, Children and their families continue to suffer due to widespread and deepening conflict in Myanmar. The situation further deteriorated in 2022, with increased fighting taking place nationwide between the Myanmar Armed Forces, ethnic armed organizations and more than 600 local defence groups. Around 17.6 million people - almost one third of the population - are in need of humanitarian assistance. The number of children and their families displaced by the conflict has increased by 60 per cent since December 2021 to more than 1.4 million people, including the 330,400 who had been living in protracted displacement even prior to the coup that took place in February 2021. Communities in the Sagaing region are the hardest hit, with nearly 612,400 people displaced as of October 2022. The resurgence of fighting in Rakhine State between government armed forces and a large ethnic armed organization has imperilled the situation of the nearly 220,000 people living in protracted displacement there., There are also extremely vulnerable non-displaced people, including 417,000 stateless Rohingyas, along with communities affected by conflict, insecurity and rising poverty in rural areas and cities. Cross-border movements are fluid and bidirectional. Those who fled to Thailand and then returned to Myanmar remain displaced within the country because they have not returned to places of origin., Grave violations of child rights have increased in 2022 compared with 2021: for example, the number of children killed and maimed between January and September 2022 more than doubled compared with 2021, largely due to indiscriminate use of heavy weapons, airstrikes and explosive ordnance. There has also been an eightfold increase in the number of abductions in 2022. Attacks on schools and hospitals have continued at alarming levels, while recruitment and use of children by all armed actors remains of serious concern. Millions of children and adolescents are deprived of the right to education because their safe access to education has been disrupted., The ongoing conflict has undermined the delivery of child health services, including routine immunization and the response to severe wasting. This has lead to a regression in child health outcomes in the country. The disruption in child immunization services also creates longer-term risks of increased disease prevalence., Access of conflict-affected populations to services and delivery of humanitarian assistance has been further constrained by restrictions imposed on movement of both people and goods. Camp closures and forced return and relocation remain key protection concerns for displaced people. The safety and protection of humanitarian and front-line workers has also become a serious concern, as they are increasingly targeted by parties to the conflict and subject to arbitrary arrests and detentions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/humanitarian-action-children-2023-myanmar

Response figures are based on self-reporting by organizations to clusters. The next humanitarian update will be issued at the end of December 2022., HIGHLIGHTS & KEY MESSAGES, More than 1.4 million people are displaced across the country, of whom more than 1.1 million were displaced since the 2021 military takeover., Armed clashes, compounded by tight security, access restrictions, and threats against aid workers, continue to hamper humanitarian operations across Myanmar., Humanitarians are hoping that an informal ceasefire agreement between the Arakan Army (AA) and the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) may create space for the delivery of much-needed assistance in Rakhine and southern Chin where access has been restricted since September. The situation is being closely monitored., Humanitarians are deeply concerned about the newly passed NGO registration law and partners are currently investigating the potential impact on the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance., Premature return of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from past and present conflicts in Rakhine, Chin and southern Shan states remains a major protection concern amid ongoing insecurity and continued fighting. It is critical that returns are done safely and voluntarily, in line with international principles., Inflation in commodity prices, including for food and fuel, is deepening the socio-economic stress on communities, forcing them to adopt negative coping mechanisms., The 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remains drastically underfunded as the end of 2022 is approaching. As of 30 November, it is only 28 per cent funded, leaving a gap of US$597 million (FTS).

People internally displaced due to conflict prior to February 2021, mainly in Rakhine, Kachin, Chin, and Shan, 31K
Civilian properties estimated to have been burnt or destroyed since February 2021., *Displacement figures fluctuate during any given month. These figures represent the number of people currently displaced. Cumulative numbers for returns and displacement are not always available., SITUATION OVERVIEW, The humanitarian situation continues to be dominated by hostilities and increasing economic stress for millions of people. Frequent, indiscriminate attacks, including airstrikes and artillery fire in civilian areas have caused casualties and spread fear. Displacement also continues to rise despite some reported returns. According to the latest UN figures, the estimated number of new IDPs since the military takeover has passed 1.1 million, bringing the total number of IDPs across the country to almost 1.4 million. More than 49,400 people remain in neighbouring countries after fleeing since the takeover., Nearly 31,000 civilian properties, including houses, churches, monasteries, and schools are estimated to have been destroyed although figures are difficult to verify. The level of destruction of civilian property, particularly of homes, combined with the deteriorating security situation and explosive ordnance risks are delaying returns and prolonging people’s displacement., Suffering is being compounded by heavy restrictions on humanitarian access, including cumbersome bureaucratic processes and systematic blocks on access approvals, that continue to delay the delivery of critical and lifesaving assistance to affected people. Humanitarian actors, including the UN, INGOs, and local partners, continue responding to both pre-existing and emerging needs wherever they can. Despite the constrained operating environment and limited funding (less than 30 per cent), nearly 3.9 million people across Myanmar had received assistance by the end of September. Please see the full Quarter 3 dashboard here., Local partners are now the backbone of the response and Quarter 3 saw a further increase in the number of organizations coordinating their response through the cluster system from 177 in Quarter 2 to 219 - a direct result of a scale-up in cluster coordination efforts, with a particular focus on hard-to-reach areas. Nevertheless, response numbers are based on voluntary reporting by partners to clusters and there is likely to be significant underreporting by local organizations. As 2022 is nearing an end, this year’s HRP is only 28 per cent funded, which amounts to only $230 million out of a total of $826 million required.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-update-no-24-3-december-2022
Myanmar: UN Human Rights Chief alarmed at death sentences by secretive military courts,News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,2 Dec 2022,"GENEVA (2 December 2022) – UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk on Friday expressed shock that more than 130 people have now been sentenced to death by military courts behind closed-doors in Myanmar since the military launched a coup last year, following fresh convictions this week., At least seven university students were sentenced to death by a military court on 30 November. There are reports of as many as four additional death sentences being issued against youth activists yesterday. The UN Human Rights Office is seeking clarification of those sentences., “The military continues to hold proceedings in secretive courts in violation of basic principles of fair trial and contrary to core judicial guarantees of independence and impartiality,” Türk said, calling for the suspension of all executions and a return to a moratorium on death penalty., “Military courts have consistently failed to uphold any degree of transparency contrary to the most basic due process or fair trial guarantees.”, In July, the military carried out four executions, the first in approximately 30 years. A former lawmaker, a democracy activist, and two others were executed despite calls from the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the international community to desist., Close to 1,700 detainees of the nearly 16,500 who have been arrested for opposing the military’s coup have been tried and convicted in secret by ad hoc tribunals, sometimes lasting just minutes. None have been acquitted, and often they have not had access to lawyers or their families., The latest convictions would bring the total number of individuals sentenced to capital punishment to 139 individuals since 1 February 2021., The actions of the military are not in keeping with the ASEAN 5-point consensus that the South-East Asia nations have just re-committed to uphold at the ASEAN summit in November, Türk said., “By resorting to use death sentences as a political tool to crush opposition, the military confirms its disdain for the efforts by ASEAN and the international community at large to end violence and create the conditions for a political dialogue to lead Myanmar out of a human rights crisis created by the military,” the UN Human Rights Chief added., For more information and media requests, please contact:, In Geneva, Ravina Shamdasani - + 41 22 917 9169 / ravina.shamdasani@un.org or

"Myanmar: Over 50,000 exposed to forced evictions and housing destruction, say UN experts",News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",2 Dec 2022,"GENEVA (2 December 2022) - The Myanmar Military is forcibly evicting over 50,000 people from informal settlements and systematically destroying homes in a fundamental violation of core human rights obligations, UN experts said today., More than 40,000 residents living in informal settlements in Mingaladon, a northern township of Yangon, have received eviction notices last month. Many were given only a few days to dismantle their homes, without provision of any alternative housing or land. Most residents have lived for decades in an industrial zone containing a mixture of industrial enterprises, informal settlements and vacant land controlled by the Myanmar Military., Additional residents moved to the area after being displaced by Cyclone Nargis in 2008, or were forcibly displaced there as a result of violent military attacks on civilian villages in Rakhine State, the experts said., After receiving eviction notices, some residents dismantled their homes in an attempt to secure their belongings and construction materials. However, most residents have so far chosen to remain due to a lack of alternative or decided to flee their homes. Out of desperation, two residents reportedly committed suicide., ""Forced evictions from Mingaladon are only part of the story. Violent arbitrary housing demolitions continue across the country,"" the experts said., On 19 November, 150 homes were bulldozed in Ward 3 of Yangon's Mayangone township, rendering affected residents homeless. The eviction was carried out by the State Administration Council and civilians armed with sticks and knives. The residents were reportedly given only 30 minutes to remove their belongings, and are temporarily sheltering in monasteries or with friends., In Myanmar's second largest city of Mandalay, over 5,000 households in Chan Mya Thazi Township were evicted overnight on 21 November. Earlier the Military demolished several houses with bulldozers in Zee Oat village in the same town. In addition, 200 shops and apartments on the station road of Mandalay's Pyin Oo Lwin township were ordered to be removed by 25 November, despite having local approval., According to the experts, not only those living in informal settlements in Myanmar's cities were subjected to forced evictions and housing demolitions. ""Homes continued to be systematically destroyed, bombed and burned down in orchestrated attacks on villages by the Myanmar security forces and junta-backed militias,"" they said., Since the military coup on 1 February 2021, more than 38,000 houses have been destroyed or burned down, leading to widespread displacement of over 1.1 million people. Recently, on 23 November, 95 of 130 houses were burned down in the Kha War Thei village in Kyunhla Township, when the Myanmar military set fire to the settlement. The experts said these incidents follow a pattern of widespread burning of Rohingya villages perpetrated by the Myanmar Military in 2017 during genocidal attacks against the Rohingya., ""The policies of scorched earth in Myanmar are widespread and follow a systematic pattern,"" the experts said., In a recent report to the UN General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing suggested that such arbitrary destruction of housing, displacing thousands into homelessness, should be recognised as domicide, a crime under international law., ""Forced evictions and mass burning of homes are gross violations of human rights. The junta must immediately stop the systematic destruction, burning and bulldozing of civilian homes,"" the UN experts said., ""Depending on the context, systematic housing destruction and displacement can be prosecuted either as a war crime, a crime against humanity, or both. It is the responsibility of the international community to ensure that those responsible for such crimes face international justice,"" they said., ENDS, The experts: Mr. Balakrishnan Rajagopal, assumed his function as Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing on 1 May 2020. He is Professor of Law and Development at the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Mr. Thomas Andrews, is the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar. He is a Senior Human Rights Fellow at Yale University Law School and an Associate of Harvard University's Asia Center., The Special Rapporteurs are part of what are known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. The Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN human rights system, is the general name for the Council's independent investigative and monitoring mechanisms that deal with specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world. Special Procedures experts work on a voluntary basis; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their work.

Healthcare not stigma,News and Press Release,UNOPS,HIV/Aids,2 Dec 2022,"Far too many of Myanmar’s women and girls live with HIV. We’re helping them fight discrimination., Today, Myanmar has one of Asia's highest HIV prevalence rates with an estimated 270,000 people living with the disease. Women and girls over the age of 15 account for 37 per cent of those rates, with young women being twice as likely to get infected compared to young men – particularly if they use drugs or work in the sex trade., “Women who use drugs face daily barriers in the attainment of basic health and safety rights while experiencing high rates of imprisonment, stigma, discrimination, [and] sexual and gender-based violence,” said one staff member of the Asian Harm Reduction Network (AHRN)., The sharing of syringes remains the leading cause of HIV transmission. The growing use of drugs has become a major concern due to its link with high-risk sexual and injection behaviours. The combination of drug use and sex work has created a group of women particularly vulnerable to HIV and other health issues., Yet, this is a group that stays hidden in society. Forced there by stigma., It means that women who use drugs and female sex workers are confronted by overwhelming barriers to the health services they so urgently need. The few women who do overcome the obstacles are typically served by harm reduction services designed for men – simply because not much is yet known about the gendered dimensions of the issue., Acting for women, the Access to Health Fund is working with AHRN to create safe and accessible harm reduction services in Myanmar’s Kachin and Shan States – areas where the use of drugs is especially high. These women-friendly services bring together trained peers with shared experiences as well as female outreach workers to provide spaces where women can communicate more openly about their lives and health issues – free from fear and humiliation., In order to reach greater numbers from this historically marginalized group, AHRN organized women-led outreach work at brothels, shooting galleries and other places where women are likely to use drugs. Under the umbrella of its drug use and health consequences programme, the network set up special areas with dedicated hours at their drop-in centres. These areas exclusively serve women looking to access health information and treatment services for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.

Female counsellors, outreach workers and youth peers also offer psychosocial support., Reaching more women in need, Between the first half of 2021 and the same period in 2022, the number of women reached by AHRN's harm reduction services increased from around 950 to almost 1,700.

Myanmar: UN Human Rights Office deeply concerned by new NGO law,News and Press Release,OHCHR,Safety and Security,28 Nov 2022,"BANGKOK (28 November 2022) – The UN Human Rights Office for South-East Asia (OHCHR) is deeply concerned about the potential negative impact on civic space and human rights of new rules regulating the registration of non-profit organizations in Myanmar., On 28 October, the military’s so-called State Administration Council unilaterally imposed a text making registration compulsory for both national and international non-governmental organizations and associations. In purportedly repealing the 2014 Association Registration Law, these new rules introduce criminal penalties for organizations who fail to comply with punishments up to five years of imprisonment., Since the attempted coup in February 2021 and in pursuance of their “four-cuts” strategy, the military has put in place numerous measures, including internet shutdowns in over 20 townships, eroding civic space and preventing the exercise of fundamental rights and freedom, such as freedoms of expression and association., The military has used the national legal framework and the judiciary to crush any opposition and these new provisions add to the legal arsenal at their disposal to exert authoritarian control over Myanmar., “Civic space has been decimated in the country already due to the military’s actions, particularly its systematic harassment, arrest, and prosecution of anyone who opposed their coup,” said James Rodehaver, Chief of the OHCHR Myanmar Team., “These new rules could greatly diminish what operational space is left for civic organizations to deliver essential goods and services to a population that is struggling to survive.”, In the context of ongoing fighting throughout the country, military decisions and actions have severely restricted humanitarian access limiting efforts to reach some of the estimated 1.4 million internally displaced people and millions of others affected by crisis with life-saving humanitarian aid., Local civil society and grassroot organizations have played an increasingly crucial role in the provision of humanitarian assistance to those in need, particularly to food, health care, shelter, safe drinking water, and sanitation facilities., Registration obligations stemming from this new military text may jeopardize all this and expose over a million people, including children and the elderly, to life-threatening risks, said Rodehaver., “These new requirements and penalties are likely to make it more difficult for legitimate, dedicated civil society groups to get desperately needed support to those who need it most,” Rodehaver said., “The military has an obligation to the people of Myanmar to facilitate the work of civil society and to ensure unimpeded access to communities in desperate need of assistance, not target them through bureaucratic harassment or threaten them with prosecution.”, The UN Human Rights Office calls on the military to meet their obligations under international human rights law and international humanitarian law, particularly to enhance protection of civilians, release political prisoners, and restore a political system representative of the will of the people of Myanmar., ENDS, For more information and media requests, please contact: in Bangkok, Wannaporn Samutassadong (+66 65 986 0810 /wannaporn.samutassadong@un.org).",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-un-human-rights-office-deeply-concerned-new-ngo-law

It began its operations in 1920 as a branch of the Indian Red Cross. After Burma formally separated from India in 1937, the Society obtained official national status and was admitted to the IFRC in 1946. It is the oldest humanitarian organization in Myanmar. The National Society counts 692 staff and 40,000 volunteers. It operates through 330 township branches, 17 supervisory committees (states, regions and Naypyitaw Union Territory), and has branches in universities, colleges, and sub-branches at town, ward, village tract and schools across the country., The role of the National Society – to serve independently and voluntarily while acting as the auxiliary of the state in the humanitarian field, in accordance with the Red Cross Red Crescent Fundamental Principles – is enshrined in the Myanmar Red Cross Society Law 2015., The Myanmar Red Cross Society Strategic Plan (2021-2025) sets the following three goals:, Build healthier and safer communities, reduce their vulnerabilities and strengthen their resilience, Promote understanding and respect for the Red Cross Principles, Humanitarian Values, and International Humanitarian Law as a means to promoting social cohesion and non-violence, Strengthen understanding of the Myanmar Red Cross’s auxiliary role among the humanitarian sector by developing a strong, well-functioning and resourceful National Society, According to its Strategic Plan, 2021–2025, with partner support, the Myanmar Red Cross aims to equip Red Cross volunteers, national headquarters and state, regional and township branches with the technical, financial and material resources “to be a well-functioning National Society with the capacity of providing humanitarian services to the most vulnerable people in Myanmar and beyond.”, The National Society plans to extend its traditional emergency response activities – including the delivery of ambulance and first aid services, primary health care, water, sanitation and hygiene services, psychosocial support and protection – while also developing its preparedness through disaster risk reduction, anticipatory action and resilience building., To support these ambitions, the National Society plans to enhance its institutional capacity through branch development and decentralization, volunteer and youth management and capacity building, resource mobilization and human resource management, and partnership frameworks., IFRC NETWORK ACTION IN 2023, Joint situational analysis, In 2023, the humanitarian situation in Myanmar will continue to be dominated by the ongoing complex emergency. This protracted crisis is the result of longstanding violence between state forces and ethnic armed organizations in border regions of the country; the situation deteriorated further following a military intervention on 1 February 2021. Moreover, the impacts of COVID-19 continue to slow socio-economic recovery in the country., Since February 2021, there has been a marked increase in civil unrest and political instability in Myanmar. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), there are currently 12 ongoing non-international armed conflicts in the country., As a result, insecurity is rising throughout the country, including in major urban centres including Yangon. Food insecurity, limited protection and the inability to access basic services – including mental health and psychosocial support, education and shelter – are expected to continue to be serious humanitarian concerns for 2023., There are currently more than 1.2 million displaced people in Myanmar – the majority of whom were displaced following the military intervention in February 2021. There are also risks that significantly more people will be internally displaced in the near future, as authorities in Myanmar announced a plan to begin the repatriation of Muslims from Bangladesh. Following the outbreak of ethnic violence in Rakhine State in 2017, some 919,000 Muslims fled to Bangladesh., Elevated and rising levels of displacement, due to increased levels of violence, present a major humanitarian challenge to displaced people and the communities that host them., The politicization of humanitarian aid has led to operational challenges for humanitarian organizations including the Myanmar Red Cross and the IFRC network. Humanitarian organizations continue to experience restricted access to affected people, which has a significant impact on humanitarian logistics. Financial restrictions, including challenges in accessing currency, changing bank policies and authority-imposed bureaucratic bottlenecks, have negatively affected the scope of resources available for humanitarian programming and threatened the National Society’s financial sustainability., Current financial policies have also led to widespread inflation, which continues to increase humanitarian needs across the country. The depreciation of the local currency and the increase in the official foreign exchange rate are likely to continue to affect the National Society’s capacity to plan and implement programmes, while also negatively affecting the ability of humanitarian organizations to deliver aid more broadly., Accessing health care in Myanmar is difficult, as many health care workers have been participating in civil disobedience activities. Moreover, there is an ongoing lack of medicines and other essential supplies. For internally displaced people, the lack of access to health care is particularly grave as most are unable to access sexual and reproductive services and maternal and child health services. Many are also unable to seek treatment for communicable and non-communicable diseases and do not have access to safe drinking water or sanitation facilities. Additionally, most internally displaced people have unmet needs for mental health and psychosocial support., While COVID-19 appears to be under control in the country, UNICEF reported that one million children have not been immunized against communicable diseases in Myanmar since 2021. Severe disruptions to the Expanded Programme on Immunization and the lack of access to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities are putting children and whole communities at severe risk of infectious and vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks. Internally displaced people are particularly at risk., Access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities remains inadequate in Myanmar. UN data indicates that 73.8 per cent of the urban population and 52.1 per cent of the rural population use safely managed drinking water. Moreover, according to UN data, only 53.4 per cent of the urban population and 64 per cent of the rural population have access to safely managed sanitation., Myanmar is also a multi-hazard country and is prone to several hydrometeorological and geophysical hazards such as floods, landslides, cyclones, droughts and earthquakes., Despite the challenging context, the Myanmar Red Cross will prioritize life-saving actions through a coherent and coordinated set of interventions in 2023 to respond to the increasing humanitarian needs across the country.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-2023-ifrc-network-country-plan-maamm002
Ending unmet need for family planning in a world of 8 billion: The innovations enabling access for all,News and Press Release,UNFPA,"Gender
Health",29 Nov 2022,"YANGON, Myanmar/PORTEL, Brazil – Access to contraceptives and family planning has long been a complicated matter. But the COVID-19 pandemic made matters worse., According to UNFPA research, disruptions in access to family planning services and supplies led 12 million women in 115 countries to lose access to birth control – and to as many as 1.4 million unplanned pregnancies., For many, the coronavirus crisis reinforced the need for innovative solutions to the global problem of unmet need for modern family planning. Around the world, UNFPA met this urgent necessity with invention. Below, check out two new technological tools helping to accelerate UNFPA’s progress towards achieving universal family planning – for all 8 billion people now officially on the planet., Saúde das Manas, Even before the COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread disruptions to the provision of sexual and reproductive health services, some communities had little to no access to regular care., In fact, visits from gynecologists had been so rare in some communities of Brazil’s Pará state that one resident said many women don’t know what they are. “It was only in 2011 that I learned that gynecologists existed,” Leiliana Pereira told UNFPA., This could change, however, following the introduction of a new telemedical service launched in August 2020 by UNFPA and the Pará Council of Municipal Health Departments called Saúde das Manas, or Sisters’ Health., Sisters’ Health connects women and girls in hard-to-reach areas with telemedical sexual and reproductive health care, enabling access to services like prenatal consultations, gynecological cancer screenings and family planning. The project now operates across 13 municipalities in Pará – a state encompassed by Brazil’s Amazon region, which has struggled to reduce its maternal mortality rate., In and around Portel, a city in Pará, taboos surrounding family planning run deep and misinformation is hard to squash. Ms. Pereira, who lives in Portel, said many in her community, especially those in the countryside, lack adequate information about contraceptives. The mother-of-five was 17 when she had her first child. ""It was not planned – it happened,"" she said., Earlier this year, she went for an appointment with a gynecologist at one of Saudé das Manas’ outposts in Portel with the objective of restarting use of contraceptives. Seated next to telemedicina nurse Stephanie Monteiro in her hometown, Ms. Pereira video chatted with a physician., She is one of nearly 14,000 women that Saúde das Manas has reached. And with the project’s organizers exploring the possibility of expansion, she will not be the last., “I hope that this continues, not only for me but for all women who need a doctor,” Ms. Pereira said. “The gynecologist is the women's doctor because they know our needs.”, Baykin 2, Similar concerns were seen in Thura’s community in Myanmar. “There is social stigma existing in our community to speak about sexual and reproductive health, especially concerning adolescents and youth. People are too shy to talk about it,” says the 15-year-old girl., And like in Brazil, taboos were just one obstacle getting in the way of access to sexual and reproductive health information. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, UNFPA collaborated with partners to facilitate in-person awareness sessions on such issues. But after the virus began its global spread and Myanmar’s political instability led to restrictions on young people’s movements, these conversations were forced to migrate to a safer space – online., Enter the Baykin 2 app: a virtual learning platform designed to introduce young people in Myanmar to critical information on sexual and reproductive health and rights, gender equality, gender-based violence and other subjects., “For some young people, they feel comfortable and safe via this virtual platform and raise their issues openly for our support. We are so happy to see their interest and active participation going forward,” says Marie Stope Myanmar Programme Coordinator Aung Pike Tun., The Baykin 2 app was designed to introduce adolescents and young people in Myanmar to key topics on sexual and reproductive health, gender equality and gender-based violence, among other topics. Games and visuals help adolescents learn about their bodies and rights., Since its official launch in June 2022, Baykin 2’s user base has significantly expanded, according to UNFPA Myanmar. Half of its users are 10-24 years old; meanwhile some parents have created accounts for their children., Baykin’s English translation is ""being safe"", which matches the ultimate goal of the app – to help young people gain the knowledge they need to exercise their rights and avoid the risk of unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion, gender-based violence and other life threatening complications., “Sexual and reproductive health information saves the lives and future of young people,” says 23-year-old Mya Kalyar Kyaw. “This is not a luxury. This is our fundamental right.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/ending-unmet-need-family-planning-world-8-billion-innovations-enabling-access-all

High intensity conflict persisted, particularly in the Northwest and Southeast. In Rakhine, the renewed fighting between the Arakan Army and Myanmar Armed Forces further intensified over the reporting period with severe impact on humanitarian access to people in need. As a result, an additional 240,000 people fled their homes nationwide during the quarter. This took the number of IDPs displaced since 1 February 2021 beyond 1 million and the total number of people displaced close to 1.4 million.
Displaced people continue to experience high to extreme levels of vulnerability. At the same time, the combined economic, humanitarian, human rights and political crises further eroded the resilience of other crisis-affected people., The humanitarian operational space continued to shrink amidst ongoing conflict, insecurity, and other bureaucratic access constraints.
The safety of humanitarians and frontline workers is increasingly under threat. Against this backdrop, humanitarian partners continue to explore alternative approaches to deliver desperately needed assistance. Local partners are now the backbone of the response and Q3 saw a further increase in the number of organizations coordinating their response through the cluster system from 177 in Q2 to 219 - the direct result of a scale-up in cluster coordination efforts, with a particular focus on hard-to-reach areas.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-response-plan-2022-quarter-three-dashboard-jan-sep-2022

Protection and Human Rights",25 Nov 2022,"“UNITE! Activism to End Violence against Women and Girls”, As we mark the launch of the Commemoration of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, women and girls in Myanmar are sounding a loud alarm over their heightened vulnerability, stressing that the weight of gender-based violence, combined with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing conflict, are eroding their sense of hope and resilience., Gender-based violence (GBV) is a gross violation of human rights and its roots are entrenched in social norms in all countries. Globally, an estimated one in every three women experience physical or sexual abuse in her lifetime, and one in every four adolescent girls aged 15–19 years, has been abused by an intimate partner or husband. At its worst, gender-based violence can result in death, like in situations where a woman or girl is murdered by family members for bringing dishonour upon the family name or prestige (honour killing). Survivors of gender-based violence suffer short and long-term consequences to their physical and mental health., The root causes of gender-based violence are embedded in gender-inequality and an unequal power balance between women and men., The Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey (2015-2016) reported that 17 percent of ever married women aged between 15 and 49 have experienced some forms of intimate partner violence in their lifetime, of which 37 percent are survivors of physical injuries. Among women who have ever experienced sexual violence, 7 out of 10 have never sought help nor told anyone. However, evidence show that gender-based violence is often under-reported and intensifies during times of crisis when resources are limited, especially against women and girls., The ongoing political, socioeconomic and protection crisis in Myanmar is fuelling the risk of gender-based violence and increasing humanitarian needs. In this very difficult situation, all women and girls are entitled to unconditional protection and enjoyment of their rights without any form of discrimination., Through the United Nations’ work in other crisis situations, we know that women, children, and persons with disabilities, are particularly vulnerable as they are exposed to significant risks of violence. Working with civil society organisations, the United Nations in Myanmar is promoting the collection of sex, age and disability disaggregated data to ensure holistic and responsive interventions are delivered on time. Currently, over 1.3 million people, including those with disabilities, have been displaced, the majority of which are women and children. Factors such as high exposure to gender-based violence, poverty, displacement, restrictions on movement, and limited access to healthcare, including sexual and reproductive services, are rendering women and girls increasingly vulnerable to many other risks., The United Nations continues to prioritise delivering principled humanitarian assistance to all affected communities, including internally-displaced people, migrants, the LGBTIQA+ community, women and girls with disability, people living with HIV and AIDS and those affected by COVID-19., The culture of silence among survivors of violence must be broken in Myanmar to ensure that survivors report cases to local authorities, have access to gender-friendly justice, healthcare, social protection and Mental Health and Psychosocial services., We call on all humanitarian actors to listen to survivors, and to ensure that essential services, including Women and Girls’ Centers and Safe Houses and specialized services such as case management, receive adequate funds to continue and scale up., This can only be achieved in close partnership with women’s civil society organizations, community-based organizations, national and international NGOs and donors in Myanmar and donors. Collaborating with, and sustaining funding for women’s organizations and civil society organisations (CSOs), who are at the forefront of responding, and delivering life-saving gender-based violence services at grassroots level, is critical. Many of the Organisations that provide first line of life-saving GBV services are local CSOs. Unfortunately the recently announced Organisation Registration Law will not only negatively impact on their ability to provide such services but may even threaten their very existence., In Myanmar, the United Nations remains firmly committed to promoting building community-based prevention systems through intensified awareness-raising and social behaviour change programmes, engaging men and boys, community leaders and other local actors., Together, we re-affirm our strong commitment to stay and deliver life-saving services that address the urgent needs of women and girls. On the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, we call on all stakeholders and agents of change to break the silence to end violence against women and girls, and ensure that all survivors can have access to life-saving services., Let’s All UNITE and ACT to End Violence against Women and Girls Now!, Lesly Lotha

Myanmar Junta Ramps Up Landmine Use,News and Press Release,HRW,Mine Action,20 Nov 2022,"Banned Weapons Kill, Maim Civilians for Decades, Shayna Bauchner
Researcher, Asia Division, “I lost my leg and my cow.”, Aoung Gya Thowai Tanchangya, 22, was grazing his cattle along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border on September 16. “Sometimes our cattle cross into Myanmar so we have to go bring them back,” he said. “I didn’t realize there could be mines planted. When I stepped onto the mine, it exploded. I lost consciousness. When I woke up, I saw that my left leg was gone. I still feel pain.”, In 2022, 25 years since the international Mine Ban Treaty was adopted, only two countries actively use antipersonnel landmines: Russia and Myanmar. Myanmar’s forces have used landmines since 1999, but new use by the junta has surged since the February 2021 coup, according to the Landmine Monitor Report 2022, released last week., The report analyzed photographs of hundreds of landmines manufactured by the junta and planted across the country., From February 2021 to September 2022, 157 civilians were killed and 395 injured by landmines and explosive remnants of war in Myanmar. About one-third of the casualties were children. The military has placed landmines in homes, village pathways, church compounds, and farms. Military units have continued to force civilians to act as “human shields,” walking ahead of troops to detonate any mines., In August, as fighting spread across Rakhine State, the ethnic armed group Arakan Army located dozens of military-manufactured mines. Casualties are rising from landmines laid along the Bangladesh-Myanmar border, where civilians like Tanchangya collect firewood, farm, and graze cattle. Witnesses reported activity by Myanmar soldiers near border posts in the days before recent mine blasts., Myanmar’s military has long been implicated in numerous serious violations of the laws of war, many amounting to war crimes, in armed conflicts in ethnic minority areas. Since the coup, junta authorities have blocked lifesaving aid and ordered healthcare workers to refuse treatment for mine injuries. For the 1.4 million people displaced across Myanmar, the risk of landmines can hinder their ability to return home., The Monitor report also cited use of mines by non-state armed groups., The 1997 Mine Ban Treaty prohibits antipersonnel mines and requires their clearance, destruction of stocks, and victim assistance. Although Myanmar is not a party to the treaty, the junta’s use remains unlawful: Landmines do not discriminate between civilians and combatants. They kill and maim long after they are placed., At the 20th meeting of states parties to the Mine Ban Treaty, opening this week in Geneva, governments should condemn Myanmar’s use of antipersonnel landmines, while strengthening efforts to cut off the junta from the revenue underwriting its use of these devastating weapons.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-junta-ramps-landmine-use

Monitoring the Agri-food System in Myanmar - Rice Millers - August 2022 survey round,Assessment,IFPRI,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",20 Nov 2022,"In August 2022, we surveyed 467 active rice millers from 13 states and regions across Myanmar to learn more about the impacts of the current political and COVID-19 crises. This report presents the key results and analysis from those interviews., Key findings, Electricity and fuel disruptions were cited as the most significant disruption by 91 percent of millers in August 2022. Rising fuel prices and access issues afflicted smaller, local mills while larger mills were more affected by interruptions in electricity supplies., Continuing a trend from March 2022, banking and credit disruptions were less prevalent in August. Lending and borrowing show only minor changes relative to 2021., Average milling throughput declined by more than 20 percent compared to a year prior, and stored volumes of both paddy and rice showed similar declines., Rice prices and milling margins increased sharply by about 40 percent compared to last year, driven by rising global prices, and, most importantly, by a rapid devaluation of Myanmar kyat. In USD terms, the price increases are more modest and closer to global changes. At the parallel (unofficial) exchange rate, prices have declined., Prices of byproducts (in kyats) have also increased sharply from the last year, especially for rice bran which is important to the animal feed industry., Looking forward, Looking forward to the 2022 monsoon harvest and marketing season, over half of all millers expect a decline in paddy production of at least 10 percent in their townships and an additional 22 percent of millers expect a smaller decline. Just 3 percent expect their local paddy production to be higher in 2022 monsoon than in 2021., Changes in input use (e.g., a decline in fertilizer application) are far and away the most cited reason for lower expected paddy production. Half of millers said that less favorable rainfall patterns compared to 2021 are also a factor in lower paddy production., On top of lower reported throughput in August 2022 and lower storage volumes, a decline in monsoon paddy production would have large implications for both rural and urban households. Lower supply coupled with the continued and widespread disruptions to utilities and transport, could drive prices even higher. At the same time, unpredictable foreign exchange and export policies could make it difficult for value chain actors to anticipate supply and demand conditions, resulting in higher price volatility.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/monitoring-agri-food-system-myanmar-rice-millers-august-2022-survey-round

Getting conflict-affected children back to school,News and Press Release,PIN,"Education
Health",15 Nov 2022,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and 11 years of conflict in Kachin have affected tens of thousands of internally displaced people (IDPs) who have sought shelter in various camps across Kachin State. People in Need (PIN) and our local partner organisation, Diocesan Commission for Education (DCE-Banmaw), support quality education for children in need through Education in Emergencies (EiE) programmes in the most conflict-affected areas in Kachin State., With financial support from the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund (MHF), PIN and DCE-Banmaw distributed student kits, provided home-based learning materials, and facilitated psychosocial support activities for more than 2,700 children in five IDPs camps and one host village in Bhamo district, Kachin State., In June 2022, children were supposed to return to school for the new academic year. However, many parents and caregivers faced financial crises and could not send their children back to school. At that time, PIN and DCE-Banmaw continued to support the educational needs of children between kindergarten (KG) and Grade 8., Htang Nu (name changed), a mother of three school children who received support from PIN and DCE-Banmaw, showed her gratitude to PIN and our donor. “I have three children, in Grades 1, 4, and KG. I have no money to enrol my children in school, so I borrowed money to pay school registration fees. At the beginning of the school year, my children were sad about using old school equipment, which was quite damaged. Now, they are happy to wear new school backpacks and use books, pencils, and raincoats from the distribution.” With these educational materials, children can continue their learning., Hkawng Hkawng (name changed), a 16-year-old, Grade 8 student studying at one of the IDP camps’ schools, dreams of becoming a doctor: “I love receiving student kits, such as backpack, raincoat, books, pens and other things. I am thankful I have them. I want to be a doctor and treat poor people in camps. That is why I study so hard to achieve my goal.” In addition to providing educational materials, children also receive psychosocial support activities to develop their social and emotional capacities and support their well-being., There are numerous challenges facing displaced and conflict-affected families and children, and access to quality education is one of the most urgent and critical needs. Volunteer teachers, educators, and parents play a key role in providing quality education to these children. Yet teachers and parents face many challenges; Lu Hpring (name changed), a headmistress of a school camp, expressed, “Most of the parents in the camps are earning money from daily labour at sugar cane farms, and some are returning to their land from which they fled to plant rice. Sugar cane farmers are losing profits and investments due to lingering border restrictions on exports to China, which have impacted the internally displaced people who can earn money from it.”, Lu Hpring shared concerns regarding enrollment, “Our school accepts kindergarten to Grade 9 students. Some school children experienced late entry into the school system because their parents could not save the money to send them to school. Ongoing conflicts, COVID and border closures have caused several challenges for the parents.”, Likewise, she adds, “despite the financial barriers, parents still face challenges to enrol in school. Most high school students drop out whether they fail or pass the matriculation exam. Parents cannot afford to send them back to school because they lack financial support. As all know, we live in a conflict-affected area with limited resources for better education.”, To help ease these tensions, PIN and DCE-Banmaw provide volunteer teacher incentives, teacher capacity-building training (including on teacher well-being practices), and positive parenting skills workshops to parents and caregivers. Through school improvement planning, education committees and others (including parents and community leaders) work together to define the needs of the schools (e.g., materials and resources, infrastructure needs, training, etc.) and receive funds to address what is most necessary., In Kachin, only “a few local aid organisations can access hard-to-reach areas,” says Gam Seng (name changed), a DCE-Banmaw project focal person. Under this project, and through People in Need’s leadership, providing educational support to the most hard-to-reach children has been possible. A holistic approach to education is needed, even in these areas. “That is why DCE-Banmaw and PIN aim to strengthen quality education,” including by training “local teachers and camp-based volunteer educators with the Teaching in Crisis Contexts (TiCC) and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) curricula” and providing activities that can help to “protect the children,” such psychosocial support activities and “parent [and caregiver] skills workshops.”, *The names of certain individuals and locations have been changed for their protection., Author: Aye Pyae Sone, Communication officer for Myanmar",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/getting-conflict-affected-children-back-school

According to the UN, an estimated 1,443,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) were reported across the country as of 1 November 2022, including 1,113,000 people who have been newly displaced since 1 February 2021., In the North-West, heavy armed clashes, air strikes and explosions were reported, as well as the destruction of civilian infrastructure. The transportation of medicine and food remains restricted, particularly in Sagaing Region, where the needs are most acute., In Rakhine and Chin (South) States, fighting continues and has resulted in the displacement of some 16,700 people since August 2022, according to the latest UN figures. Movement restrictions and blocked roads and supply chains to Rakhine State (North), as well as restrictions on humanitarian access – limited to life-saving activities such as food and medical support – have seriously impacted the availability and price of basic commodities in local markets., In Kachin and Shan (North), tensions were high following a 23 October air strike in Hpakant Township, Kachin State, where serious fatalities were reported. The price of various goods such as medicine and food has surged due to strict transportation restrictions. In Shan State (North), the escalating conflict has led to forced recruitment and extortion., In the South-East, air strikes and shelling persisted with security checks and roadblocks remaining the main barrier to movement. Humanitarian access is increasingly restricted, notably in Kayah and Kayin State, as food and medicine shortages continue to be reported by displaced families. In Tanintharyi Region, some 2,900 displaced people close to Tanintharyi town returned to their villages of origin after the security situation reportedly improved.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-emergency-update-1-november-2022

"Kler Lwee Htoo District Incident Report: Two villagers were seriously injured in a landmine explosion in Ler Doh Township, Kler Lwee Htoo District, July 2022",Situation Report,KHRG,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",4 Nov 2022,"This Incident Report describes events that occurred in Ler Doh (Kyaukkyi) Township, Kler Lwee Htoo (Nyaunglebin) District in July 2022. On July 9th 2022, at around 7:00 am, a 4-year-old boy stepped on a landmine, injuring himself and his 24-year-old mother. The incident occurred at a dock located three miles away from where the victims live in Y--- village, A--- village tract, Ler Doh Township, Kler Lwee Htoo District. The mother was bringing her son to the Ka Yin Yoe hospital because he was sick. The boy sustained serious injuries to both of his legs and his mother was injured on her head and face, with minor injuries to her elbow. As the family works to secure their livelihood as day labourers, the costs tied to treatment have left them facing financial difficulties. Although they were provided some financial support, they still need money to cover travel costs.[1], Part 1 – Incident Details, Type of Incident: Landmine explosion, Date of Incident(s): July 9th 2022, Incident Location (Village, Township and District): At a dock located three miles away from Y--- village, A--- village tract[2], Ler Doh Township, Kler Lwee Htoo District, Victim Information, Name: U---, Age: 4 years old, Sex: Male, Ethnicity: Bamar[3], Family: Yes, Occupation: None (dependent), Religion: Buddhist, Position: Villager, Village: Y---, A--- village tract, Ler Doh Township, Kler Lwee Htoo District, Name: B---, Age: 24 years old, Sex: Female, Ethnicity: Bamar, Family: Yes, Occupation: Day labourer, Religion: Buddhist, Position: Villager, Village: Y---, A--- village tract, Ler Doh Township, Kler Lwee Htoo District, Part 2 - Information Quality, 1. Explain in detail how you collected this information., On July 22nd 2022, the KHRG field researcher contacted a local Karen National Union (KNU)[4] leader to get the contact number of the victims’ family members for detailed information about the incident after the news emerged on social media. On July 23rd 2022, the KHRG field researcher conducted an interview with T---, one of the family members., 2. Explain how the source verified this information., The information was provided by T---, the great uncle of the boy who was injured in the landmine explosion. He is one of the guardians of the boy, and took responsibility for sending his grandnephew and his niece to the hospital, gave recommendations for their treatment, and provided his signature to approve of the medical treatment of the victims., Part 3 – Complete Description of the Incident, Describe the Incident(s) in complete detail. For each incident, be sure to include 1) when the incident happened, 2) where it happened, 3) what happened, 4) how it happened, 5) who was involved, and 6) why it happened. Also describe any villager response(s) to the incident, the aftermath and the current living situation of the victims. Please use the space prepared below, and create an attachment if needed., At around 7:00 am on July 9th 2022, U---, a 4-year-old boy, stepped on a landmine at a dock in Y--- village, A--- village tract, Ler Doh Township, Kler Lwee Htoo District, injuring himself and his 24-year-old mother, B---. The victims were three miles away from their home in Y--- village. They were waiting for a boat to go to the Ka Yin Yoe hospital in Kyauk Ta Gha (Kyauktaga) Township [Bago Region, outside of KHRG’s operational area] because the boy was sick. B--- thought that she and her son could travel to the Ka Yin Yoe hospital when they saw other people were crossing from Y--- village to I--- village to go to a funeral ceremony for a relative. The boy stepped on the landmine near the dock when he got off the dock to urinate. Due to the landmine explosion, the boy sustained serious injuries to both of his legs and the mother to her head and face, along with minor injuries to her elbow., After the landmine explosion, B--- tried to carry her son back to her village to get treatment for his injuries from village healthcare workers. On the way back to the village, they met a female villager from Y--- village who took them back to the village by motorbike, which took half an hour. B--- was unconscious when they arrived back to the village due to her injuries and shock. The healthcare workers in the village could not do anything to treat the boy because they had inadequate medical supplies, so U--- and B--- were sent to the Ka Yin Yoe hospital [in Kyauk Ta Gha Township] by boat [from the same dock where they were injured], accompanied by seven family members. It took them about 30 minutes to get to the Ka Yin Yoe hospital. A doctor from the Ka Yin Yoe hospital bandaged the injuries that the two victims sustained from the landmine explosion. The Ka Yin Yoe hospital was however unable to fully treat the injuries due to a lack of medical supplies. The victims were then transferred (by two ambulances) to Kyauktaga [Public] Hospital. When the boy and his mother were sent to Kyauktaga Hospital, the great uncle, T---, noticed that his grandnephew’s lips started to become pale. T--- told the healthcare workers at Kyauktaga Hospital to give U--- a blood transfusion, which the doctors did. Healthcare workers at Kyauktaga Hospital then instructed to transfer U--- and B--- to Pago [Bago] General Hospital as they also lacked adequate medical supplies. At first, the great uncle of U--- considered sending his grandnephew and his niece to Yangon General Hospital, but instead followed the recommendation of Kyauktaga Hospital., As soon as the blood transfusion was finished, the boy and his mother were sent to the Pago General Hospital in Bago Town and arrived there at around 12:00 pm on July 9th. After they arrived at the Pago General Hospital, the doctor told the great uncle of the victim that his grandnephew needed to have both of his legs amputated. The doctors amputated Y---’s legs at around 3:00 pm. B--- was also in critical condition and required treatment for her injuries from the landmine fragments. The boy and his mother were hospitalised for seven days at Pago General Hospital. On July 15th 2022, they were discharged from the hospital. After the hospitalisation, the boy and mother stayed at E--- village at an acquaintance’s house [village tract not specified] for medical follow up at Kyauktaga Hospital. [At the time of reporting] neither the boy nor his mother had made a full recovery yet.] The Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) contacted the Hpa-an prosthetic factory for U---’s prosthetic legs. The prosthetics will be given to the boy after two months [to wait for his injuries to heal]., The victims received 100,000 kyats [USD 47.62][5] from a State Administration Council (SAC)[6] army captain in Kyauktaga Town. A [cabinet] minister of the Pago Division also provided the victims 1,000,000 kyats [USD 476.19]. U---’s father is working as a day labourer in Thailand and sent his family some financial support [did not specify the amount]. The MRCS also provided the victims 600,000 kyats [USD 285.71] for the boy. There were seven family members, including the great uncle, who accompanied the victims to the different hospitals. It cost 1,300,000 kyats [USD 619.05] for the family members to pay for all of their travel and food costs. However, it did not cost anything for the medical treatment for the victims [the victims were not charged for the treatment]., It is unknown which armed group planted the landmine because the location of the landmine incident was an area where SAC troops, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA),[7] and other local ethnic armed groups have been operating. There had never been a landmine incident in Y--- village in the past. This was the first time a landmine incident happened there. The villagers from Y--- village have never attended a Mine Risk Awareness training. Now, the villagers are fearful of landmine explosions., The family members of the victims are ordinary day labourers who have no farmland. Therefore, the father of the child has to work in Thailand for the family’s livelihood. The family still needs help from charity [aid] organisations [to cover the travel costs]. The victim’s great uncle does not want landmines to be planted in or nearby the village because they interfere with villagers’ livelihoods and ability to travel., Part 4 - Permission for Using the Details, Did the victim(s) provide permission to use this information? Explain how that permission was provided., The interviewee gave permission to document the information and publish it.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/kler-lwee-htoo-district-incident-report-two-villagers-were-seriously-injured-landmine-explosion-ler-doh-township-kler-lwee-htoo-district-july-2022

Summary of the 10th Annual Meeting of the Global Network of R2P Focal Points,News and Press Release,GCR2P,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",3 Nov 2022,"The Global Network of R2P Focal Points held its tenth annual meeting from 15-16 September 2022 in Washington, D.C. The meeting, hosted by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect at the headquarters of the Organization of American States (OAS), brought together senior officials from governments and regional organizations, the UN Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and members of civil society., The tenth annual meeting provided R2P Focal Points with a platform to exchange ideas and experiences regarding the effective implementation of R2P, as well as on their individual roles in the prevention of atrocities. Participants considered how regional organizations contribute to the prevention of and response to mass atrocities and how these bodies can be essential tools in establishing hemispheres of peace. R2P Focal Points also reflected upon the experiences of populations in atrocity situations – examining the cases of Myanmar (Burma), Ukraine and Venezuela – and discussed regional and national responses to atrocity crimes., The meeting also featured a panel discussion on the capacity of civil society to mobilize action on R2P and how members of the Global Network can better harness information gathered by civil society in their decision-making. In continuation of discussions at previous meetings, R2P Focal Points also addressed the linkage between R2P and the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda and discussed the gendered dimensions of atrocity prevention, particularly with regard to women, girls and LGBTQIA groups as agents of change., The following summary provides an overview of the key messages delivered by expert panelists, as well as the outcomes of discussions among R2P Focal Points during the two-day meeting., OPENING CEREMONY, The meeting was called to order by the Secretary General of the OAS, H.E. Luis Almagro Lemes. Hel was joined by the UN Special Adviser on R2P, George Okoth-Obbo; the Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations of the United States (US) Department of State, Anne Witkowsky; and the Executive Director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, Savita Pawnday., In his opening remarks, Secretary General Almagro emphasized the value of regional organizations and the relationship between upholding R2P and ensuring “hemispheres of peace.” He noted the decades of peace in his region and emphasized that the instrumentalization of R2P and other international principles emanates from the need to maintain this “regional peace.” Special Adviser Okoth-Obbo noted the role of R2P Focal Points, as orchestrators and translators for institutionalizing R2P within domestic and foreign policies. Pawnday stressed the significant normative progress since the global commitment to R2P was originally created, as well as progress towards accountability for atrocity crimes. In spite of unprecedented challenges posed by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, she noted the steadfast commitment of states and organizations within the Global Network to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing., REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF R2P, Regional organizations play a unique role in preventing and responding to mass atrocities, as well as in promoting individual and collective action by their member states. These organizations are often best placed to guide multilateral action on emerging atrocity risks in their region as they may have a better understanding of the relevant political and societal dynamics within member states where atrocities are taking place. These organizations are also composed of neighboring states who may be disproportionately affected in the aftermath of atrocities. Participants discussed how to proactively “regionalize” prevention strategies to address risk factors in their own neighborhoods. This includes working with other states to integrate atrocity prevention strategies that address structural risk factors within their countries, as well as taking collective action to respond to emerging situations within neighboring states., While R2P may not be explicitly articulated in their charters or founding documents, many regional organizations have an institutional mandate that relates to atrocity prevention, as highlighted by Jared Genser, OAS Special Adviser on R2P, and Alexandre Polack, Deputy First Counsellor at the European Union delegation to the US. In this regard, the panelists discussed what tools regional organizations have for responding to emerging risks in their region and for assisting member states in the prevention atrocities. R2P Focal Points also discussed the role that some organizations play in alleviating atrocity risks in other regions through coordinated assistance and various forms of pressure., On the margins of the meeting the OAS launched a report entitled, “The Responsibility to Protect and the Organization of American States: A Path Forward for Atrocity Prevention and Response in the Americas.” While the report specifically addresses the OAS context, its thematic findings and recommendations, such as to further develop early warning systems, may be applicable to other organization and regions., IDENTIFYING SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES IN PREVENTING ATROCITIES, In order to reflect on missed opportunities for prevention and challenges in how governments have reacted to atrocities, R2P Focal Points discussed three country situations: Myanmar, Ukraine and Venezuela. The US Under Secretary for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, H.E. Uzra Zeya, opened the session, affirming the US’s commitment to atrocity prevention and response with the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act and the new “U.S. Strategy to Anticipate, Prevent, and Respond to Atrocities.”, The session featured a panel with individuals from the three focus countries, including H.E. Oksana Markarova, Ambassador of Ukraine to the US; Beatriz Borges, Executive Director of Centro de Justicia y Paz (CEPAZ); and Wai Wai Nu, Founder and Executive Director of the Women’s Peace Network. Panelists emphasized the importance of governments engaging not only with international civil society, but also with local actors, particularly victim and survivor communities and others affected by atrocities, to develop prevention strategies and responses that are rights-based and community-informed., While all three countries have faced unique challenges, several lessons learned emerged across the session. Participants raised the need for a holistic response that accounts for the multi-faceted nature of certain situations – where economic and humanitarian crises trigger political repression or conflict and vice versa – to ensure that the risk of atrocities is not deprioritized among other intersecting concerns. Moreover, participants noted that the international community should take early, informed approaches to influence changes in behavior before crimes have taken place. More often than not, the international community fails to respond to early warning signs. Instead of taking early, preventive steps, the international community is typically reactive when mass atrocity crimes are already occurring and relies upon responses grounded in punitive measures and condemnation., Acknowledging that R2P Focal Points have a special responsibility to communicate the urgency of atrocity situations to their political leadership, even when the affected country is not necessarily a foreign policy priority for their government, participants also discussed factors that can create and expand the political will to respond to atrocities in a timely and effective manner. In this regard, participants discussed how to learn from the unprecedented, wide-ranging international response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine to generate meaningful reactions when atrocities and other grave breaches of international law occur elsewhere. This discussion also highlighted the importance of creatively engaging with UN agencies and decision-making bodies, regional organizations and other stakeholders in light of ongoing disagreements and conflicts of interest on the UN Security Council (UNSC)., THE ROLE OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN MOBILIZING ACTION TO UPHOLD R2P, Civil society organizations (CSOs) are key actors in preventing serious human rights violations and atrocity crimes. CSOs are often the first to witness the indicators of mass atrocity risks and are equipped with in-depth understanding and expertise that states should incorporate into any atrocity prevention response. Civil society is also at the forefront of promoting justice and accountability, monitoring and reporting on international law violations, working directly with affected communities and mobilizing action on the national, regional and multilateral levels., This session featured presentations by Maria Eugenia Carbone, Director of the Latin America Program at the Auschwitz Institute for the Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities; Naomi Kikoler, Director of the Simon Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum; Kate Ferguson, Co-Executive Director and Head of Research and Policy at Protection Approaches; and Andrei Serbin Pont, Director of CRIES. The discussion explored how R2P Focal Points can institutionalize relationships and engage with CSOs when developing strategies to implement R2P. Participants also discussed how governments can support the activism of local community actors, including women, youth and racial, religious and ethnic minority groups, to ensure a more coordinated and holistic approach to atrocity prevention., Many states within the Global Network noted the positive role that CSOs play in strengthening prevention in both domestic and foreign policy, including through providing strategic policy advice, risk analysis and dissemination of information collected by civil society actors and affected communities. Government engagement with CSOs presents opportunities for dialogue to clarify what makes atrocities distinct from other forms of violence and how to tailor responses. Consultations between CSOs and their national governments have also contributed to the development of policies that enable government offices and ministries to have explicit conversations on atrocity prevention. While these conversations may not prompt the institutionalization of R2P specific language, by enabling understanding of the additional context, terms and concepts around atrocity prevention they may strengthen the work of those who are engaged and motivated to respond., GENDERING R2P, Understanding the linkages and gendered dynamics of atrocities can help governments, regional organizations and the international community to holistically protect populations at risk. Gender equality, women’s empowerment and the protection of women’s rights – principles that are integral to the WPS agenda – are also intrinsic to the prevention of atrocities and conflict., The panel featured remarks from Hilary Anderson, Senior Gender Specialist at the Inter-American Commission of Women; Katrina Fotovat, Senior Official at the US State Department Office of Global Women’s Issues; and Jaclyn Streitfeld-Hall, Director of Policy and Research at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect. Panelists explored methods to achieve a holistic, gendered and intersectional approach to identifying risks, preventing atrocities, holding perpetrators accountable and reconciling communities., States and regional organizations have undertaken numerous measures to uphold commitments to R2P and WPS in parallel, including adopting conclusions on WPS and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) that address atrocity risks, integrating a gender perspective and applying the atrocity prevention lens to all of their work across the conflict cycle, and appointing both an R2P Focal Point and WPS Focal Point who can work collaboratively on shared agendas. Despite some progress in integrating gender within R2P, the institutional frameworks that influence policymakers and actors in the field still often lack a nuanced approach to including women’s experiences within atrocity prevention or the inclusion of a gendered lens more broadly., In addition to addressing SGBV and the risk of atrocity crimes, participants discussed how to expand their understanding of the nuanced role gender plays in atrocity prevention. There is sometimes a conflation between the WPS agenda, women issues and gender that does not recognize the full spectrum of gendered vulnerabilities, such as risks unique to men or members of the LGBTQI+ community. R2P Focal Points recognized that violence experienced by women in situations of mass atrocities is not always sexual in nature, and that other gender identities may experience sexual violence. States were urged to adopt an approach that considers structural gender inequality as a potential risk factor of atrocities., ATROCITY PREVENTION IN PRACTICE: MECHANISMS FOR IMPLEMENTING R2P, States, regional organizations and multilateral bodies have developed and supported various mechanisms and tools to prevent atrocities and implement R2P. These range from mechanisms for enhanced early warning and risk assessments, to national policies and practices that support diversity and curb hate speech, to establishing international investigative mechanisms that collect and preserve evidence of ongoing atrocities and other actions at the UN Human Rights Council and UNSC that bring attention to specific country situations where civilians are at risk of atrocities., During this session, participants identified and discussed good practices in atrocity prevention that R2P Focal Points and their governments can implement. The session included remarks by Special Adviser Okoth-Obbo; H.E. Mutlaq Al-Qahtani, Special Envoy of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar for Counterterrorism and Mediation of Conflict Resolution; Martin Mennecke, Academic Adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and Professor at the University of Southern Denmark; Rebecca Barber, Mary Wing-Ming Lee Senior Human Rights Research Fellow, Asia-Pacific Centre for the Responsibility to Protect., The Global Network also consulted on the creation of a global “Framework for Implementation.” The proposed document seeks to collate best practices and lessons learned on atrocity prevention into a comprehensive, actionable framework detailing how states can implement R2P within their domestic and foreign policy., Participants also stressed the importance of establishing a historical memory for the Global Network to ensure accurate, transparent and consistent understanding of best practices for implementing R2P. One speaker recommended that prior to the annual meeting each R2P Focal Point prepare a one-page report on the progress made within their system on atrocity prevention over the course of the past year. Other suggestions included holding regular regional meetings for R2P Focal Points to provide an opportunity for collaboration and knowledge sharing among neighboring states., RECOMMENDATIONS, Several key recommendations emerged during the two-day meeting. These recommendations are relevant for individual R2P Focal Points, as well as states, regional and international organizations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/summary-10th-annual-meeting-global-network-r2p-focal-points
The precarious situation of agricultural wage laborers in Myanmar,Assessment,IFPRI,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",31 Oct 2022,"To understand the effects of COVID-19, the political crisis, and other shocks on Myanmar’s agricultural wage laborers (those workers relying on casual labor in agriculture), we rely on data from three rounds of the Myanmar Household Welfare Survey and two rounds of the Myanmar Agricultural Performance Survey, fielded in 2021 and 2022., Key findings, The number of people making a living from agricultural wages is very important in Myanmar: 16 percent of rural households – 1.3 million households – considered agricultural wages their most important source of income in Quarter 3 of 2022., Agricultural wages increased by 12 percent in nominal terms between the monsoon of 2021 and 2022. However, prices of goods and services increased more rapidly over this period. Prices of a typical food basket increased by 58 percent between July 2021 and August 2022 while the price of rice – the basic staple – increased by 43 percent., To understand changes in ‘real’ wages, we use three alternative measures of inflation as ‘deflators’. Real agricultural wages declined over the last year by:, The agricultural wage gap between men and women is increasing: It was 21 percent during the monsoon of 2020 but had widened to 28 percent during the monsoon of 2022., Welfare indicators are substantially worse for agricultural wage laborers compared to the rest of the rural population. As incomes worsened for agricultural wage laborers, their welfare indicators (food security and asset poverty rates) also worsened., Looking forward",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/precarious-situation-agricultural-wage-laborers-myanmar

Food and Nutrition",31 Oct 2022,"To capture disruptions and coping strategies in Myanmar’s crops trade sector, a phone survey was conducted in August 2022 with a sample of 359 commodity traders in 14 states and regions., Key Findings, Traders report large year-over-year price increases for all crops. Average rice prices are about 41 percent higher than August 2021; groundnut prices are about 80 percent higher; and sesame, maize, and chickpea prices are at least 40 percent higher. Most of the price increases are attributable to the devaluation of the kyat and rising global prices, but local trade disruptions and demand and supply shifts also contribute., Transportation disruptions continue to be the most salient. Nearly 90 percent of traders reported higher fuel and transport costs, and more than 50 percent reported difficulty accessing fuel and movement restrictions. Higher transportation costs were the most common reason given for overall crop price increases., While the sample contains only a few exporters, rapidly changing foreign exchange and export policies have directly disrupted crop trade. Nearly 14 percent of traders changed their crops traded as a result of these policies, and 33 percent reported the policies as main reason for price changes., Despite rising crop and transport prices, trader margins as a percentage of buying prices have declined in the past year. The trading sector is proving to be resilient and competitive, and trading margins are not contributing to increased consumer prices., Looking ahead, With the monsoon marketing season beginning, higher crop prices are good for farmers as they try to recover higher production costs. However, the high prices are a burden for consumers, and may impact food security., Transportation costs and disruptions continue to affect inter-regional trade and they drive a wedge between producer and consumer prices, with large welfare costs for the country as a whole., Unstable export and foreign exchange policies create uncertainty in the import and export market with negative effects on both producers and traders.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/monitoring-agri-food-system-myanmar-agricultural-crop-traders-august-2022-survey

Deadly Cargo: Exposing the Supply Chain that Fuels War Crimes in Myanmar [EN/MY],Analysis,Amnesty,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",3 Nov 2022,"Myanmar: Investigation reveals aviation fuel supply chain linked to war crimes, The international community must urgently prevent shipments of aviation fuel from reaching the Myanmar military, Amnesty International said today, as it published an investigation into the companies involved in the supply chain, as well as shocking new accounts of deadly air strikes on civilians., Deadly Cargo: Exposing the Supply Chain that Fuels War Crimes in Myanmar provides the most detailed look into aviation fuel since the military seized power in the 2021 coup, from the distant port where the fuel originally departed to the unlawful air strikes that killed civilians – and every step in between., “These air strikes have devastated families, terrorized civilians, killed and maimed victims. But if the planes can’t fuel up, they can’t fly out and wreak havoc. Today we are calling on suppliers, shipping agents, vessel owners and maritime insurers to withdraw from a supply chain that is benefiting the Myanmar Air Force,” said Amnesty International Secretary General Agnès Callamard., “There can be no justification for participating in the supply of aviation fuel to a military that has a flagrant contempt for human rights and has been repeatedly accused of committing war crimes, crimes against humanity and other grave human rights violations.”, Amnesty International’s research was carried out in collaboration with Justice For Myanmar and with the support of other civil society organizations such as Burma Campaign UK., The report draws on a wide range of sources, including leaked company documents, corporate filings, vessel-tracking data, satellite imagery, public records, and exclusive interviews with defectors from the Myanmar Air Force and sources close to Puma Energy., It also features testimony from survivors of air strikes, who shared their harrowing experiences to shed light on the human toll of these unlawful attacks. Victims of air strikes are among the more than 2,300 civilians killed by the military since the coup., Ka Naw, a 73-year-old man who witnessed an air strike on a populated village in Kayah (Karenni) State, eastern Myanmar, that killed two civilians in February 2022, describes what it was like., “The sound was so loud. I saw [the] jets going down, bombing, and then going up again,” he said. “They flew very low… The first [pass], they bombed and then they turned around and shot with machine gun.”, Supply Chain Exposed, Businesses have a responsibility to respect human rights wherever they operate. But Amnesty International’s evidence published today demonstrates that the actions of some companies involved in the supply of aviation fuel to Myanmar link them to the Myanmar military’s commission of war crimes., Since 2015, the main foreign business involved in the handling, storage and distribution of aviation fuel in Myanmar has been Puma Energy, which is largely owned by global commodity trading giant, Trafigura. It has operated in Myanmar though its subsidiary Puma Energy Asia Sun (PEAS) and joint venture National Energy Puma Aviation Services (NEPAS). According to Puma Energy, since February 2021 and until 5 October 2022, it limited its operations to the provision of aviation fuel for civilian purposes. However, this report shows otherwise., Our findings indicate that aviation fuel (Jet A-1) enters Myanmar primarily through a terminal in Thilawa port managed by PEAS. Amnesty International identified eight separate shipments of aviation fuel that were offloaded at the terminal between February 2021 and mid-September 2022., The fuel was then stored at the PEAS terminal until transported by tanker truck to NEPAS storage facilities and military air bases across the country. Based on data obtained from December 2021 to August 2022, some NEPAS storage facilities are linked to military air bases, showing that civilian and military use of aviation fuel is inextricably linked. By facilitating the Myanmar military’s access to aviation fuel, Puma Energy contributed to human rights harm caused by the Myanmar military., Puma Energy itself acknowledged to Amnesty International that it had “become aware of reports of the military forcibly demanding fuel at selected NEPAS airport facilities. These reported incidents undermined our confidence in NEPAS’s ability to maintain the controls that were put in place” by Puma Energy., On 26 September, Amnesty International presented Puma Energy with evidence from this report. Ten days later, the company announced it was leaving the country and selling its business in Myanmar., “We acknowledge Puma Energy’s decision to exit from Myanmar, but the announcement of sales to an undisclosed ‘locally-owned private company’ raises entirely new concerns about the need to disengage responsibly, transparently, and to avoid leaving aviation fuel infrastructure in the hands of the Myanmar military,” said Montse Ferrer, Business and Human Rights Researcher at Amnesty International., “Puma Energy must responsibly withdraw and contribute to the remediation of any harm. This should begin with consultations with representatives of the Myanmar communities that have been affected by unlawful air strikes to find appropriate measures of reparation,” Ferrer said., Shipments Revealed, But Puma is not alone. Other companies play significant roles in the supply chain of aviation fuel in Myanmar, linking them to the same human rights violations., Between February 2021 and 17 September 2022, at least seven oil tankers offloaded eight shipments of aviation fuel at the port terminal managed by Puma Energy’s subsidiary PEAS at Thilawa in the commercial capital Yangon., Amnesty International confirmed the supplier and date of four of the shipments: PetroChina’s wholly-owned Singapore Petroleum Company (SPC) (December 2021), Russia’s Rosneft (December 2021), Chevron Singapore (February 2022) and Thai Oil (June 2022). Also, ExxonMobil is linked to a shipment in June 2022., Documents obtained by Amnesty International show the shipments from Thai Oil and PetroChina’s SPC were intended for use by the Myanmar Air Force., Representatives of Rosneft, Chevron and Thai Oil told Amnesty International they had received assurances that the shipments would be for civilian purposes only. PetroChina’s SPC did not respond to requests for comment. In response to Amnesty International’s letters, Thai Oil stated it will pause sales of Jet A-1 aviation fuel to Myanmar “until no such concerned issue” exists., “Any company conducting human rights due diligence should realize that selling aviation fuel to a customer located in a country ruled by a military with an atrocious human rights record at the very least poses high risks,” said Ferrer., Korean vessel owner Pan Ocean and Norwegian shipping company Wilhelmsen were also found to be involved in a number of aviation fuel shipments. Pan Ocean did not respond to Amnesty. Wilhelmsen said they believed the shipments were for civilian purposes, but also said they will “immediately cease to provide agency services of any kind for vessel or cargo owners discharging Jet A-1 aviation fuel at ports in Myanmar”., Air strike documentation, In the course of this research, Amnesty International documented 16 unlawful air attacks that took place between March 2021 and August 2022 in Kayah, Kayin and Chin States as well as in Sagaing Region., In a concerning new development, in two such strikes Amnesty International documented the Myanmar military’s use of cluster munitions, which are internationally banned as they are inherently indiscriminate., Amnesty International has been able to directly link four air bases – Hmawbi, Magway, Tada-U and Taungoo – to attacks that amount to war crimes., The documented air attacks collectively killed at least 15 civilians, injured at least 36 other civilians, and destroyed homes, religious buildings, schools, medical facilities and a camp for displaced persons., The death toll from air strikes is based on what Amnesty International was able to verify through direct evidence, including consistent witness testimony and the names of victims, often corroborated by photographic and video material of attacks., Based on media reports and separate human rights documentation, there has been a much wider pattern of unlawful air strikes that have killed and injured civilians across Myanmar, meaning the actual death toll is much higher., In the vast majority of these documented cases, only civilians appear to have been present at the location of the strike at the time of the attack., Teenage sisters Maria and Caroline, who were around 15 and 12 years old, were killed in a late-night air strike on 17 January 2022 at the Ree Khee Bu IDP in Kayah State, which borders Thailand. Nu Nu, a man in his 50s, was also killed. Kaw Reh, the 50-year-old father of the girls who had been staying in another village that night, arrived the next morning to find their bodies covered in cloth., “They placed the bodies of my daughters and the man in the church. I just wanted to see the bodies and sit there,” he said, adding that the family’s belongings at the bombing site were either destroyed by shrapnel or burned by other residents because there were “organs and blood everywhere”. His surviving daughter, once outgoing and active, no longer plays with other children., In July 2022, two Amnesty International researchers visited the site of the attack and surveyed the craters from the bombs and any remaining damage. Given the lack of fighters or other military objectives in the vicinity at the time of the strike, this appears to be a direct attack on civilians and would constitute a war crime., “The aviation fuel supplied, imported, stored and distributed by a number of companies has been essential to the Myanmar military in carrying out these types of horrifying air strikes. It’s time to break the back of the supply chain of aviation fuel to Myanmar’s Air Force once and for all,” said Ferrer.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/deadly-cargo-exposing-supply-chain-fuels-war-crimes-myanmar-enmy

Shelter and Non-Food Items",2 Nov 2022,"In early-October the MAU surveyed displaced households in/around Kayah (Karenni) State to better understand the challenges they face. Data are based on a probability sample representing 1300 households enrolled in cash assistance programs. MAU reports are available online at www.themimu.info/market-analysis-unit., KEY FINDINGS, Eighty-eight percent of households surveyed remained displaced as of September 2022, and just 10% had returned to their home;, Fifty-two percent were living outside their original township, and 23% were in another state;, Forty-eight percent of households were living in a a temporary shelter or displaced site, in many cases more than one year after leaving their home;, Fifteen percent said their household could not travel to a food market in the past month, and these households reported higher rates of negative coping behaviors;, Roughly one-third said various living conditions were poor, and very few described them as ""good;"", Nine percent of households ran out of food at some point in the past month, and 15% said someone in their house skipped a meal., BACKGROUND, Since early-2021, Kayah State has seen a rise in armed conflict and growing numbers of displaced persons. According to data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), the number of monthly conflict-related events in Kayah State spiked in May 2021 and again in January 2022. Throughout 2022, conflict in Kayah State has continued to dip and spike periodically (see Figure 1).1 As of September 2022, the United Nations estimates there to be nearly 75,000 IDPs in Kayah State and an additional 30,000 IDPs in neighboring Pekon Township (South Shan).2 The IDP populations of Demoso, Hpruso, Loikaw and Pekon Townships are among the largest township-level IDP populations in Myanmar., This study surveyed households displaced by armed conflict to understand their living conditions and access to markets/goods. The survey of 343 households represents a population of roughly 1300 households enrolled in one or more cash programs. Three-quarters of all respondents were most-recently displaced between April and June 2021, while most others were displaced in the following 12 months. Nearly all participants previously received cash assistance from one or more parties (albeit at various points in time), however the study is not intended as an evaluation of the effectiveness of cash programs; nor is the study intended to represent all IDPs in Kayah State. The purpose of the study was to understand the basic needs of IDPs and their ability to address those needs through access to markets and essential goods.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/kayahkarenni-state-idps-household-survey-october-2022

Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",31 Oct 2022,"Myanmar’s women-led CSOs play a critical leadership role in promoting human rights and advancing Women, Peace and Security., Twenty-two years on from the adoption of United Nations Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on 31 October 2000, women activists and women-led organizations all over the world continue to drive efforts to make, build and sustain peace. They have successfully broadened the view that women must be meaningfully engaged in the decisions that impact their lives and that their participation in peacebuilding processes can contribute to more lasting peace. UNSCR 1325 represents an important commitment made by Member States to take active steps in addressing the ways in which women and girls are impacted by violent conflict and ensure they are represented in peace and security processes., The escalating conflict in Myanmar has increased pre-existing inequalities and vulnerabilities of women and girls to conflict-related sexual violence, early and forced marriages, human trafficking, sexual exploitation and irregular labour migration. The compounded crisis dramatically increased levels of poverty and food insecurity across the country, with many reports highlighting the disproportionate impact on women. In the words of a Kachin woman: “I feel unsafe and I always have to be prepared to flee from shootings and bombings. Surviving is the priority, and I’m not able to make money.”, Despite facing significant challenges, women-led organizations are ensuring that the gendered aspects of violent conflict are recognized and women are meaningfully engaged in the humanitarian response., As a result of their efforts and strategic adjustments to provide relief and recovery support, Myanmar was amongst a small number of countries that saw an increase in the participation of local women-led organizations in humanitarian planning between 2020 - 2021, according to the UN Secretary-General’s 2022 Report on Women, Peace and Security., These organisations are also looking to the future, through initiatives focused on developing a cadre of women peace trainers, or identifying strategies to ensure women’s participation and representation in future political processes. “Some people are now demanding Myanmar be a Federal Union,” a female participant* at a Gender and Federalism training said. “We’re analysing the importance of women’s participation in politics, the role of civil society organisations, and identifying the opportunities and challenges of Federalism in advancing gender equality,” she added., Unfortunately, global aid to peace and security continues to underprioritize gender equality, with women-led organizations’ contributions being undervalued and under-resourced. The Women, Peace and Security agenda in Myanmar is more relevant than ever, and there remains a clear need for dedicated resources to support women-led civil society efforts to respond to current situation. At the core of this agenda is the recognition of the immense sacrifices, the determination, persistence and the innovation of women and women-led organizations., UN Women Myanmar works with various partners to ensure women and girls affected by crises lead, participate in and benefit from relief, response, peace and development efforts., *Name of the female participant is not revealed for security reasons.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/women-led-organizations-are-key-ensure-women-peace-and-security-agenda

How political engineering can make health a bridge to peace: lessons from a Primary Health Care Project in Myanmar’s border areas,Analysis,BMJ,"Health
Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding",9 Oct 2022,"Anne Décobert, Tom Traill, Si Thura, Adam Richards, Abstract, This case study analyses a health project that focused on peacebuilding in addition to service provision, and the impacts of this dual focus in contested territories of Southeast Myanmar. The Swiss-funded Primary Health Care Project provided equal funds to both ‘sides’ in a decades-long conflict, and brought people together in ways designed to build trust. The case study demonstrates that health can play a valuable role in peace formation, if relationships are engineered in a politically sensitive way, at the right time. Whereas much of the literature on ‘health as a bridge to peace’ focuses on the apolitical in health, here the explicitly political approach and the deliberate adoption of neutrality as a tool for engaging with different parties were what enabled health to contribute to peace, using a political window of opportunity created by ceasefires and the beginnings of democratic transition in Myanmar. We argue that this approach was essential for health to contribute to bottom-up processes of peace formation—though the scope of the gains is necessarily limited. Crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and military coup in Myanmar can undermine the resilience and limit the impacts of such endeavours, yet there is reason to be hopeful about the small but significant contributions that can be made to peace through politically sensitive health projects., Read the full report.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/how-political-engineering-can-make-health-bridge-peace-lessons-primary-health-care-project-myanmars-border-areas

Protection and Human Rights",1 Nov 2022,"This interview describes an incident that occurred in P’Loo Hpa Doh village, also known locally as P’Loo Gyi village, P’Loo village tract, Kaw T’Ree (Kawkareik) Township, Dooplaya District in March 2022. A 16-year-old boy was killed by a mortar explosion following State Administration Council (SAC) shelling while temporarily returning to his village during displacement. Thousands of villagers, including the victim and his family, were displaced by fighting in P’Loo Hpa Doh village in December 2021. The interview also covers air strikes and indiscriminate shelling in the village between January and April 2022, which resulted in the death of one villager and serious injury of another.[1], Interview | P’Loo Hpa Doh village, P’Loo village tract[2], Kaw T’Ree (Kawkareik) Township, Dooplaya District (March 2022), Name: Naw M---

Occupation: N/A, What is your name, sister?
My name is Naw M---., How are you related to the boy who was killed by the explosion?
He is the son of my big brother., Does he still have his parents [are his parents still alive]?
Yes, he still has parents but his parents are divorced., Where are you living currently?
I am now in Ler Khaw village [known as Ya Paw in Thai], Thailand., Where were you when the fighting happened [in P’Loo Hpa Doh village in December 2021]?
When the fighting happened [between the State Administration Council (SAC)[3] and the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[4]], I was in P’Loo Hpa Doh village and then I was displaced to Ler Khaw village [in Thailand] right now., Do you remember the date of the incident [involving your nephew]?
I do not remember exactly. I think the incident was on March 19th 2022., The incident took place in P’Loo Hpa Doh village, right?
Yes, the incident took place in P’Loo Hpa Doh village., Do you remember the time when he [the victim] got injured?
He was injured at 1:00 in the afternoon., Was he injured from the shelling or other causes?
I did not witness it myself so I am not sure whether he was injured when touching an unexploded mortar shell or during the shelling. When people heard the explosion, they went to check and saw him injured already., Did anyone witness it?
No one witnessed how he was wounded., Did fighting happen in the area at the time of the incident [the shelling that killed your nephew]?
On the day [that the victim was killed, March 19th 2022], fighting took place in the Myawaddy Town area and Lay Kay Kaw area [over five kilometres from P’Loo Hpa Doh village]. There was no fighting in P’Loo Hpa Doh village [only air strikes and indiscriminate shelling]., What was the name of your nephew who got injured by the explosion?
His name was Say Kyay Wah., How old was he?
He was 16 years old., Was he a student?
Yes. However, the school was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic and he was not able to attend school since then., Was he single?
Yes., Did he live in P’Loo Hpa Doh village?
Yes. When we were displaced [to the Thai border], he regularly went back to P’Loo Hpa Doh village and took care of the household property so that nothing got stolen. He stayed at the K’Chaw Wah Lay IDP site [just an informal, temporary set up for IDPs who fled there] near P’Loo Hpa Doh area, Kaw T’Ree Township and sometimes he came to stay with me in Ler Khaw village [Thailand]. The incident happened to him without any witnesses on the day he went back to visit P’Loo Hpa Doh village., Were you displaced due to the fighting [in December 2021]?
Yes, we were displaced., When did you start fleeing?
I started to flee on the day when the fighting broke out in P’Loo Hpa Doh village [on December 19th 2021].[5], How long had you been displaced when the incident happened to your nephew?
The incident happened to him around three months after fleeing., You mentioned that he [the victim] was displaced to K’Chaw Wah Lay village. Is that right?
Yes, his father lived in K’Chaw Wah Lay village. When we were displaced, he sometimes visited his father and sometimes he stayed with me. He [the victim] always stayed with me in P’Loo Hpa Doh village before we were displaced., Did other villagers also flee?
Yes, all villagers [over 3,000 people in total][6] from P’Loo Hpa Doh viilage fled because the village was attacked [on December 19th 2021 by the SAC, followed by ongoing sporadic fighting with the KNLA and shelling][7]. We ran during the firing [of mortar shells]., Do you often go back and check on your village since you fled?
Yes, we [villagers] go back and forth. At that time [since we fled in December 2021], we went back to the village every 15 days or once a month. I went back two or three times but now, I do not dare to go back anymore as the road is restricted [likely by the Karen National Union (KNU)[8] or KNLA to protect villagers from the frequent shelling and fighting]. My nephew mostly stayed with me [in Thailand] and sometimes visited his father and also went back to P’Loo Hpa Doh village. On the day when he went back to the village, we were informed by phone that he was hit. He lost one hand and his whole face was destroyed., Where was he injured?
His whole chest and his legs were destroyed. His whole face was terribly injured and he also lost one hand., Was he still alive when people saw him?
He still had shortness of breath [was still breathing] when people saw him. One of his friends found him injured and called for help from nearby [KNLA] soldiers. When they [the soldiers] came to check, he had already passed away., Who informed you that he passed away?
The people who were in P’Loo Hpa Doh village phoned me and said that he passed away., Do you know which groups fired mortars into the village?
I am not sure which groups fired mortars into the village. [Several news sources have pointed to the SAC as being responsible for firing mortars into P’Loo Hpa Doh village on March 19th 2022 period.][9], What type of weapon was he hit by?
I heard that he was hit by a mortar shell. The air strikes happened two or three times by the time he went back [on the day he died]., Can you guess whether he was hit by air strikes or shelling?
I am not sure if it was an unexploded bomb dropped by fighter jets that exploded when he touched it, or if it was an unexploded mortar from shelling., What did the local villagers and KNLA soldiers say about the incident?
They assumed that he was injured when he touched an unexploded mortar shell which was fired by Bamar soldiers [the SAC]. However, no one witnessed it. His father said that the fragments [of the exploded mortar] were also stuck in the motorbike that he took along with him., Did the explosion also destroy his motorbike?
Yes, it hit the motorbike. The fragments hit the under part of the motorbike and the bike broke into a lot of small pieces., Where was the incident location?
It was just in front of the house next to my house., How about the house?
The house was not damaged by the explosion [that killed the victim]. The explosion was on the main road, which is a bit distant from the house., Who took his corpse away [for burial]?
The ambulance took his corpse and he was cremated [as Buddhist practice] on the same day. He [his body] was not kept for a day as the situation was unstable. The fighting was constantly taking place [through the time of the interview]., Did you hear anything from the soldiers [any armed groups], that is, how they described the situation related to the incident involving your nephew?
After the incident, I did not hear anything but the soldiers tried to clear the shrapnel [from the exploded mortar shells or bombs]., Was it the KNLA soldiers who cleared it up?
Yes, the KNLA cleared it. I am not sure whether the shells fired were from Karen [KNLA] or Bamar soldiers [SAC]. Unexploded ordnance was cleared by Karen soldiers and the villagers were not allowed to return to their village often since then because it was risky., How many shells landed in the village on that day?
There was one that exploded [immediately] and landed close to a house. Another mortar landed near another house, but it did not explode when it landed [and later hit the victim when it did explode]. We could not tell whether he [the boy] touched it or not [triggering the explosion]., Was there any damage to houses by the shelling?
The shelling damaged the rooftop of my house. The front wall of my sister’s house was destroyed., Were there any other houses damaged?
Yes, the other houses were also damaged. Some houses’ rooftops were wiped out and crumbled by the air strikes [three air strikes took place on March 19th]., You mentioned that all the villagers fled when the fighting happened, right?
Since we fled, we did not dare to go back as the Bamar soldiers [SAC] were in the village. But now, since the unexploded ordnance was cleared out and the Bamar soldiers [SAC] have gone, some villagers are going back to the village, especially the people who are single or do not have small kids. For families with small kids, they are not encouraged to return yet because if fighting happens, young kids/babies are more likely to get hurt., When did they start returning to the village?
It has only been ten days since villagers started returning to the village. We did not dare to stay in the village when air strikes were being conducted constantly. It was already terrifying to hear the explosion sounds from a distance. I do not dare to go back and I cannot do anything about this. Also, I cannot practice farming [likely from her current displacement location]., How do you stay in the place you were displaced?
I am staying at a friend’s house. I requested to stay temporarily at her home., Who is with you there?
I just stay with my mother, one kid [one of my children] and two of my nephews. My child is just two years old. For my husband, he is serving on the frontline. My nephew’s father has also been staying with me for a few days already., Did you get to bring any of your belongings with you?
No, I did not get to bring anything. All the plates and cooking pots were broken. Even if I go back, I have no more belongings., When was the last time you went back to check on your house?
It has been about 20 days already., What damage did you find at your house?
The rooftop was damaged and all the plates and cooking pots were destroyed by the air strikes. All the [other] belongings in the house were looted and dismantled. Nothing is useable. I do not dare to go back home much. As no one has stayed in the village [since December 2021], I also feel afraid., So the whole village might be isolated now.
The whole village has become very quiet and I’m also afraid of stepping on UXO [unexploded ordnance] as the leaves have covered up the ground surface. I’m afraid that risky things [landmines and UXO] have been planted., What armed groups are operating in the P’Loo Hpa Doh village area?
The Karen armed groups are based in the upper part of the village and the SAC army is based in the lower part of the village., When you say Karen armed groups, which groups are you referring to?
The Karen army base, which is close to my house, is General Zin Myint, Border Guard Force (BGF)[10] [battalion number not identified], and toward the other side of the river is Column Commander Bo[11] Sa Lone, Democratic Karen Benevolent Army (DKBA (Benevolent))[12] Headquarter operations area #1., Have there been any other incidents [injuries or causalities] similar to what happened to your nephew?
Yes, on another day [February 16th 2022], a man called P--- was hit by shrapnel [from a mortar shell] on his legs and his arm. He was seriously injured and both his legs broke.[13] [P--- has since been discharged from the hospital.] A 40-year-old woman was killed by the indiscriminate shelling on January 3rd 2022 when she returned to her home in P’Loo Hpa Doh village.[14] As far as I know, three people were hit and died [in P’Loo Hpa Doh village from January to April 2022], including my nephew. [The KHRG field researcher discovered that P--- survived his severe injuries, so only two villagers died between January and April]., How are you surviving for your living during displacement? What challenges are you facing?
The challenge is that I do not have any idea [about how to work here] so I struggle to earn a living. I just stay like this day by day. I do not have any work to get income., Do you have any support from others?
No, we had a little money with us when we were displaced and we used this money for food. As we stay longer, it is gone now but we cannot do anything., Where do you stay in Ler Khaw village?
I stay at the back of a village head’s house. When I first arrived after fleeing, I stayed in the monastery. Some of the displaced people joined the refugee group [a group headed to the refugee camp] but for us, we did not dare to join [the refugee camp], so we chose to stay in the house [homes of friends or family]., Do you receive any humanitarian aid for IDPs when you are living in someone’s house like that?
No, I do not receive it., **Would you like to express anything else related to the incident and your experiences? **
I just want to say that I don’t like to flee and stay in someone’s home like this. I want to stay peacefully with my family in my village. I feel sad that we had to flee and even my nephew had to give up his life. While living in another village, it is hard for us to survive for a living. That’s why I want to go back to my own place and stay in my own home peacefully. I wish that this fighting will be done soon., Further background reading on the security and human rights situation in Dooplaya District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, “Dooplaya District Incident Report: Killing of a civilian by unidentified assailant(s), May 2022”, August 2022., “Dooplaya District Incident Report: SAC shot at villagers, resulting in the death of two villagers in Kaw T’Ree Township, April 2022”, August 2022., “Dooplaya District Situation Update: Fighting, indiscriminate shelling, displacement, landmine injuries, travel restrictions and torture, December 2021 to February 2022”, June 2022., “Dooplaya District Situation Update: Killing, fighting, indiscriminate shelling, air strikes and displacement, March 2022”, May 2022.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/dooplaya-district-interview-16-year-old-boy-killed-mortar-explosion-following-sac-shelling-march-2022

Shelter and Non-Food Items",1 Nov 2022,"CONTEXT, Field reports from TBC’s partners in southeastern Myanmar documented the escalation of widespread and systematic attacks against civilian populations since the military coup. These attacks included military assaults on civilian settlements, fields, schools, churches and medical clinics. Roving Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) patrols committed murder, torture and rape of civilians suspected of supporting opposition groups. In 2022, the MAF seems to be increasingly resorting to air strikes and heavy artillery fire. This deliberate military strategy increases the indiscriminate nature of attacks putting more civilian lives at risk in violation of customary international law., Without a multi-lateral mandate to address the political causes of the complex emergency in Myanmar, UN international engagement with the State Administration Council (SAC) has focused on securing humanitarian access. However, there has not been proportionate engagement with other political stakeholders such as the National Unity Government and ethnic revolutionary forces., A review of the Humanitarian Response Plan’s (HRP’s) Mid-Year Report for 2022 indicates that 81% of food aid beneficiaries during the first half of 2022 were in urban areas of Yangon and Rakhine State. Only 16% of the HRP’s beneficiaries were internally displaced or stateless persons. In contrast, the most urgent needs were in rural areas where the MAF were targeting attacks against ethnic minorities. The SAC has deliberately obstructed multilateral aid from reaching displaced and conflict-affected communities in rural areas., Commonly reproduced estimates of internal displacement appear to grossly understate the scale and distribution of people forced to flee from their homes. UNHCR estimated that there are 274,000 IDPs in southeastern Myanmar in July 2022, whereas the Karen National Union estimate that there are 347,000 internally displaced Karen alone while the Karenni Civil Society Network estimates that 202,000 Karenni have been displaced since the military coup. Even discounting the Shan, Mon and other ethnic groups, these assessments of internal displacement amongst Karen and Karenni communities are double the official UN estimates., The ASEAN Humanitarian Agency's (AHA) lack of experience in responding to complex emergencies was highlighted when it agreed with the SAC to conduct a needs assessment in southeastern Myanmar. OCHA and the AHA Center then proceeded to approach relevant ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) about securing access but were rebuked for consulting too little and too late. The EAOs indicated they would be willing to engage with the AHA Center in planning assessments to be conducted by local civil society partners, but were not willing to allow SAC to instrumentalise militarisation under the guise of humanitarian aid. The AHA Center tried to go ahead with their plan regardless only for the missions to be suspended when local MAF authorities denied access into rural areas., More than 15,000 people crossed into Thailand during this period. All new arrivals, in accordance with Thai Policy, were denied official access to the existing nine refugee camps with many instead kept in tightly controlled “temporary safety areas” . Numerous protection issues have been raised regarding these “temporary safety areas” and their suitability for human habitation. Access to these areas has been tightly restricted, increasing the challenges of providing protection and humanitarian aid. Many new arrivals have been coerced to return, under the knowledge they will not be granted long term refuge in Thailand., 78,755 refugees remain in nine camps in Thailand. In these camps the COVID-19 vaccination programme continued and by the end of June 25,793 (33%) refugees over 18 had received at least one dose, with 23,277 (30%) refugees being fully vaccinated. During this reporting period there were 6,579 cumulative cases of COVID-19, with 43 deaths from COVID-19 related illness.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/border-consortium-mid-year-overview-january-june-2022

Shelter and Non-Food Items",1 Nov 2022,"1 November 2022 -- The number of children forced to flee their homes to escape violence in Myanmar has surpassed half a million with a rapid escalation in displacements this year, Save the Children said today., More than 1.4 million people have been displaced by conflict in Myanmar -- including 520,000 children -- with 1.1 million forced to flee since the beginning of the political crisis and escalation of violence in February 2021. Of the total 407,000 children displaced since then, about 63%, or 257,000 , have been displaced in the past nine months, The figures do not include the half a million Rohingya children who have been living in camps in neighbouring Bangladesh for more than five years., Many displaced families in Myanmar are living in makeshift shelters in the jungle and are vulnerable to hunger, illness and face risks to their safety like trafficking and exploitation. Despite the enormous level of need, Save the Children warned that the Myanmar crisis is one of the most underfunded humanitarian crises globally, and urged the international community to do more to protect Myanmar children., Daw Mar Lwin*, 35, and her four daughters were forced from their home in Sagaing Region, north-west Myanmar -- the area that has seen the highest number of displacements across the country -- eight months ago. They spent more than 25 days trekking through the jungle trying to find safety., She said: ""Our current shelter is made from tarpaulin and is too small for us. It is also difficult to get enough food for children here., ""We have been here for several months, and we are all so worried about food, nutrition, healthcare and education for my daughters. In all my life, I never imagined that I would be a refugee. I had to leave our home and village because of this unprecedented violence, and I have no idea when I will be able to go back."", Daniel*, 17, in a displacement camp in Kayah State, said: ""Because there are so many people in the camp, we usually face a shortage of clean water. We also do not have enough food., ""As for young people like us, it is as if we have lost our goals. I want to have the opportunity to continue my education and study without fear."", People living in these displacement camps are reliant on donations from local charity groups and humanitarian aid organisations to survive. Roadblocks and ever-tightening restrictions on transport and aid mean that access is often inconsistent, Save the Children said, which is having the effect of denying humanitarian aid to those in desperate need., Nearly two years after the escalation of violence in the country, children's lives remain under threat on a daily basis, Save the Children said. In September, 11 children were reportedly killed and another 17 children injured in an airstrike on a school in Sagaing Region. Last month, two children were killed and one was severely injured in an explosion on the way home from school in Chin State., Olivier Franchi, Save the Children's Asia Programmes Director, said: ""People don't just take the decision to leave their homes lightly -- this rapid escalation in children having to flee is down to the very real everyday threats to their lives from fighting in Myanmar., ""ASEAN Heads of State must use their upcoming November Leaders' Summit, to come up with a concrete plan of action to resolve the crisis in Myanmar. We are urging the UN Security Council to hold an open meeting on Myanmar and to urgently pass a strong resolution to protect the rights of children. We also need the international community to rapidly stepup funding to what is one of the most under-funded humanitarian responses globally., ""A year after this political crisis and escalation in violence started, 150,000 children were displaced. Not even a year after that, this number is at half a million. These figures serve as a warning to the world: while there are many crises the world is grappling with, the children of Myanmar must not be forgotten."", Save the Children has been working in Myanmar since 1995, providing life-saving healthcare, food and nutrition, education and child protection programmes with more than 50 partners across the country. We are actively engaging with our partners and with Myanmar communities in protecting children and responding to their needs in this time of crisis., ENDS, *names have been changed to protect anonymity, [i] 1.4 million people are internally displaced in Myanmar, with 1.1 million since the political crisis and escalation of violence in February 2021.

ASEAN: Act to Stop Myanmar Military Abuses,News and Press Release,HRW,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",1 Nov 2022,"Concerned Governments Should Support Targeted Sanctions, Arms Embargo, (New York) – Governments attending summits in Asia in November 2022 should support tougher sanctions and other measures to address widespread abuses by Myanmar’s military, Human Rights Watch said today. Governments should agree on new measures to cut off the Myanmar junta’s foreign currency revenues and impose embargos on arms and aviation fuel., The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will meet November 10-13 in Cambodia for the ASEAN Summit and side meetings with the United States, the European Union, Japan, and other dialogue partners. The summit will be followed by a G20 leaders meeting in Indonesia and a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group the following week., “Myanmar’s military is committing atrocities while ASEAN countries and others just stand on the sidelines,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “It’s not enough to condemn the junta and hope it will change its conduct or move toward democracy: stronger actions are needed.”, Human Rights Watch has found that the junta’s widespread and systematic abuses since the February 2021 coup – including extrajudicial killings, torture, and wrongful imprisonment – amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes. Junta authorities have also severely cracked down on the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly., ASEAN members and like-minded G20 and APEC leaders should agree on a stronger message to send to the Myanmar junta on consequences for ongoing rights violations. Sanctions should be tied to clear benchmarks, including the release of political prisoners, a cessation of attacks on civilians, and steps toward the establishment of civilian democratic rule, among other actions., At a previous summit in Jakarta on April 24, 2021, nine ASEAN leaders and Myanmar’s junta chief, Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, agreed to a “five point consensus”: an immediate end to violence in the country; dialogue among all parties; the appointment of a special envoy; humanitarian assistance by ASEAN; and a visit by the special envoy to Myanmar to meet with all parties. Days later, the junta called the consensus “suggestions” and in the year and a half since, Min Aung Hlaing has defied almost every point in the agreement while overseeing a brutal nationwide crackdown aimed at suppressing the millions of people in Myanmar who oppose military rule., An October European Parliament resolution noted that “the Five-Point Consensus has not led to any results and calls on ASEAN to acknowledge that Min Aung Hlaing’s junta is not a reliable partner; urges ASEAN and its members to negotiate a new agreement on the crisis in Myanmar with the NUG [National Unity Government, a civilian structure] and to provide that new agreement with enforcement mechanisms, with a view to achieving a sustainable, democratic resolution of the crisis in the future.”, Several ASEAN countries, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore, have acknowledged the failure of the agreement. Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob, in an address before the UN General Assembly in September, noted that “Malaysia is disappointed that there is no meaningful progress in the implementation of the ASEAN ‘Five Point Consensus’ … In its current form, the ASEAN ‘Five Point Consensus’ cannot continue any longer.” A new “refined” agreement, he said, should be reached “based on a clearer framework, timeframe and end goal.”, Like-minded ASEAN members should lead the bloc toward an overhaul of its approach, Human Rights Watch said. ASEAN has already barred junta representatives from high-level meetings, noting at the August Foreign Ministers’ Meeting that they were “deeply disappointed by the limited progress in and lack of commitment of the Nay Pyi Taw authorities.”, The ministers committed to assessing Myanmar’s progress on the consensus to guide the bloc’s next steps, “consistent with Article 20 of the ASEAN Charter,” which provides for serious breaches of the Charter or noncompliance. As part of its review, ASEAN should consider suspending Myanmar to uphold the bloc’s commitment to a “people-oriented, people-centered ASEAN,” Human Rights Watch said., ASEAN leaders should also signal their support for a UN Security Council resolution imposing a global arms embargo on Myanmar, which purchases weapons from both China and Russia., ASEAN should also signal support for stronger enforcement of economic measures targeting the junta’s revenues, much of which are paid or held in US, British, and EU currencies., Since the coup, the US, EU, and several other governments have imposed rounds of targeted sanctions on the Myanmar military and military-owned businesses. In February, the EU adopted new sanctions against Myanmar’s military-owned Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), but the US and United Kingdom have not followed suit., The US and UK governments have also not pursued stronger actions at the UN. In October, the UK government began distributing drafts of a resolution on Myanmar among members of the UN Security Council, but they and other supportive members have not advanced debate on it in the face of certain opposition by the governments of Russia and China. Min Aung Hlaing has visited Russia three times since the coup and Russia has increased exports to Myanmar of military aircraft, fuel, and weapons., Some foreign officials have contended in meetings with Human Rights Watch that US and EU sanctions on the military are ineffectual and have not affected the junta’s actions. But the sanctions imposed so far have primarily targeted domestic businesses controlled by the junta inside the country and revenues collected and held in Myanmar banks, which are beyond the reach of outside sanctions. Hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign revenues from natural gas and mining continue to flow into the junta’s bank accounts, including from Thailand and China and via companies in Malaysia, Singapore, and other ASEAN countries., Chinese companies in particular, including state-owned companies, have continued to purchase hundreds of millions of dollars of gas, metals, and precious stones and gems. The junta can use these foreign revenues to buy arms, materiel, and aviation fuel to carry out unlawful attacks during military operations., ASEAN governments should support the sanctions, help enforce them, and use their interactions with the junta to communicate the steps they need to take to have them eased. Thailand’s government, which is closer to Myanmar diplomatically and economically, is especially important in this regard. ASEAN and its dialogue partners, as well as G20 members meeting after ASEAN, should also agree to enforce other economic restrictions more rigorously, including anti-money laundering laws, on bank accounts controlled by the junta. Myanmar military-controlled entities hold foreign currency accounts in banks in Singapore and Thailand, among other locations., “The effectiveness of sanctions against Myanmar’s junta shouldn’t be judged until strong international sanctions are in place,” Pearson said. “Concerned governments need to cut off the junta from all funds being used to commit human rights abuses.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/asean-act-stop-myanmar-military-abuses

The next humanitarian update will be issued at the end of November 2022., HIGHLIGHTS & KEY MESSAGES, • Ongoing hostilities across Myanmar continue to endanger safety of civilians. More than 1.4 million people have been displaced across the country, of whom more than 1.1 million were displaced since the 2021 military takeover., • Ongoing conflict and inflation in the costs of basic commodities continue to compromise the food security of Myanmar people. An estimated 15.2 million people are now severely and moderately food insecure., • Humanitarian partners continue to respond to the critical needs of affected and displaced people, reaching 3.1m people in the first half of the year and are continuing to scale-up and expand in newly affected areas., • Food security partners have expanded presence and operations in the Northwest and Southeast. As of end of August, partners had provided food assistance to 626,000 IDPs, exceeding the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) target., • In central Rakhine, WASH partners provided critical WASH supplies to 91 out of 119 sites for IDPs from previous Arakan Army (AA) -Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) conflict, reaching more than 42,000 IDPs during September 2022., • The 2022 HRP remains drastically underfunded with less support received so far in 2022 than at the same time in 2021, despite the dramatic surge in needs and inflation., • As of 27 October, the HRP is only 22 per cent funded, leaving a gap of US$643 million (FTS). Consequently, partners are being forced to prioritize assistance to people in most need and there are shortages of stocks in some parts of the country., KEY FIGURES*, 1.4M People internally displaced across Myanmar, 1.1M People currently displaced by clashes and insecurity since February 2021, 330K People internally displaced due to conflict prior to February 2021, mainly in Rakhine, Kachin, Chin, and Shan, 30.2K Civilian properties estimated to have been burnt or destroyed since February 2021., *Displacement figures fluctuate during any given month. These figures represent the number of people currently displaced. Cumulative numbers for returns and displacement are not always available., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Ongoing hostilities across Myanmar continue to endanger the lives, safety, mental health and livelihoods of civilians. Heavy armed clashes, including airstrikes, artillery fire and ambushes were reported predominantly in the northwest and southeast of the country, as well as in Rakhine and southern Chin. The surge in displacement continues, with more than 1.4 million people remain internally displaced across the country, of whom more than 1.1 million fled their homes since the 2021 military takeover., Inflation continues to drive increases in the cost of basic commodities. Combined with ongoing fighting, thisputs affected and displaced people at tremendous security and protection risk and is compromising their food security. According to the World Food Program (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 15.2 million people are now severely and moderately food insecure. This multi-dimensional crisis is forcing people to adopt negative coping mechanisms, including lowering food intake, selling of assets, dropping out of school and early marriage, Humanitarian partners continue to respond to emerging humanitarian needs, providing food, shelter, health, water and sanitation, education and protection services to affected and displaced people across the country. During the first half of 2022, 3.1 million people were reached and provided with critical and lifesaving assistance. Humanitarian partners continue to scale-up and expand in newly affected areas. For instance, food security partners have expanded their presence and operations in the Northwest and Southeast. As of end of August, partners have provided food assistance to 626,000 IDPs, exceeding the HRP target. In central Rakhine, WASH partners provided critical supplies to 91 out of 119 pre-existing AA-MAF displacement sites, reaching more than 42,000 IDPs during September 2022. Furthermore, in early October, an inter-agency multi-sectoral distribution mission was conducted in four townships in southern Shan. More than 1,600 displaced households (6,200 IDPs) were provided with humanitarian assistance based on a previous assessment., Despite these operational efforts, access constraints continue to prevent partners from accessing many areas including some locations where people have the most urgent need for lifesaving assistance and protection. A shortfall in funding is undermining efforts to respond in areas where there is access. This has stopped partners from delivering the full range of relief required by affected people in a consistent manner, which in turn has resulted in significant unmet needs. According to FTS, as of 27 October, the Humanitarian Response Plan is only 22 per cent funded, leaving a gap of US$643 million.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-update-no-23-31-october-2022

Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Myanmar Noeleen Heyzer: United Nations General Assembly Third Committee (25 October 2022),News and Press Release,UN,Protection and Human Rights,25 Oct 2022,"Distinguished Delegates,, I appreciate the opportunity to introduce the Report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Myanmar, as well as update on recent events., As the Report details, the political, human rights and humanitarian crisis in Myanmar continues to take a catastrophic toll on the people, with serious regional implications., More than 13.2 million people are food insecure, about 40 percent of the population is living below the poverty line and 1.3 million are internally displaced., Military operations continue with disproportionate use of force including aerial bombings, burning of civilian structures, and the killing of civilians including children. I condemn the indiscriminate airstrikes on a celebration in Kachin State that killed large numbers of civilians days ago. The People’s Defence Forces are also accused of targeting civilians., The plight of the Rohingya people, along with other forcefully displaced communities, remains desperate, with many seeking refuge through dangerous land and sea journeys., The price of impunity is a grave reminder that accountability remains essential., Since the release of the report, violence between the Arakan Army and the military in Rakhine has escalated to levels not seen since late 2020, with significant cross-border incursions, endangering all communities, harming conditions for durable return, and prolonging the burden on Bangladesh as host of about 1 million Rohingya refugees., As the Myanmar crisis deepens, I continue to promote a coordinated international strategy, in line with my mandate, engaging all stakeholders for an inclusive Myanmar-led process to return to the democratic transition., My first visit to Myanmar as Special Envoy in August to meet the military’s Commander-in-Chief was part of broader efforts by the UN to urgently support a return to civilian rule based on the will and needs of the people. I made six requests during the visit: ending aerial bombing and burning of civilian infrastructure; delivery of humanitarian assistance without discrimination; the release of all children and political prisoners; a moratorium on executions; the well-being of and engagement with State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. I also highlighted Myanmar’s responsibility for creating conducive conditions for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of Rohingya refugees., Soon after, I visited Dhaka and Cox’s Bazar on the five-year anniversary of the Rohingya’s mass displacement, where I expressed the United Nations’ appreciation for Bangladesh’s generosity and heeded Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s statements that the current situation is unsustainable., A highlight of the visit was my discussions with women and youth in the refugee camps. They made it clear that they need to be engaged directly in discussions and decisions about their future. Their rights and protection, in particular their citizenship, freedom of movement and security, must be guaranteed, guided by the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State., Going forward, I will continue to strengthen co-operation with ASEAN and engagement with all stakeholders. While there is little room for the de-escalation of violence or for “talks about talks” in the present zero-sum situation, there are some concrete ways to reducing the suffering of the people., Recognizing that many more people will be forced to flee the violence, I will continue to urge ASEAN to develop a regional protection framework for refugees and forcefully displaced persons. The recent forced return of Myanmar nationals, some of whom were detained on arrival, underlines the urgency of a coordinated ASEAN response to address shared regional challenges caused by the conflict., Education and skills development are powerful tools to prepare Rohingya refugees for their return to Myanmar, which I continue to advocate, working closely with leaders of ASEAN and neighbouring countries as well as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation., Key Ethnic Armed Organizations and the National Unity Government have together appealed for me to convene an Inclusive Forum for engagement to facilitate protection and humanitarian assistance to ALL people in need, in observance of International Humanitarian Law., I have also initiated a women, peace and security (WPS) platform on Myanmar with the Foreign Minister of Indonesia to amplify the needs of women affected by the conflict, and their leadership as agents of change., To conclude, there is a new political reality in Myanmar: a people demanding change, no longer willing to accept military rule. I will continue to appeal to all governments and other key stakeholders to listen to the people and be guided by their will to prevent deeper catastrophe in the heart of Asia., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/special-envoy-secretary-general-myanmar-noeleen-heyzer-united-nations-general-assembly-third-committee-25-october-2022
ASEAN Ministers Hold Emergency Myanmar Meeting,News and Press Release,HRW,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",26 Oct 2022,"Region’s Leaders Should Commit to Protecting Asylum Seekers, Shayna Bauchner
Researcher, Asia Division, Southeast Asian foreign ministers are meeting today in Jakarta, Indonesia, to discuss the most pressing crisis facing the region: Myanmar., Last April, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) adopted a “five-point consensus” in response to the February 2021 military coup in Myanmar, an ASEAN member. Since then, Myanmar junta chief Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing has defied each point while overseeing crimes against humanity and war crimes by security forces. Just this week, a junta airstrike unlawfully killed at least 60 people at a music concert in Kachin State., Today’s discussion, taking place ahead of the ASEAN summit in November, should address how the bloc can revamp its approach to support international efforts to restrict the junta’s access to foreign revenue and arms., In August, the ASEAN ministers noted they were “deeply disappointed by the limited progress in and lack of commitment” of junta authorities and committed to assessing next steps “consistent with Article 20 of the ASEAN Charter,” which covers serious breaches of the charter or noncompliance., But the foreign ministers should also look beyond influencing the crisis within Myanmar’s borders. As military atrocities continue, growing numbers of Myanmar refugees are seeking asylum throughout the region. An estimated 70,000 have fled to neighboring countries since the coup. Yet rather than protecting asylum seekers from the junta’s violence and persecution, regional actors are forcing Myanmar refugees and other nationals back into harm’s way., Malaysian authorities have accelerated deportations to Myanmar, returning over 2,000 people since April without allowing the United Nations refugee agency to assess their asylum claims. Thai authorities have similarly pushed asylum seekers back across the Myanmar border without verifying their protection needs. And last week at the 90th General Assembly of Interpol, the international criminal police organization, the junta’s police chief requested that Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand hand over any “terrorists” – its label for all opponents of military rule., The ASEAN chair noted in a statement yesterday that “ASEAN is gravely concerned over the recent escalation of violence in Myanmar” and “deeply saddened by the … immense suffering that ordinary people in Myanmar have endured.”, Recognizing the grave abuses the junta has unleashed on Myanmar’s people is only step one. Southeast Asian leaders also need to ensure their own governments don’t force people back to suffer under the brutality they managed to flee.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/asean-ministers-hold-emergency-myanmar-meeting

Some 1,200 people went to Bilin Township while 6,600 were displaced to Shwegyin Township in Bago Region (East). Among those displaced to Shwegyin were 1,100 IDPs who were already displaced across Mon State., In Tanintharyi Region, nine villages in Myeik Township were affected by shelling which forced 960 villagers to flee to Myeik town and the surrounding jungle. Similar clashes in Tanintharyi Township also caused the displacement of 200 people into the jungle. However, 2,900 IDPs in Tanintharyi town managed to return to their village of origin within the township., More returns were also verified in Shan State (south), 710 IDPs returned to Moe Bye town, Pekon Township.

A non-political representative from Myanmar was invited to the Meeting; however, the invitation was met with no positive response., The Meeting exchanged extensive views on how to further strengthen the implementation of the 5PC to help solve Myanmar’s crisis, the need to resume Myanmar’s full and normal engagements with ASEAN, the importance of continuing ASEAN community building efforts without disruption, and the ways to facilitate and expedite the delivery of the humanitarian assistance to the people of Myanmar and the early conclusion of the Joint Needs Assessment led by the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre)., While reaffirming the importance of the 5PC, which emphasized ASEAN Centrality and ASEAN’s leading role in returning peace and normalcy for the people of Myanmar, the Ministers and representatives reiterated full support for the tireless efforts of Cambodia as the Chair of ASEAN and H.E. Deputy Prime Minister as the Special Envoy of the ASEAN Chair on Myanmar in carrying out the mandate over the past ten months., The Meeting also recalled the ice-breaking visit of Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen, Prime Minister of Cambodia, to Myanmar, which paved the way for the two subsequent visits of the Special Envoy. H.E. Deputy Prime Minister stressed that he remains strongly committed to advance the three priorities that Cambodia has set out since the beginning of her Chairmanship, namely (1) end or reduce violence, (2) facilitate humanitarian assistance delivery and (3) create an enabling environment for political dialogue among all parties concerned., Undoubtedly, the situation on the ground remains critical and fragile, and this is not due to the lack of commitments and efforts on the part of ASEAN and the Special Envoy, but because of the complexity and difficulty of Myanmar’s decades-long protracted conflicts, which has been further exacerbated by the current political crisis. Despite these great challenges, the Meeting agreed that ASEAN should not be discouraged, but even more determined to help Myanmar to bring about a peaceful solution the soonest possible., Furthermore, the Meeting unanimously agreed that decision-making in ASEAN shall be based on consultation and consensus, and the fundamental principles stipulated in the ASEAN Charter shall guide ASEAN’s collective efforts to address the situation in Myanmar. Foreign Ministers and Representatives also reaffirmed the importance and relevance of the 5PC, and underscored the need to further strengthen its implementation through concrete, practical and time-bound actions., H.E. Deputy Prime Minister emphasized that the time to act is now, and ASEAN needs to act together with respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and the interests of the people of Myanmar at the core. The Meeting also acknowledged that all concerned parties in Myanmar have a stake in ending or worsening the current political crisis that has caused the loss of many lives, severe destruction to the country, and long-lasting effects on the economy, and it is of utmost necessity and urgency that a dialogue process shall commence the soonest possible., In order to ensure full and effective implementation of the Five-Point Consensus and an early conclusion of the current political crisis in Myanmar, the Meeting has also discussed about key recommendations to be submitted for the consideration of the ASEAN Leaders at the upcoming 40th and 41st ASEAN Summits in November 2022., Jakarta, 27 October 2022",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/statement-chair-special-asean-foreign-ministers-meeting-27-october-2022-asean-secretariat-jakarta

"Atrocity Alert No. 323: Myanmar (Burma), Sudan and Democratic Republic of the Congo",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,26 Oct 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., MILITARY AIRSTRIKE KILLED AT LEAST 80 PEOPLE IN MYANMAR’S KACHIN STATE, On 23 October Myanmar’s (Burma) military – the Tatmadaw – bombed a concert in Hpakant Township, Kachin State, killing at least 80 people and injuring over 100 in what appeared to be the single-worst air attack since the February 2021 coup. The Tatmadaw launched airstrikes on a musical performance, which was organized by the opposition Kachin Independence Organization as part of a three-day celebration commemorating the organization’s 62nd anniversary. The concert was held at a base also used for military training by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), the organization’s armed wing. The airstrike on hundreds of concertgoers likely amounts to a war crime as International Humanitarian Law prohibits attacks that result in indiscriminate or disproportionate civilian harm., The attack was widely condemned by the international community. The UN Office in Myanmar stressed, “What would appear to be excessive and disproportionate use of force by security forces against unarmed civilians is unacceptable and those responsible must be held to account.” Envoys representing diplomatic missions in Myanmar, including Australia, the United Kingdom, United States and European Union, issued a joint statement saying that the attack “underscores the military regime’s responsibility for crisis and instability in Myanmar and the region and its disregard for its obligation to protect civilians and respect the principles and rules of international humanitarian law.” The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, questioned, “How many atrocities will it take for the world to cut off the junta’s capacity to commit these horrific acts?”, There have been rebellions by ethnic minority groups seeking independence in Myanmar for decades. Notably, the KIA – one of the stronger ethnic armed groups – have clashed regularly with the Tatmadaw. Following last year’s military coup, anti-government resistance significantly increased across the country, with armed pro-democracy movements and ethnic armed groups clashing with the Tatmadaw. Since the coup, the Tatmadaw has targeted civilian areas with airstrikes, scorched earth campaigns and other attacks, particularly in opposition strongholds. This latest deadly bombing underscores how the military has increasingly turned to air attacks as it struggles to control the country., Tomorrow, 27 October, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will hold a special meeting on Myanmar to consider the peace process. ASEAN must move beyond the ineffective “Five-Point Consensus” and take more substantial action to protect Myanmar’s people. In light of the military’s escalating repression, the international community must block the sale of arms and aviation fuel to Myanmar to hinder the military’s capacity to perpetrate atrocities. The UN Security Council should urgently consider imposing an arms embargo on Myanmar and targeted sanctions on military officials and the country’s oil and gas sector., HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE KILLED IN RENEWED INTER-COMMUNAL VIOLENCE IN SUDAN, Fighting between the Hausa and Berti communities in Blue Nile State, Sudan, erupted earlier this month following a dispute over land ownership. The situation escalated further on 19 and 20 October in Wad al Mahi locality and, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, unconfirmed reports indicate that an estimated 250 people were killed, 572 injured and 7,000 displaced. On 20 October the UN Humanitarian Coordinator ad interim, Eddie Rowe, expressed deep concern and warned that there is “a risk of an escalation and spread of the fighting with additional humanitarian consequences.”, The fighting in Wad al Mahi stems from violent clashes earlier in July between the Hausa and Berti communities in Ar Rusyaris locality, Blue Nile State, when 149 people were killed. The clashes erupted following the rejection of a Hausa request to create a “civil authority to supervise access to land.” While troops were deployed to the area to restore stability, Sudan’s military and ex-rebel leaders have been accused of exploiting inter-communal tensions for personal gain. The ongoing situation marks one of the deadliest episodes of inter-communal violence in Blue Nile State in recent years., Inter-communal violence in the Blue Nile, Darfur and Kordofan regions has dramatically increased since the military launched a coup in Sudan one year ago. Political instability and the re-deployment of security forces to Khartoum and other cities has created a security vacuum in Darfur and other peripheral regions, leaving communities vulnerable to attack and enabling the resurgence of inter-communal violence., The political crisis in Sudan has continued since the 25 October 2021 coup, with weekly mass demonstrations taking place across the country. Sudanese security forces have used excessive and deadly force in response to the protests, killing at least 118 people and injuring hundreds of others. Protesters have also been subjected to sexual and gender-based violence – including abuse and gang rape – tortured, arbitrarily arrested and forcibly disappeared. On Tuesday, the one year anniversary of the coup, a group of UN human rights experts emphasized that, “If these atrocities are not addressed, if victims are once again denied justice and reparations, and if the voices of protesters are not heard, Sudan’s cycle of political turmoil and brutal repression will continue.”, The Sudanese authorities must urgently implement the National Plan for the Protection of Civilians and all provisions of the Juba Peace Agreement to provide safety and security for civilians in the Blue Nile, Darfur and Kordofan regions and advance peacebuilding efforts. The Sudanese authorities must also engage constructively in ongoing political negotiations and work toward establishing a civilian-led transition that respects the people’s desire for democracy., VIOLENT CLASHES RESUME BETWEEN DR CONGO ARMY AND M23 ARMED GROUP, After several weeks of relative calm, on 20 October intense clashes renewed between the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s (DRC) army (FARDC) and fighters from the armed group, March 23 Movement (M23), in Rutshuru Territory, North Kivu Province. The unrest initially broke out in Rangira locality then spread to other villages in the Jomba group, as well as the Bweza and Busanza groups, near the borders of Uganda and Rwanda. Since the resumption of fighting, there have been reports of the use of heavy weapons and explosive weapons, including mortar fire and artillery shelling. The explosion of a shell dropped by M23 reportedly hit a market in Rangira on 22 October. At least four civilians have been killed and 40 injured, including children, by the violence in Rutshuru so far., On 23 October M23 fighters reportedly captured Ntamugenga village. In a statement the FARDC indicated that troops continue to fight the armed group, adding that civilian casualties have occurred in the area. As the clashes have escalated in Ntamugenga, an estimated 500 people, some of them injured, have sought shelter in a convent in the village. The majority of inhabitants in neighboring villages have been forced to flee due to gunfire. At least 34,500 people are estimated to have been displaced since 20 October, including 6,500 people who have fled to Uganda. According to the UN Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the escalation in hostilities will impede humanitarian access to vulnerable populations across Rutshuru., Since the resurgence of M23, civilians and critical civilian infrastructure, such as schools and health centers, have faced increased risk due to the use of explosive weapons, including mortar fire and artillery shelling, by the FARDC and M23. Over the past year, M23 has committed widespread abuses against civilians, including deliberate killings and indiscriminate shelling, among other possible war crimes. Human Rights Watch has also documented myriad abuses perpetrated by local armed groups backed by FARDC units and at times by FARDC soldiers, including unlawful killings, sexual violence and theft, during their fight against M23., Christine Caldera, DRC expert at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “The latest resumption in fighting is having devastating consequences for the civilians caught in the middle. All parties to the conflict should minimize civilian harm during clashes and uphold their obligations under International Humanitarian Law, including restricting the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas.” The DRC government should implement a vetting process within the FARDC and other security services to identify and provisionally remove individuals who may have been implicated in serious human rights violations while cases are pending. A humanitarian corridor should be urgently established in Ntamugenga to evacuate civilians and those injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-323-myanmar-burma-sudan-and-democratic-republic-congo

"Over 80 killed in airstrike on a concert in Hpakant, Myanmar, 24 Oct",News and Press Release,AOAV,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",25 Oct 2022,"By Chiara Torelli on 25 Oct 2022, In what is believed to be the single deadliest air strike since the coup in February 2021, military jets attacked Kachin state’s Kansi village on 24 October, during a concert commemorating the 62nd anniversary of the founding of the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO)., At least 80 people were killed and around 100 injured, including civilians, artists, and members of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), when three jets targeted the event on Monday evening. Around 300 to 500 people were in attendance, and the casualty toll is expected to keep rising., Radio Free Asia reports that junta forces then blocked access to the road leading to the impact site, impeding aid and relief groups from reaching the victims., Since the coup in 2021, the military junta has faced staunch resistance from Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs), civilian defense groups, and People’s Defence Forces affiliated with the shadow National Unity Government (NUG), becoming entrenched in protracted armed conflicts in many of Myanmar’s regions., Since 2021, AOAV has recorded 467 incidents of intentional explosive weapon use in Myanmar, resulting in 1,211 reported civilian casualties (473 killed, 738 injured). The most affected regions are Sagaing (267 civilian casualties), Kachin (223), Shan (128), and Karen (125)., In that time, ground-launched weapons have reportedly caused 46% (557) of civilian casualties, air-launched weapons have caused 28% (344), and IEDs 9% (109)., State actors have been the reported perpetrators in the case of 83% (462) of recorded civilian casualties of ground-launched weapons, 100% of recorded civilian casualties of air-launched weapons, and 100% (119) of recorded civilian casualties of combined explosive weapons.

Protection and Human Rights",25 Oct 2022,"SEVENTY-SEVENTH SESSION, 31ST & 32ND MEETINGS (AM & PM), GA/SHC/4358, Delegates Stress Need to End Violence, including Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, Speakers highlighted the need for democratic rule in Myanmar, an end to extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, as the Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) continued its interactive dialogues on human rights., One of seven experts and mandate holders briefing the Committee, Noeleen Heyzer, Special Envoy of the Secretary‑General on Myanmar, stressed the catastrophic toll and severe impact the crisis in that country is having on its people. “Military operations continue with disproportionate use of force in Myanmar, including aerial bombings, burning of civilian structures, and the killing of civilians, including children”, she said., People in Myanmar are no longer willing to accept military rule, she continued emphasizing the need for an inclusive process to lead Myanmar back to democracy. Outlining vital measures to be taken, she said they include an end to aerial bombing and burning of civilian infrastructure and delivery of humanitarian assistance without discrimination. The military must also release children and political prisoners, end summary executions and ensure the well‑being of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. In a similar vein, Morris Tidball-Binz, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, presented a report on that topic (A/77/270), noting that such practises are witnessed globally. Urging concerned nations to investigate all cases, he called on States to avoid the excessive use of force, potentially resulting in the loss of lives, as recommended in his mandate., During the ensuing interactive dialogue, the representative of Myanmar condemned summary executions committed by the illegal military, underlining the total lack of trial standards and due process, torture of detainees and arbitrary killings., The representative of Armenia, pointing to the execution of a group of unarmed Armenian servicemen, called for a reliable investigative mechanism. Also stressing the need for independent investigations, the representative of Mexico spotlighted the need for protection of prisoners in extraditions to countries where a crime is punished by death., Also addressing the Committee, Fionnuala Ní Aoláin, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, expressed concern that States engage in peace work through a terrorism, rather than peace, lens. This displaces international legal frameworks and undermines grassroot participation, she said, adding that counter‑terrorism requires compromise, including by working with actors who have previously engaged in violence., In the ensuing interactive dialogue, the representative of Pakistan said that an unclear definition of terrorism has failed to distinguish between terrorism and self-determination, freedom of assembly and minority rights. Further, she expressed concern that, since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, terrorism is unjustly associated with Islam., The representative of Cuba asked what States could do to bring the United States to justice for its so‑called War on Terror, which resulted in extrajudicial killings and Guantanamo Bay prison, where 39 people are still arbitrarily detained. Responding, the representative of the United States said that the Government is currently making a transparent effort to transfer prisoners and close the Guantanamo Bay prison., Also briefing the Third Committee today was Nazila Ghanea, Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief; Livingstone Sewanyana, Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order; Fernanda Hopenhaym, Chair of the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises; and Attiya Waris, Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights., The Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 26 October, to continue its consideration of human rights., Interactive Dialogues: Freedom of Religion, NAZILA GHANEA, Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, presenting the report of her predecessor, Ahmed Shaheed, on Indigenous Peoples’ rights under that topic (document A/77/514), noted that they comprise 476 million people worldwide. Indigenous peoples belong to over 5,000 groups, live in 90 countries, speak over 4,000 languages, and own, occupy or manage over one‑quarter of the world's land, yet only enjoy secure tenure of 10 per cent of that land, she said. Stressing that they experience severe and systemic discrimination, hostility, and violence at the hands of both State and non‑State actors, she noted that they make up just 6 per cent of the global population, but account for some 19 per cent of the extreme poor. Further, the report details the obstacles they face in enjoying their right to freedom of religion or belief, stressing that they face State restrictions on their spiritual ceremonies, symbols and leaders. Noting that indigenous peoples are often disproportionately vulnerable to environmental crises and experience intersectional barriers, she pointed to the vulnerability of indigenous women to trafficking, sexual and gender‑based violence, and harmful practices. Highlighting the report’s recommendations to States and other key stakeholders to better protect the right to freedom of religion or belief by indigenous peoples, she said that States should develop holistic and human rights‑based solutions, facilitate access to ancestral territories and uphold the requirement of the free, prior, and informed consent of Indigenous Peoples in every measure that affects them. Turning to priorities for her mandate, she noted that freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief is often a poorly understood, violated and distorted right. The mandate will focus on entering into dialogue with States through received communications and welcome meetings to address issues, calling for technical assistance, she said., The representative of the United States expressed concern over increasing anti‑semitism, anti‑Muslim discrimination, attacks on Christians and other religious groups. Adding that promoting accountability for all those committing violations against freedom of religion and belief is key, she called on China to immediately end atrocities against the Uyghurs and mistreatment of Tibetan Buddhists. Stressing the importance of practicing religion without harassment, she condemned the killing of peaceful protests against the mandatory religious headscarf. She asked how multilateral institutions can better protect freedom of religion or beliefs for indigenous persons when Governments use security concerns to restrict spiritual practices., The representative of Indonesia rejected “inaccurate references” against her State in the report. In this regard, she cited the 2017 decision of Indonesia’s Constitutional Court enabling native beliefs to be included in the national identity register, fostering their recognition by the State. Questioning the credibility of the previous Rapporteur, she asked Ms. Ghanea to uphold the principles of impartiality, objectivity and accuracy., The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, said that calls on States to uphold freedom of religion or belief constitute an obligation to protect all individuals, including persons holding nontheistic or atheistic beliefs, belonging to minorities and Indigenous Peoples. Expressing concern about restrictions imposed against indigenous peoples in the area of freedom of religion or belief, he asked how to better protect this right going forward., The representative of Pakistan, pointing to activities at the national and international level to promote the freedom of religion or belief and protect minorities, expressed concern over increasing islamophobia worldwide. She asked Ms. Ghanea what steps can be taken under her mandate to address the Islamophobia affecting Muslims globally., The representative of India, noting that his country represents a sixth of humanity and is a multireligious, multiethnic State, said that freedom of religion or belief is safeguarded by its independent judiciary. He rejected allegations in the report against India, stressing its inclusive nature, and called for impartial and objective reporting, based on credible sources., The representative of China pointed to rampant anti‑Muslim legislation in the United States, which is spreading Islamic threat theories across the world, including through the media. Noting that the war on terrorism has caused civilian casualties and deaths, she rejected allegations against her country regarding Xinjiang and Tibet as lies and double standards., The representative of Canada, noting that her country fully respects the rights to freedom of religion and belief, acknowledged that it has historically denied these rights. Pointing to Canada’s collaboration with indigenous peoples to promote their rights, she expressed concern over the global rise in religious hatred. Sharing the United States’ comments on China and Iran, she asked Ms. Ghanea how to better promote the values of inclusion to create an atmosphere of respect for religious beliefs., The representative of Iran expressed concern over the systematic discrimination against indigenous peoples in Canada as well as racism in law enforcement and the judiciary in the United States. Noting that the exercise of the freedom of expression carries special duties and responsibilities, she said that peaceful assembly can turn to violence in some cases and may be subject to restrictions if national security, public order or health are threatened. She invited Ms. Ghanea to continue following the situation of indigenous peoples in Canada and the United States., Ms. GHANEA, responding, said that freedom of religion and belief is only one violation Indigenous Peoples face, stressing that the report is rooted on the United Nations Expert Mechanism on the Rights of indigenous peoples and other bodies, spotlighting such abuses and concerns. Stressing the role of consultative groups, she said that free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous peoples must not be forgotten. Recognizing the role of multilateral institutions and other Special Rapporteurs, including those focusing on land, sacred sites and other human rights concerns, Ms. Ghanea said she is reaching out to these bodies. She urged States to respect a variety of religions and beliefs, including atheists or those who reject religion. Stressing that hate speech is a scourge in many societies, she said it will continue to be a matter of concern for her mandate. Noting the intersective nature of the right to freedom of religion or belief, she highlighted impacts of its violation on economic, social, cultural and political rights. “People are being prohibited from birth to death from being registered to being buried and everything in between in administrative processes, in daily life”, she said. She stressed the role non‑State actors, civil society and faith‑based organizations play in pushing Governments to address these issues. Adding that the mandate can support States to address their domestic challenges, including by carrying out country visits, she appealed to States to respond to her mandate’s communications, which will remain “violations‑centered” and emphasize communication., Also speaking in the dialogue were the representatives of the Netherlands, Cuba, Austria, Norway, Poland, Greece, Morocco and Hungary., Executions, MORRIS TIDBALL-BINZ, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, presenting his second report (document A/77/270) said his mandate resulted primarily from the clamour of victims, including mothers and families of victims of executions. Over the past year, he met with many representatives of States in Geneva and with academic and professional organizations, as well as non‑governmental organizations and families of victims to develop standards and good and best forensic practices. He issued a total of 194 State communications. The tragic reality of such executions, which are seen around the world, include atrocities and impunity, which affront human consciousness, he said, demanding investigations of all cases. States should ensure implementation of recommendations and standards developed by the mandate on avoiding the excessive use of force which could, in certain situations, lead to death. The report presented today includes a discussion on the death penalty as well as other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment, he said. The mandate has clearly contributed to strengthening the protection of the right to life during the 40 years of its existence. The report confirms the irreplaceable contribution and need for the mandate, which identifies and alerts States to a gap which needs to be filled to ensure the effective implementation of norms and standards developed. The death penalty is a grave violation of the right to life, he said, adding that its imposition involves suffering equivalent to torture. It also tragically impacts the family and loved ones of the person sentenced., In the ensuing interactive dialogue, the representative of Mexico opposed application of the death penalty for all crimes. Stressing the need to enhance the work of independent investigations through the adoption of appropriate legal regimes, he asked the Special Rapporteur about good practices for extraditions in cases when the crime for which extradition is requested is punishable by death. On extraditions from an abolition State to a State with the death penalty, he asked about protection granted to the extradited person., The representative of the United States, raising concern over killings perpetrated by the Taliban against civil society and women rights activities since its takeover last year, asked about ways to prevent arbitrary and extrajudicial killings perpetrated by State actors., Echoing his concerns, the representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, highlighted the growing need for forensic capacity building globally. She asked the Special Rapporteur what States should do to ensure professionalism in investigations of any potentially unlawful deaths., The representative of Pakistan emphasized that States are responsible for preventing extrajudicial killings in all circumstances and protecting the right to life. However, this right has been flagrantly violated in conflict, especially in situations of foreign occupation, she cautioned, pointing to illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir. New Delhi’s occupation forces are engaged in a campaign of killing Kashmiri youth as a political instrument to silence the demand for freedom. Such extrajudicial killings include organized massacres, targeted killings, custodial deaths and enforced disappearances, she said, noting that since 1989, more than 100,000 civilians have been killed extrajudicially. Yet, not a single Indian soldier has been punished for such extrajudicial killings, she asserted., In response, the representative of India, noting that the death penalty in his country is only used in rare cases, condemned yet another attempt by Pakistan to abuse the United Nations platform and spread its malicious propaganda against his country. Pakistan has been engaged in systematic persecutions, targeted killings, and discrimination against its ethnic and religious minorities, he stressed., The representative of Armenia drew attention to the evidence of summary executions of a group of his country’s servicemen who were captive and unarmed at the time of their execution. Stressing the importance of reliable investigative mechanisms to help ensure the investigation and prevention of unlawful killings, he asked the Special Rapporteur about ways to ensure that perpetrators of such heinous crimes are brought to justice., The representative of Myanmar condemned the summary and arbitrary executions perpetrated by the illegal military, voicing concern over the total lack of trial standards and due process, arbitrary killings, and torture of detainees., Responding to questions and comments, Mr. TIDBALL-BINZ called for coordinated efforts of States, non‑governmental organisations, academics and regional human rights organizations as well as the United Nations. To this end, he drew attention to the United Nations Manual on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra‑Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, known as the Minnesota Protocol, and stressed the importance of its implementation. He recommended that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) create a focal point within the Office for forensic capability, following the example of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Such capacity within the institution can play an important role in supporting the special procedure and other human rights mechanisms. During his mandate, he has provided training to medical and forensic specialists and judges on the use of tools such as the Minnesota Protocol, he stressed. The most frequent form of torture is the threat of death against the victim and their family. “What is the death penalty if not that?” he asked, calling for abolition of this barbaric practice., Also speaking were representatives of Côte d’Ivoire, United Kingdom, Sweden, China, Iran and Egypt., Terrorism, FIONNUALA NÍ AOLÁIN, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, presented her report on the relationship of peace work to promoting rights‑based societies. She recalled that United Nations’ peace work must hold the people themselves as the primary beneficiaries and not only Member States. She expressed concern that States increasingly engage in these processes through a terroristic, rather than a peace lens, which displaces international legal frameworks and undermines grassroots and civil society participation that is necessary for mediation and peace processes., She detailed her activities over the past year, highlighting visits to the Maldives, Uzbekistan and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) as well engagement with issues such as repatriation of third‑party nationals in northeast Syria and citizenship stripping. She noted positive repatriation practices in various countries, including Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, the Russian Federation, France and the United States, encouraging others to follow their examples., As conflicts become more complex, counter‑terrorism and peacebuilding require compromise, sometimes working with actors who have formerly engaged in violence, and support for legal frameworks to regulate armed conflict, she said. Underscoring the need for financial investment for appropriate United Nations entities, she stressed that twenty years of investment in counter‑terrorism, especially human rights light and civil society absent counter‑terrorism, which lack independent oversight, and sustained monitoring and evaluation, has simply not delivered for States. She called on States to consider whether budget proposals in the Fifth Committee are delivering on the ground., She said her report highlights the misuse of the language of extremism language and terrorism by States that undermines trust and may harm human rights defenders. It also addresses proscription, she said, adding that “when we place people in situations where we cannot speak to them we cannot do our work”. Further, she urged all Member States to implement the Fourth Geneva Convention to ensure that demonization through the misuse of counter‑terrorism law occurring in complex occupation situations does not thwart efforts to end them., In the ensuing interactive dialogue, the representative of Mexico expressed concern that the human rights pillar of the United Nations only receives 3 per cent of the total annual budget., The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as an observer, asked Ms. Ní Aoláin to cite civil society initiatives with a positive impact on counter‑terrorism practices., The representative of Cuba asked what could be done by the international community to bring the United States to justice for its so‑called War on Terror, which resulted in extrajudicial killings, torture and Guantanamo Bay prison, where 39 people are still arbitrarily detained., The representative of China echoed Cuba’s statement, adding that the United States and its allies have committed war crimes in and around the Middle East, threatening the right to religion and dignity, and calling on the Special Rapporteur to prevent recurrence., The representative of Costa Rica stressed that the root causes of terrorism include poverty, hate speech, and foreign occupation, and called on Member States to respect international law., The representative of Pakistan said that an unclear definition of terrorism itself in counter‑terrorism regimes has failed to distinguish between terrorism and self-determination, freedom of assembly and minority rights. She expressed concern that, since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, terrorism is unjustly associated with Islam., The representative of the United States said that the Government is in the process of making a transparent effort to transfer prisoners and close the Guantanamo Bay prison., The representative of Côte d’Ivoire said that disinformation gains ground in a context prone to terrorism, calling for vigilance with information and communications technology. Detailing laws and campaigns put in place to educate its population, he asked the Special Rapporteur how an international convention might address this situation., Responding to delegates, she said that civil society is indeed under attack through the misuse of counter‑terrorism law, stressing the importance of her work in documenting these instances. Further, the misuse of legislation is directly related to the lack of a set definition of terrorism, she said, adding that until precise definitions linked to acts of terrorism are adopted, misuse will continue. Affirming that the United Nations has many due‑diligence practices throughout its bodies, it is specifically lacking in counter‑terrorism operations and the cost is paid on the ground. Also, existing legislative frameworks fail to respond to right wing extremism, the greatest current threat, according to the Global Terrorism Index. Terrorism can only be addressed through a “whole‑of‑society” approach, she stressed. Underscoring that if counter‑terrorism does not apply human rights, international humanitarian, and refugee law, it may undermine the United Nations Charter itself., Also speaking were representatives of Switzerland, the Russian Federation, Qatar, the United Kingdom, Morocco, Ireland and India. An observer of the Sovereign Order of Malta also spoke., International Order, LIVINGSTONE SEWANYANA, Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, presented his report on the main challenges to the maintenance of international peace and security at the global level. He described the current tragic events in Ukraine and beyond as a powerful reminder that international peace and security cannot be secured without achieving nuclear disarmament and reducing military expenditure in favour of sustainable development. Nuclear weapons are the most inhumane weapons ever designed, he said, noting that their presence in the military arsenal of some States is typically justified by the policy of so‑called nuclear deterrence to keep peace. However, due to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences that possibly entail, they fundamentally constitute an inherent threat to the very existence of humanity, he cautioned., Addressing challenges to international peace and security, he stressed the importance of long‑overdue reform of some key United Nations bodies. Firstly, the Security Council should become more representative and transparent, as its current composition fails to represent today’s geopolitical realities. Secondly, permanent Members of the Security Council should refrain from using their veto power to block the functioning of this body. In fact, the use of this key prerogative should always be in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations. Thirdly, formal consultations with external stakeholders, in particular civil society organizations, should be put in place. Similarly, the General Assembly should exercise a greater role in decision‑making, he underscored., The representative of Azerbaijan rejected attempts to break down constitutional and democratic orders legitimately established by the people. She stressed the inalienable right of all peoples, particularly non‑self‑governing territories, as well as those under foreign occupation and colonial or alien domination to self‑determination. The exercise of this right remains valid and essential to ensure universal respect for human rights, she said, adding that the observance of international law and the fulfillment in good faith of States’ obligations is key for international peace and security., The representative of Venezuela denounced the increased use of unilateral measures to undermine the international order and multilateralism, imposing a system based on economic power. Stressing that such measures affect political dialogue and international cooperation, as well as economic growth and sustainable development, he underscored the impact they have on affected populations, including in accessing essential goods. Emphasizing the need to consolidate a proposal that addresses today’s challenges, he pointed to proposals made in the Third Committee, such as declarations on the right to development, international solidarity and responses to pandemics, stressing the need for an official systematization of unilateral coercive measures. He asked Mr. Sewanyana’s view on such proposals and how his mandate can contribute to making progress., The representative of Cuba, underscoring the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economies, said that a new order can never arise if unilateral coercive measures are still in place violating human rights. Stressing that such practices are contrary to the United Nations Charter and international law, as they hamper development, he noted that they increased during the pandemic. He called on Mr. Sewanyana to continue to study the impact of these measures on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order., The representative of Algeria said his country advocates for justice and cooperation in international relations as well as a new economic order that will enable all countries to leave no one behind. On the need to reform the Security Council and revitalize the General Assembly, he asked Mr. Sewanyana to share his thoughts and indicate what further actions the United Nations can take to promote a democratic and equitable international order., The representative of China said that, for political purposes, the United States and other countries have issued false information about other States, interfered in their affairs using human rights as a leverage, and advanced unilateral coercive measures. She called on the international community to reject hegemony, block politicization, and resist such measures., Responding, Mr. SEWANYANA stressed the role of multilateralism in overcoming global challenges, pointing to the 2024 Summit of the Future as an opportunity for the international community to address issues like the right to self‑determination and the necessity for all to ban the use of nuclear weapons. Inviting the United Nations General Assembly to reassert its role, he said that no single State, no matter how powerful, should override the decision of such a body. He invited the General Assembly to discuss the veto power in the Security Council as well as reform of the Council to make it more democratic, representative and responsive to the needs and aspirations of all., Foreign Debt, ATTIYA WARIS, Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, said that countries lose an estimated $483 billion in revenues per year, due to cross‑border corporate and offshore tax abuse by wealthy individuals. Such actions reduce the available pool of resources essential for investing in social policies and public services and realizing human rights. This is particularly concerning in a context where States face the economic and social impacts of multiple crises, which add pressure on nations, as it deprives them of significant resources to address the situation. It is also indicative of fundamental deficiencies at the international, regional and national tax governance architecture. States should promote a human rights‑based economy, one that enhances the well‑being and dignity of people, particularly those most marginalised, and that ensures human rights obligations are at the centre of financial and fiscal decision making. Critical principles of transparency, accountability, participation, social justice and fairness and justice should guide the development of such a system., States should align their fiscal policies and fulfil their financial obligations in line with human rights principles, she said. Tackling illicit financial flows has also been incorporated into the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including by reducing illicit financial flows and strengthening the recovery and return of stolen assets. The creation of a multilateral, inclusive and democratic fiscal architecture is crucial for States to fight the challenges of global tax avoidance and evasion. It is also necessary that States engage in international cooperation and assistance in the development and enforcement of fiscal law and policy, using democratic systems. In her report, Ms. Warie said, she has called States to take a range of measures, including: reform of the global taxation system in order to combat illicit financial flows, including extraterritorial obligations; a fourth International Conference on Financing for Development, that could discuss a United Nations tax convention and global tax body as well as current issues such as the benefits of a global asset registry; ensure that the promotion and realization of human rights is at the core of this reform; combat illicit financial flows, while strengthening international cooperation and assistance; and to launch negotiations of a United Nations led global tax convention., In the ensuing dialogue, the representative of Cuba said the impact of external debt on human rights, particularly social and cultural rights and the right to development, are undeniable, adding that Covid‑19 has shown the challenges facing developing countries in achieving these goals. Some countries chose to impose coercive unilateral measures, which have negative effects on the enjoyment of human rights, she said, stressing that the Independent Expert should investigate this further., The representative of the Russian Federation called on the Independent Expert to investigate Western countries that force other States to declare technical default due to their inability to service foreign debt, as such nations freeze their gold and other reserves., The representative of China said developed countries and multilateral institutions should do more to ensure debt relief for developing countries and expedite the return of illicit funds to countries of origin., The representative of Cameroon asked what impact a convention negotiated under United Nations auspices would have on the international financial architecture and financing for development as a whole., The representative of Algeria said it is time to review the international debt system, pointing out that countries are struggling to recover stolen assets. He asked how the inception of such bodies as mentioned by the Independent Expert could help., Responding, Ms. WARIS, Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, noted that earlier this year many Special Rapporteurs and Experts wrote a letter to the United States on the freezing of bank reserves, in the context of Afghanistan. Many developing countries do not have enough reserves, which impedes them from participating in regional membership groups, as they do not have the funds. There was a small gain post‑Covid‑19, but some countries are still going through the crisis, and thus the trade offs on how to spend money are resulting in a decision‑making quandary for many countries. There are private entities and corporations that control how financial information is shared, which layers the debt crisis over all others, she said. There are many issues concerning the division of private and public finance, she said, adding that more needs to be moved to public spaces, where they can be debated in a more transparent manner. The creation of a body where these discussions can take place will improve democracy in the world. There is currently a United Nations Committee on Tax Cooperation, she noted, but it needs to have value added to it, or be replaced by a larger entity where tax discussions can take place., The rescheduling of debt is not a solution, Ms. Waris said, as it multiplies the amount of debt incredibly. The vulnerability and shocks to the economy that developing countries are suffering is going to be a problem if the international community does not get a handle on interest rates. The biggest challenge facing the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals is the lack of accessible financial resources to achieve human rights. The international community needs to come together and unlock resources that exist, making them available to the most vulnerable., Also speaking in the dialogue was the representative of Mali., Transnational Corporations and Other Businesses, The Chair of the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, Fernanda Hopenhaym, presented the report (A/77/201) entitled “Corporate Influence in the Political and Regulatory Sphere: Ensuring Business Practice in line with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights”. She said it aims to distinguish between modes of corporate engagement that are rights‑respecting and those that may lead to human‑rights abuses. Private sector participation in policymaking must be conducted transparently and responsibly in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles, she said., Stressing that the Principles call on businesses to identify negative impacts and mitigate risks, she said that States and multilateral institutions have not done enough to require businesses to align their political engagement with human rights. Specifically, corporate influence in the political and regulatory spheres have produced negative impacts in contexts of climate, food, water and housing crises. The report states that corporate political engagement includes several categories of activities undertaken by businesses to influence political processes, such as influencing policymakers, academia, public narratives around political issues and the judiciary, she said. While all these activities may have legitimate applications, they can also lead to business‑related human rights abuses when carried out irresponsibly. They occur when businesses ignore human rights risks associated with political engagement and practice with weak oversight or a lack of transparency and due diligence., She offered recommendations to States to ensure coherence between businesses’ political activities and their respective human rights duties, including mandatory human rights due diligence legislation applying to businesses, mandatory lobbying registers and disclosure as well as conflict of interest laws and other asset disclosure systems for government officials and regulators., In the ensuing interactive dialogue, the representative of Morocco said that businesses are important stakeholders and therefore their engagement is useful. She asked what best practices are in training business actors who are not skilled in politics or law., The representative of Luxembourg detailed the country’s Registry of Transparency, which requires parliamentary members to register contacts with all non‑legislative actors., The representative of Malaysia, noting that the report mentions that his country is misleading the public on palm oil, said that the industry employs more than three million Malaysians, and the Government implemented a sustainable palm oil scheme in 2015. Further, the State has demanded that labour laws be respected and established an online platform for workers to lodge complaints. Despite this work, the industry, the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) and workers are suffering, he said, calling for public education about positive steps for change that the Government has implemented., The representative of Portugal said that negotiation is currently underway in Geneva on a business and human rights instrument, adding that global conflict has increased opportunities for businesses to commit human rights violations. Detailing the country’s steps to create its own regulatory framework, he asked the Special Rapporteur what advice she would give to countries that are planning to draw up similar legislation for the first time., The representative of the United States expressed concern about the ways that corporate influence can put human rights defenders at risk, particularly through lawsuits., The representative of China expressed concern about references in the report to the United States’ trade and human rights abuses through lobbying. Highlighting massive layoffs in the country that affected minorities disproportionately, she also decried forced labour and trafficking in the agriculture sector. She added that if the United States truly cared about human rights, it would act on its own violations instead of causing unemployment in Xinjiang., The representative of Syria said that he felt unattached to the subject as economic blockades prevent businesses or multinationals from operating in his country., In her response, Ms. HOPENHAYM advocated a smart mix of measures tailored to States’ needs to protect human rights in a business context, including national action plans and regulatory public policies. Voicing support for the discussions and ensuing legal instrument, she said that an independent expert is also contributing to discussions there. She encouraged States to have their own discussions internally on how to regulate businesses and lobbies with multiple stakeholders including businesses and civil society actors to acknowledge power imbalances. The discussions themselves must be regulated, she said, or undue influence may only increase human rights violations. Adding that human rights defenders must also be protected, she recalled the Guideline her Group published in 2021 as well as a report on corruption. She highlighted future visits to Luxembourg, Liberia, and Argentina, as well as this year’s Forum on Business and Human rights entitled “Rightsholders at the Center”., Also speaking were representatives of Switzerland, France, Ireland, and Russian Federation, the representative of the European Union spoke in its capacity as an observer., Special Envoy on Myanmar, NOELEEN HEYZER, Special Envoy of the Secretary‑General on Myanmar, warned that the political, human rights and humanitarian crisis in Myanmar continues to take a catastrophic toll on the people, with 13.2 million facing food insecurity, 1.3 million internally displaced, and 40 per cent of the population living below the poverty line. Military operations continue using a disproportionate use of force, including aerial bombings, burning of civilian structures, and the killing of civilians, including children. In this context, she condemned the recent indiscriminate air strikes in Kachin State that killed many civilians. The plight of the Rohingya people, along with other forcibly displaced communities, remains desperate, with many seeking refuge through dangerous land and sea journeys. The violence between the Arakan Army and the military in Rakhine has escalated to levels not seen since late 2020, with significant cross‑border incursions, harming conditions for durable return, and prolonging the burden on Bangladesh as a host country of about 1 million Rohingya refugees., Calling for an inclusive Myanmar‑led process to the democratic transition, she urged the military to end aerial bombing and burning of civilian infrastructure; ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance without discrimination; release all children and political prisoners; put in place a moratorium on executions; and ensure well‑being of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi. She also highlighted Myanmar’s responsibility to create conditions for the voluntary and safe return of Rohingya refugees. The recent forced return of Myanmar nationals underlines the urgency of a coordinated Association of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN) response to address shared regional challenges caused by the conflict, she underscored, describing education as a powerful tool to prepare Rohingya refugees for their return to Myanmar. “There is a new political reality in Myanmar: people demanding change, no longer willing to accept military rule,” she asserted., The representative of Myanmar said the air strike carried out by the military on 23 October in Hpakant, Kachin State, resulted in the death of 100 people, including women and children. He stressed that the military junta is attempting to gain legitimacy through their sham 2023 election, while holding elected political leaders as hostages and crushing any civic space, including independent media and civil society. Such elections would never lead to a democratic transition, only instability and permanent military control empowered by total impunity, he added. Warning against the vicious cycle of atrocities committed by the military, he said the military offers no guarantee for the safe and dignified return of the Rohingya refugees. The sustainable solution to the situation in Myanmar is a transformative change towards a democratic future, he noted, emphasizing that people in Myanmar need protection from further military atrocities as well as humanitarian assistance. To end military impunity, the Security Council must use admissible evidence to refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court, he asserted, calling also for a broader mandate for the Special Envoy on Myanmar., The representative of Bangladesh, a country directly affected by the crisis in Myanmar, called for a lasting solution to the crisis. He voiced regret that the Special Envoy was unable to visit Rakhine State, the home of the displaced Rohingya refugees. Stressing the importance of accountability, he called on Member States to cooperate with the accountability mechanisms, including the International Court of Justice and International Criminal Court., The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, decried the death sentences carried out by the military junta in July 2022 against four civil society activists, after decades with no recorded executions in Myanmar. Recent executions negate all prospects for the return of the country to a democratic path, she cautioned., Echoing her concerns, the representative of Thailand called for meaningful steps towards de‑escalation of violence and the finding of peaceful political solutions that would benefit Myanmar and its people. The international community should support the role of ASEAN and prevent escalation of hostilities, he underlined., The representative of Mexico voiced concern over violations of human rights perpetrated by the Myanmar military, including its use of the death penalty, violence against women and girls, and escalation of tensions in the Rakhine State. Calling for the safe and dignified return of Rohingya refugees, he asked the Special Envoy how States can support her mandate through the work of the Third Committee., Meanwhile, the representative of the Russian Federation, supporting the efforts of ASEAN to resolve the situation within and outside Myanmar, opposed threats and sanctions imposed on Myanmar, as they push extremist forces to continuing military activities, the victims of which are civilians., Responding to questions and comments, Ms. Noeleen Heyzer said it is not sustainable for Bangladesh to host such large numbers of refugees and called for conducive conditions for the voluntary return of the Rohingya refugees to their places of origin. To this end, she underscored the importance of protection and security guarantees. Turning to the multidimensional crisis that occurred after the coup, she drew attention to root causes of displacement that have affected the Rohingya and many other communities, especially in active conflict. Reiterating her commitment to engaging with all stakeholders, including the ASEAN Envoy, she called for a Myanmar-led solution built on the will of its people and supported by regional unity. In this context, she underscored the key role of ASEAN as well as neighbouring countries that share a border with Myanmar. Urging for strengthened dialogue and mediation efforts to reduce the level of violence, which is the cause of the humanitarian crisis, she warned that humanitarian assistance does not reach the people who are most in need., Also speaking were representatives of Lichtenstein, France, Türkiye, Germany, Norway, Japan and China., For information media.

"Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar - Bulletin Issue 7, October 2022 [EN/MY]",Situation Report,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,25 Oct 2022,"MESSAGE FROM THE HEAD OF THE MECHANISM, There is mounting evidence that crimes against humanity and war crimes in Myanmar are intensifying. The people of Myanmar continue to suffer because of the lack of accountability for those who believe they answer to no law. In this context of impunity, the work of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar has never been more important. Every person in my team is committed to the Mechanism’s vision of collecting the evidence needed to ensure that perpetrators of the most serious international crimes in Myanmar face justice., The preliminary findings outlined in our fourth Annual Report released in August indicate that there are widespread and systematic attacks against the civilian population of Myanmar. We are regularly receiving reports of indiscriminate attacks and heinous crimes perpetuated by members of the security forces and armed groups against civilians, including children. These crimes include torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence against both men and women., While the Mechanism is very actively collecting evidence of crimes committed in the post-coup period, we continue to focus on crimes against the Rohingya, particularly related to the 2017 clearance operations. August marked five years since the wave of violence that resulted in around three-quarters of a million Rohingya fleeing their homes to neighboring Bangladesh. On my recent visit to Cox’s Bazar where most of those displaced now live, Rohingya I met consistently asked how the Mechanism could help them return to their homes in Myanmar. As I explained to them, the Mechanism hopes that by helping to bring those responsible for the crimes that led to their forced displacement to justice, we will contribute to creating conditions that will allow their safe and voluntary return to their homes. We are committed to collecting evidence of the individuals responsible and supporting legal proceedings, including ensuring close cooperation and timely sharing of evidence with the ongoing investigations by the International Criminal Court and The Gambia v. Myanmar proceedings before the International Court of Justice., I am grateful to the many brave individuals who have provided us with vital first-hand information about the crimes that have been committed in Myanmar, and to the Member States who have supported us to conduct in-person screenings and interviews on their territories. Conducting voluntary face-to-face interviews with witnesses is essential for our efforts to build files that will effectively facilitate criminal prosecutions. The Mechanism prioritizes the safety and security of witnesses and endeavors to refer witnesses to partners who can provide psychological and/or medical assistance to those who seek it. We call on all Member States who support accountability efforts to each do their part to ensure that witnesses are safe and have access to psychological and medical support., For decades perpetrators of serious international crimes in Myanmar have believed that they could act with impunity. At the Mechanism, we are committed to breaking this cycle and we are focusing all our efforts to ensure that those responsible for serious international crimes in the country will one day face justice., -Nicholas Koumjian",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/independent-investigative-mechanism-myanmar-bulletin-issue-7-october-2022-enmy
Myanmar Junta Airstrike Apparent Laws-of-War Violation,News and Press Release,HRW,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",25 Oct 2022,"(Bangkok) – On the evening of October 23, 2022, the Myanmar military carried out an airstrike on a music concert in Hpakant, Kachin State, organized by the opposition Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) to commemorate the ethnic organization’s 62nd anniversary. Local media reported that at least 60 people were killed and 100 injured, and that the Myanmar military blocked access to medical care for those harmed. The concert was held at a base also used for military training by the KIO’s armed wing, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA)., The following quote can be attributed to Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch:, The Myanmar military’s airstrike on hundreds of concertgoers in Kachin State is an apparent violation of the laws of war, which prohibit attacks causing indiscriminate or disproportionate civilian harm. Myanmar military operations in ethnic minority areas have long been characterized by a near total disregard for civilian lives and property and a failure to abide by international law. The military’s entrenched impunity underlines the need for an international investigation of those responsible for this attack and the many others committed by security forces since the February 2021 military coup., For over a year and a half, the junta has carried out grave abuses against the millions of people who oppose military rule, amounting to crimes against humanity and war crimes. How high does the death count need to reach before governments around the world impose consequences that will impact the junta’s behavior?, This horrific attack should trigger renewed efforts by concerned states to enforce tougher sanctions on the junta, including cutting off its access to foreign currency revenues as well as arms and aviation fuel. The United Nations Security Council should urgently pass a resolution imposing a global arms embargo on the junta and referring the situation to the International Criminal Court. Southeast Asian leaders meeting this week and at the ASEAN Summit in November should signal their support for such efforts to bring justice to the victims of the junta’s abuses across the country.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-junta-airstrike-apparent-laws-war-violation

Myanmar: Deadly air strikes in Kachin State appear to fit pattern of unlawful attacks,News and Press Release,Amnesty,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",24 Oct 2022,"Responding to the news that Myanmar military air strikes reportedly killed dozens of people including civilians at a concert in Kachin State on Sunday night, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director Hana Young said:, “Singers, artists and other civilians are among those reported killed in last night’s air strikes. We fear this attack is part of a pattern of unlawful aerial attacks by the military which have killed and injured civilians in areas controlled by armed groups., “The military has shown ruthless disregard for civilian lives in its escalating campaign against opponents. It is difficult to believe the military did not know of a significant civilian presence at the site of this attack. The military must immediately grant access to medics and humanitarian assistance to those affected by these air strikes and other civilians in need., “Myanmar’s military has been committing widespread atrocities since the 2021 coup, including unlawfully killing, arbitrarily detaining, torturing and forcibly displacing civilians. It has been able to carry out these crimes in the face of an ineffective international response to a human rights crisis that is only worsening., “As officials and leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations prepare to host high-level meetings in the coming weeks, this attack highlights the need to overhaul the approach to the crisis in Myanmar. ASEAN has to step up and formulate a more robust course of action so that military leaders end this escalating repression.”, Background:, On 23 October, the Myanmar military launched air strikes on a musical performance near A Nan Pa village in Hpakant Township, Kachin State, in the north of the country., The attack reportedly killed dozens of people, but Amnesty could not independently confirm the figures. Among those injured and killed were civilians including prominent artists who were performing at the event. The performance was held as part of celebrations for the 62nd anniversary of the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO)., The KIO is the political wing of the Kachin Independence Army, which controls the area and has clashed with the Myanmar military for decades., The military has increasingly relied on air power as it struggles to retain control of the country since seizing power in a coup on 1 February 2021., In a July report, “Bullets rained from the sky”: War crimes and displacement in eastern Myanmar, Amnesty International found that Myanmar’s military has subjected Karen and Karenni civilians to collective punishment via widespread aerial and ground attacks, arbitrary detentions, often including torture or extrajudicial executions, and the systematic looting and burning of villages.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-deadly-air-strikes-kachin-state-appear-fit-pattern-unlawful-attacks

Water Sanitation Hygiene",21 Oct 2022,"The migrant-centred “Aye Chan Thaw Ein” (ACTE) project aims to strengthen and empower migrants and their families through multi-sectoral interventions. The project covers such topics as awareness of safe migration and labour rights, enhancing vocational skills and providing opportunities for upward mobility, promoting healthier nutritional behaviour and improving access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities and practices in Shwe Pyi Thar township, Yangon Region., Under the project, People in Need (PIN) and our consortium partner, Community Development Association (CDA), have provided lifesaving WASH assistance to migrant workers, their families, and the host community. The project allows migrants to adopt safe hygiene practices and access improved WASH facilities in six wards in the Shwe Pyi Thar township., The peri-urban area of Yangon, Shwe Pyi Thar township, has been negatively impacted by unhealthy and environmentally unfriendly behaviours, such as dumping waste into drains, rivers, streams, or creeks due to low potential rates of disposal at community dumping sites. This severely impacts and harms the surrounding environment and causes risks for the population during the rainy season., As part of WASH assistance, we---together with CDA---have improved WASH-related hardware, such as drainage, conducted emergency clearing, and offered innovative solutions for waste management through a participatory community approach. Moreover, CDA awarded community grants to address specific WASH-related issues and promote engagement with the household- and community levels on gender-responsive WASH solutions, including sanitation, hygiene and menstrual hygiene management (MHM) and waste management., Improved access to waste management and drainage system, As part of WASH-related hardware solutions, CDA has constructed 11 concrete community drainage culvert systems in six wards. U Maung Maung (name has been changed for security reasons) member of the targeted wards says, ""we thank CDA and donors for upgrading drainage systems and providing emergency cleaning process in our ward. There were floods in our ward in previous rainy seasons due to the lack of good waste disposal management. Most household members are migrant workers in our ward, with minimal waste disposal knowledge. Although we put warning signs at each drain not to throw anything into these drainages, people did not follow the instructions."" He adds, ""with a small grant program from the CDA and community participation, we renovated our main drain. Because of the support from the ACTE project, the drainage systems are free to flow smoothly, and flooding is also prevented."", U Kyi (name has been changed for security reasons) also expresses his gratitude to CDA, “I lived near the main community drainage. In the past, during heavy rains, waste was stuck in the drainage and caused flooding where water entered our houses. While drain water was trapped, it created bad smells and contained many mosquitoes. Now, these problems have been solved with the support of CDA. Thanks to CDA and its donors for cleaning the drainage system and maintaining the upgrade of it.”, CDA aims to assist and improve the lives of migrant workers and their families by sharing knowledge about improved WASH facilities and good hygiene practices through awareness-raising activities. In total, CDA reached 8,148 individuals, of which 6,242 were women and girls., As part of the lifesaving WASH assistance, such as drainage systems and waste management, it aimed to benefit a more significant number of community members and migrant workers who reside in the wards for sustainability beyond the project life. CDA also conducted capacity-building activities, especially on sanitation, hygiene and menstrual hygiene management practices at the grassroots level where women, adolescent girls, the elderly and persons with disability can have easier access to learning opportunities., Regarding the behaviour changes of waste disposal and good hygiene and sanitation practices, CDA conducted behavioural change campaigns at five wards in Shwe Pyi Thar township. Ko Win Htut Thein, a project manager at CDA addresses how to implement good hygiene practices among the host community and internal migrants. ""CDA aims to assist and improve the lives of migrant workers and their families by sharing knowledge about improved WASH facilities and good hygiene practices through awareness-raising activities. In total, CDA reached 8,148 individuals, of which 6,242 were women and girls.”, He added that “the awareness sessions focused on intensified hygiene promotion on handwashing and menstrual hygiene management by holding small groups at each ward. Along with this session, CDA distributed hygiene supplies to all participants.” Also, CDA organised three public events on behaviour change, including handwashing, menstrual hygiene, and waste disposal public campaigns from December 2021 to March 2022. CDA also provided hygiene items to the host community and the migrants’ families actively involved in the campaigns. Through menstrual hygiene management awareness and education sessions, CDA reached a total of 2,981 beneficiaries, including 2,709 women and girls and 272 boys and men., Safe water for host communities and migrant workers, To access safe water and prevent water-borne diseases in Shwe Pyi Thar, CDA has constructed a 200-foot-long community drainage system in ward 21. First, CDA organised a community-level committee on WASH solutions based on their needs and provided a grant to implement with the collaboration of community members., One of the committee members U Kyaw Moe (name has been changed for security reasons) shares their needs. “Our ward is quite close to Hlaing River, and flood water always enters the ward when it rains. We rely on water sources from community ponds but need to access clean water. Water resources are enough for us in the rainy season, but we face water scarcity in the dry season. With the ACTE project’s long-term support, CDA provided one water truck and constructed the drainage system near the school compound. With this water truck, we will be safe for clean water access and no need to worry about flood water next season. Thanks to CDA and PIN for supporting us.”, People in Need and its consortium partners have been working together under the Aye Chan Thaw Ein project in collaboration with ward development committees to meet the needs of internal migrant workers and reduce the vulnerability of internal migrants with the financial support of the Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund (LIFT) in Myanmar.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/helping-migrant-workers-their-families-and-host-communities-good-hygiene-practices

ACLED Regional Overview: East Asia Pacific (8-14 October 2022),Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,20 Oct 2022,"Last week in the East Asia Pacific region, civilians were killed during a clash between the Myanmar military and a local resistance group near a Buddhist religious site in Myanmar's Mon state. The United League of Arakan/Arakan Army (ULA/AA) attacked and occupied a border guard police outpost in Rakhine state, while the Restoration Council of Shan State/Shan State Army-South (RCSS/SSA-S) clashed with the Pa-Oh National Liberation Organization/Pa-Oh National Liberation Army (PNLO/PNLA) in southern Shan state. North Korea carried out another series of missile tests. In the Philippines, fighting between the communist New People's Army (NPA) and state forces intensified. Meanwhile, police shot three militant detainees dead after they took a detained former senator hostage during an attempted jailbreak., In Myanmar, a local resistance group attacked a military checkpoint at the foot of the Kyaiktiyo Golden Rock Pagoda, a famous Buddhist pilgrimage site, in Mon state on 12 October. Three women pilgrims were killed in the crossfire. Eighteen others, including a police officer, were injured. The resistance group and military accused each other of killing the civilians (Myanmar Now, 13 October 2022)., Elsewhere, in Rakhine state, the ULA/AA attacked and occupied the Lait-ya border guard police outpost in Maungdaw township on 10 October, inflicting police casualties and seizing weapons and ammunition (Irrawaddy, 11 October 2022). One ULA/AA member was killed in the fighting (Narinjara, 10 October 2022). Members of another border guard police outpost in nearby Kyein Chaung village fired artillery at the ULA/AA during the clash. The ULA/AA claimed the Lait-ya border guard police outpost had been responsible for artillery attacks on civilians (Narinjara, 11 October 2022). Fighting between the two groups has intensified over the past few months. These trends contribute to the 717% increase in average weekly violent events in Rakhine state in the past month relative to the weekly average for the preceding year flagged by ACLED's Subnational Threat Tracker. The Subnational Tracker also warned of increased violence in Rakhine state during the preceding four weeks., In southern Shan state, fighting broke out between the RCSS/SSA-S, an ethnic Shan armed group, and the PNLO/PNLA, an ethnic Pa-Oh armed group, on 11 October in the reportedly PNLO/PNLA-controlled Ka Du Gyi area of Mawkmai township. The PNLO/PNLA claimed that the clash resulted from the RCSS/SSA-S's failure to inform them of troop movements, as required by the 2015 Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (Shan Herald Agency for News, 13 October 2022). The clash came after the RCSS/SSA-S invited ethnic armed organizations operating in Shan state and other areas to meet to ease tensions and to discuss potential cooperation (Thanlwin Times, 11 October 2022). ACLED's Subnational Surge Tracker warned of increased violence in southern Shan state during the preceding four weeks. Violence in southern Shan state is both common and highly volatile; it is considered an area of 'extreme risk' by ACLED's Volatility and Risk Predictability Index., North Korea continued to carry out missile tests last week. On 9 October, North Korea test-fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off the country's east coast, before test-firing two long-range cruise missiles into the sea off its west coast on 12 October. On 14 October, North Korea flew 10 warplanes close to the border with South Korea, before launching a short-range ballistic missile into the sea off its east coast and firing hundreds of artillery shells into a maritime buffer zone surrounding the Northern Limit Line (AP, 14 October 2022). These activities came after North Korea's defense ministry criticized the recent redeployment of a US aircraft carrier near the Korean Peninsula (YNA, 6 October 2022)., Last week in the Philippines, fighting between NPA rebels and the military intensified, with clashes reported in Bicol and Soccsksargen, as well as Central, Western, and Eastern Visayas. These trends contribute to a 75% increase in violent events in the Philippines over the past week relative to the weekly average for the preceding month, as flagged by ACLED's Conflict Change Map. In Western Visayas, Himamaylan city saw fierce clashes on 8, 10, and 12 October, leaving a suspected high-ranking NPA leader, Romeo Nanta (also known as Juanito Magbanua), dead. The NPA claimed that Nanta was not killed in the clash, but rather, captured and summarily executed (Rappler, 11 October 2022). Human rights group Karapatan condemned alleged military abuses against civilians during the clashes, including allegedly indiscriminate artillery fire and aerial bombing (Karapatan, 12 October 2022). As a result of the clashes, the military implemented lockdowns in several affected barangays, and the city government declared a state of calamity (Manila Bulletin, 12 October 2022). Around 15,000 villagers were also evacuated from the area (Panay News, 12 October 2022)., Meanwhile, a high-profile jailbreak attempt led to the deaths of three detained Islamist militants in Quezon City last week. On 9 October, three militant detainees -- alleged members of Abu Sayyaf and Dawlah Islamiyah -- attempted to escape from the Philippine National Police Custodial Center, wounding a police officer with an improvised knife and taking detained former Senator Leila de Lima hostage during the attempt. Responding police officers shot the militant detainees dead and freed de Lima, who was lightly wounded. The incident led to renewed calls for the release of de Lima, a prominent critic of former President Rodrigo Duterte. De Lima has been held in police custody since February 2017 on drug-related charges, which human rights organizations and opposition groups view as politically motivated (HRW, 4 May 2022; Manila Bulletin, 9 October 2022)., Note: This dashboard automatically updates to cover the latest four weeks of data released by ACLED.

Protection and Human Rights",18 Oct 2022,"FOOD SECURITY SNAPSHOT, Below-average 2022 paddy production forecast, Above-average cereal exports forecast in 2022/23, Prices of rice at record high in August, Persistent conflict continues to cause displacements, Below-average 2022 paddy output forecast, The 2022 main rainfed paddy crop, which accounts for more than 80 percent of the annual production, is approaching the harvest stage. Although drier-than-average conditions in late May and early June delayed planting operations in the central producing areas, the area sown to the main rice crop is estimated close to the five-year average. Precipitation amounts improved from late June and have been generally near-average until September. The total 2022 paddy production, including the secondary crops to be planted at the end of the year, is forecast at 23.8 million tonnes, about 10 percent below the five-year average level. Yields have been affected by limited use of critical agricultural inputs due to their elevated prices. According to a recent survey conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), domestic prices of urea and compound fertilizers in July 2022 were 90 and 75 percent, respectively, higher year-on-year, while prices of herbicides and pesticides increased by 50 and 40 percent, respectively., Cereal exports in 2022/23 forecast at above-average level, Total cereal exports in the 2022/23 marketing year (July/June) are forecast at about 4.2 million tonnes, 15 percent above the average volume. Exports of maize are forecast at a record of 1.7 million tonnes, reflecting the expected production surplus and the steady demand from China (mainland) and Thailand. Rice exports in calendar year 2022 are forecast at 2.3 million tonnes., The 2022 main maize crop, for harvest from late October, is growing under generally favourable weather conditions (ASI map). Total maize production, including the secondary crops to be planted in November, is forecast at an above-average level of 2.2 million tonnes, reflecting record area planted driven by robust export demand and high domestic prices. However, average yields are projected at the lowest level since 2015 as a result of constrained access to agricultural inputs, as well as pests and diseases., Prices of rice at record high in August, Domestic prices of “Emata” rice, a widely consumed quality, have steadily increased since January 2022 and reached record highs in August. The price increase was associated with consecutive seasons of production declines, a recovery in exports, high transportation and input costs, and expectations of a below-average production of 2022 main paddy crops. Prices in August were almost 50 percent higher than a year before., Persistent conflict continues to cause displacements, According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as of September 2022, the number of additional displaced people following the military takeover in February 2021 is estimated at 982 000, bringing the total number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) to about 1.3 million. Most IDPs reside in Rakhine, Chin, Kachin, Kayin and Shan states. Macroeconomic difficulties, due to lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and political instability, have caused widespread loss of income and livelihoods, sharply reducing households’ purchasing power. Decreased production stemming from localized paddy crop losses, combined with the high prices of energy, fuel and essential food items, may cause a significant decline in output leading to a deterioration of food security outcomes in 2022/23.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/giews-country-brief-myanmar-18-october-2022
Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar - Fact Sheet [EN/MY],News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,22 Jul 2022,"What is the Myanmar Mechanism?, The Mechanism is a UN entity that was created to promote accountability and justice for the victims and survivors of the most serious international crimes and human rights violations committed in Myanmar since 2011. The Mechanism started its operations at the end of August 2019., The Mechanism was established by the UN Human Rights Council in September 2018 in response to reports that gross human rights violations amounting to serious international crimes, including in Kachin, Rakhine and Shan states., It is crucial that evidence of these crimes is collected and preserved to prevent their disappearance, concealment or destruction. This will eventually enable persons who caused so much suffering to be prosecuted and brought to justice., What does the Myanmar Mechanism do?, The Mechanism collects and preserves information, documentation and evidence regarding the most serious international crimes and violations of international law committed in Myanmar since 2011. Serious international crimes include war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide., The Mechanism analyses the materials that it collects to establish what crimes were committed and which persons are responsible for those crimes. The Mechanism also uses the materials to prepare case files., The Mechanism shares certain materials and case files with national, regional or international courts or tribunals which comply with international law standards, do not impose or carry out the death penalty, and respect the safety and privacy of witnesses and victims., The Mechanism explains and communicates its mandate and work to relevant stakeholders, including survivors, civil society and the public., What does the Myanmar Mechanism investigate?, The Mechanism investigates the most serious international crimes and violations of international law committed in Myanmar since 2011. It is not limited to investigating such crimes in certain areas of Myanmar, but can investigate such crimes committed in any part of the country. The Mechanism is impartial and independent, and will investigate crimes regardless of the ethnicity, nationality, race or religion of the victims or the perpetrators. The Mechanism can investigate situations in Myanmar since 2011, as well as ongoing and future situations., How is the Mechanism different from other UN entities working on Myanmar?, The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar monitors the human rights situation in the country and submits reports to the UN Human Rights Council. The Special Rapporteur also issues public statements and formal communications to the Government of Myanmar., There are also other UN agencies or entities that work on issues relating to Myanmar. For example, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) is mandated to promote and protect human rights, including by speaking out objectively in the face of human rights violations worldwide. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) provides assistance to refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced and stateless people. The UN Development Programme (UNDP) and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) help to strengthen law and justice institutions in Myanmar., How is the Myanmar Mechanism different from other accountability processes on Myanmar?, The Mechanism received materials from the UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (FFM) when the FFM concluded its work end August 2019. While the FFM’s work focused on human rights reporting, the Mechanism focuses on holding individual perpetrators responsible for the crimes that they have committed. This requires a higher standard of proof, and involves legal procedures that are longer and more complex., The Mechanism is not a court that can hold trials, or a prosecution office that can prosecute individual perpetrators. However, the Mechanism’s evidence and case files can be used by prosecutors and judicial authorities from competent courts. The Mechanism will work to promote justice and accountability by any and all suitable institution – whether that is an international tribunal, a regional court or a national court that has jurisdiction., At the International Court of Justice (ICJ), The Gambia initiated a case against Myanmar in 2019, alleging that the Myanmar security forces committed genocidal acts against the Rohingya in violation of the Genocide Convention. This ICJ case is a litigation between States regarding the responsibility of a State, rather than the prosecution of individual perpetrators. The Mechanism has been sharing materials relevant to this case with both The Gambia and Myanmar, in accordance with its mandate., Since 2019, there has also been an ongoing investigation at the International Criminal Court (ICC) related to the forced deportation of Rohingya from Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh. Part of the Mechanism’s mandate is to cooperate with the ICC., How can I provide information to the Myanmar Mechanism?, If you are interested in providing information, the Mechanism can be contacted securely via Signal message at: +41 76 691 12 08., Emails can also be directed to the Mechanism’s secure email account: contact@myanmar-mechanism.org It is advisable, to ensure maximum information security, that any messages be fully deleted from the devices from which they are sent., The Mechanism recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy and security of persons who provide information to the Mechanism. The Mechanism will not share the information you provide, or any information about your identity, without your consent., For more information, please visit iimm.un.org or facebook.com/MyanmarMechanism",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/independent-investigative-mechanism-myanmar-fact-sheet-enmy

Shelter and Non-Food Items
Water Sanitation Hygiene",14 Oct 2022,"To date, this Emergency Appeal, which seeks CHF 4,500,000, is 58 per cent funded. This funding has been crucial to enable the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS), with the support of the IFRC, to continue providing humanitarian assistance and protection to the people on the move, as well to strengthen their preparedness efforts., A. SITUATION ANALYSIS, Description of the crisis, Since the military intervention on 1 February 2021, the country has remained in a state of political crisis as the economy falters and the humanitarian situation worsens. The country is now entering the second year of the crisis, where the complexity and multi-dimensional characteristics have been fuelled by ongoing inter-factional tensions. The pre-existing impact of COVID-19 has escalated the suffering of the people and the recovery has yet to be seen., Fighting continues in states and regions across Myanmar to oppose the State Administration Council (SAC) in towns and villages. The security and humanitarian situation across Myanmar thus remain tense, with escalating violence and armed clashes. Nearly 2,000 civilians are reported as having been killed during the incidents since the military intervention. This has led to new displacements that, as of 2 September 2022, have resulted in more than 974,000 people displaced, including more than 250,000 children since 1 February 2021. This is an addition to the pre-existing displacement in the country, making up a total of over 1.3 million internally displaced people (IDPs) across the country. The number of IDPs is not stable as the IDPs remain on the move., The increase in commodity prices, including food and fuel, due to inflation and global food supply, has worsened and increased the vulnerability of the affected people. Main services in the country have significantly reduced, such as banking, primary health services, and education. The disruption of the banking system has had an impact on access to cash, in turn delaying the delivery of humanitarian assistance, in addition to movement and access restrictions. The monsoon season has started and continues to cause heavy rain and flooding. During the month of June 2022, about 600 people were relocated to higher grounds due to flooding in Kachin state. In August 2022, the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) supported aid-delivering services with the people affected by the flood in Yak Sauk Township in Southern Shan State. With the reduction of primary health care across the country, the spread of communicable and waterborne diseases may increase challenges in accessing reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (RMNCAH), including antenatal care and support to pregnant women. More than four million children – half of the school-aged children – are estimated as not having accessed education for two full academic years., There has been an increase in armed clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF), ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) and the local People’s Defence Forces (PDFs) in the country’s northwest, as well as other parts of the country. More than 18,000 civilians’ properties, including houses, churches, monasteries, and schools are reported as having been destroyed, burnt and searched, due to the clashes and violence, and people displaced in Sagaing and Magway regions and Chin state. The armed clashes have led to the increase of travel restrictions issued by the authority and to the limitation of humanitarian access, especially in the southeast and northwest., Since June 2022, armed violence between the SAC and the Arakan Army (AA) has escalated in northern parts of Rakhine State. In August 2022, frequent fighting including the use of heavy weapons has been reported in Rakhine State — especially in the townships of Rathedaung, Buthidaung, Maungdaw (northern Rakhine), Mrauk-U, Minbya, Kyauktaw, (central Rakhine) and Taungup (southern Rakhine), and in Paletwa Township of Southern Chin State. The escalation of armed violence across Rakhine State and Southern Chin State has already had a marked humanitarian impact in those areas, including an increase in displacement in northern Rakhine State. Access is still challenging as many areas including waterways and roads have been blocked in northern Rakhine State, while medical supplies and food have been restricted into Paletwa Township in southern Chin State.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-complex-emergency-operation-operation-update-no-3-mdrmm016

Promotion and protection of human rights: human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, Summary, In July, Myanmar’s military junta executed four political prisoners, including a prominent pro-democracy activist and a former member of parliament. These unconscionable acts are consistent with the junta’s unflinching embrace of violence against the people of Myanmar. In recent months, military forces have systematically bombed and burned villages and massacred innocent civilians, including eleven children in Sagaing Region who were shot and killed when junta forces attacked their school in September. These forces have killed thousands and displaced nearly one million people since the coup. Many of the more than 12,000 political prisoners have been tortured and an unknown number have died in custody., In the midst of this darkness, however, Myanmar civil society is a shining light and inspiration. Activists, human rights defenders, aid workers, community leaders, journalists, health care professionals, and educators are among those who are taking great personal risks to document atrocities, deliver humanitarian assistance, and respond to the needs of displaced and traumatized communities. Human rights organizations, women’s associations, professional networks, trade unions and labour activists, and grassroots groups are adopting strategies to remain safe and effective in a deadly environment. In many cases, individuals and organizations are operating with little international support and few opportunities to communicate with the outside world., In this report, the Special Rapporteur outlines the human rights and humanitarian catastrophe in Myanmar. He also describes the essential and awe-inspiring work being done by Myanmar civil society in the most challenging of circumstances. He calls on the international community to view Myanmar civil society as a vital partner in addressing the crisis in the country, working with grassroots networks to deliver aid and increasing financial and technical support to civil society organizations., Myanmar’s fate depends on the activists, organizations, and networks that have risen up to defy military rule, defend human rights, and prepare for a free and democratic future. They need and deserve a significant increase in support from the international community.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/report-special-rapporteur-situation-human-rights-myanmar-thomas-h-andrews-a772955-advanced-unedited-version
Myanmar: Military Used Japan-Funded Ships [EN/JA],News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,11 Oct 2022,"Tokyo Should Immediately Suspend Non-Humanitarian Aid to Junta, (Tokyo) – Myanmar’s junta used Japan-funded passenger ships donated for civilian use for military purposes in September 2022, Human Rights Watch said today., Letters from Myanmar officials, analyzed by Human Rights Watch, stated that two of three vessels delivered by Japan between 2017 and 2019 were used to transport more than 100 soldiers and material to the town of Buthidaung on the Mayu River in Rakhine State, where the military is fighting the Arakan Army ethnic armed group. The Japanese government should suspend non-humanitarian aid to Myanmar and sanction junta officials implicated in serious human rights violations., “The Myanmar junta’s misuse of Japanese development aid for military purposes effectively makes Japan a backer of the junta’s military operations,” said Teppei Kasai, Asia program officer at Human Rights Watch. “The Japanese government needs to urgently reassess its obviously failing approach to curtailing the junta’s abuses.”, On September 13, 2022, the Rakhine State government’s transport minister ordered the Rakhine Department of the Inland Water Transport (IWT) to “ready” the Japan-provided “Kisapanadi I” and “Kisapanadi III” vessels for “Sittwe-Buthidaung-Sittwe voyages,” said a letter labeled confidential from the national IWT to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, on September 21. The letter stated that, on September 14, the two ships transported “over a hundred Tatmadaw [Myanmar] troops, as well as their supplies and materials” to Buthidaung., The transport minister “instructed that the voyages were top secret and that their destination was also classified and no report [to a third party] should be made,” the letter said. Evidently recognizing that this was problematic, IWT noted that it “already had a discussion” with the Rakhine transport minister and “the vessels are no longer used for [military] purposes.”, On September 23, the Rakhine State chief of police and the transport minister, on behalf of Rakhine State’s chief minister, wrote to the national transport and communications minister and specifically confirmed that the two vessels had been used for “military purposes.” In the letter, the Rakhine authorities sought to justify this use of ships, citing provision no. 250 of Myanmar’s 2008 Constitution, which states that “the Region or State Government shall have the responsibility to assist the Union Government in the preservation of the stability of the Union, community peace and tranquility and prevalence of law and order.”, An informal ceasefire between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army, in place since November 2020, has broken down in recent months. In August, the military reinforced its troops in northern Rakhine State, where fighting has since escalated in intensity and scope, including airstrikes, heavy artillery shelling, and landmine use, with growing civilian casualties., Since mid-August, the military has isolated and terrorized civilians in Rakhine and southern Chin States to weaken the Arakan Army, using abusive means embodied in the military’s longstanding “Four Cuts” policy. The junta has imposed broad new travel restrictions on humanitarian workers, blocked access to roads and waterways, and arbitrarily arrested aid workers, in violation of international humanitarian law., On September 15, the junta issued a directive banning United Nations agencies and international nongovernmental organizations from six Rakhine State townships – Maungdaw, Buthidaung, Rathedaung, Mrauk-U, Minbya, and Myebon – and shut down boat lines and public transportation. The fighting has displaced more than 18,000 people since August, joining over 70,000 others who are internally displaced, many of whom are facing shortages of food and medicine exacerbated by the junta’s restrictions., In response to a Human Rights Watch inquiry on September 20, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said on October 3 that the “Japanese government, based on the principle of ‘avoiding any use of development cooperation for military purposes’ in the Development Cooperation Charter, will work to secure appropriate use of facilities and equipment provided through ODA [Official Development Assistance] programs.” The official added that Japan “is taking appropriate measures regarding the issue in question,” but refrained from disclosing further details because it was a “diplomatic matter.”, Japan provided the three vessels to Myanmar under the 500 million yen (US$3.5 million) Economic and Social Development Programme, signed on September 12, 2016. The Japanese embassy in Myanmar said the program “aims to improve the ability of the water transport in Myanmar and to contribute to the Economic and Social Development of Myanmar, by donating passenger ships for the coastal transport in Rakhine State.”, Following the February 1, 2021 military coup in Myanmar, the Japanese government stated it would refrain from carrying out new non-humanitarian ODA programs in Myanmar, but did not suspend ongoing projects. As of November 2021, Japan had provided about 1.4 trillion yen ($9.6 billion) in loan assistance, 360 billion yen ($2.5 billion) in grant aid, and 100 billion yen ($690 million) in technical assistance to Myanmar., The Japanese government should trigger human rights-based conditions enshrined in its Development Cooperation Charter, which states that “Japan will pay adequate attention to the situation in the recipient countries regarding the process of democratization, the rule of law and the protection of basic human rights, with a view to promoting the consolidation of democratization, the rule of law and the respect for basic human rights.”, With respect to humanitarian aid, Japan should maintain such projects but redirect the funds through nongovernmental groups to ensure it is used effectively and directly benefits populations in need, Human Rights Watch said., “Japan’s halfhearted approach to sanctions has not slowed down the Myanmar junta’s abuses at all,” Kasai said. “Japan should make full use of its reputation as a rights-respecting democracy by using all diplomatic tools available to hold the Myanmar military accountable.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-military-used-japan-funded-ships-enja

As of 3 October 2022, there were an estimated 1,349,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) across the country, including 1,019,00 people who have been newly displaced within the country since 1 February 2021., In Rakhine and Chin (South) States, the security situation has progressively worsened with increased clashes reported in northern Maungdaw, northern Rathedaung, southern Buthidaung and Kyauktaw, Minbya and Paletwa Townships. Since August 2022, some 18,417 have been newly displaced due to conflict, according to the latest UN figures. Several incidents, arbitrary arrests and detentions have also been reported. Increased checkpoints on roads and waterways continue to impact communities’ security and freedom of movement., Stricter restrictions on the transportation of goods in villages in Maungdaw, Rakhine State (North), were also reported, resulting in shortages of food, medicine and other essential items.
Non-displaced communities, notably the Rohingya, face further movement restrictions and barriers to assistance, including access to life-saving healthcare and livelihoods. On 15 September, de facto authorities issued instructions calling for humanitarian actors and service providers to suspend activities in Buthidaung, Maungdaw, Rathedaung, MraukU, Minbya and Myebon. This recent development is likely to exacerbate existing vulnerabilities caused by the increased security and limited freedom of movement., In the South-East, armed clashes continued to generate displacement, largely due to the deterioration of the security situation in Mon, Kayah and Kayin States and Bago (East) and Tanintharyi Regions. A lack of food and essential medicine remain a concern in Kayah State.
Security checks and roadblocks continue to impact freedom of movement., In the North-West, the situation remains volatile. The use of artillery fire, aerial attacks and landmines continue to pose risks to civilian safety in Chin State, Magway and Sagaing Regions. The movement of people and transportation of various goods, including food, medicine and fuel, across main roads has also been affected due to the presence of security checkpoints, active armed conflict and landmines. The price of fuel and other basic commodities have also risen as many people become more isolated because of the limited freedom of movement caused by the heightened insecurity., In Kachin and Shan (North), tensions were high. Theft, robbery, extortion, indiscriminate attacks, including explosions in public areas or buildings, pose risks to displaced populations and host communities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-emergency-update-3-october-2022

Movement restrictions are being imposed as a result of continuing clashes between the Arakan Army and Myanmar Armed Forces, severely affecting humanitarian interventions and the ability of aid workers to reach the affected population. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) reports that almost 13,400 people have been newly displaced in the region as of 26 September., Although the UNICEF nutrition programme is facing a funding gap of 85 per cent, implementing partners have been able to reach 32,119 children aged 6–59 months (15,821 girls) with preventive nutrition services, including multiple micronutrient powder and vitamin A supplementation., Funding Overview and Partnerships, UNICEF Myanmar Country Office is appealing for US$151.4 million to deliver humanitarian assistance to displaced people and host communities across the country. The Myanmar Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) estimates that, in 2022, 14.4 million people including 5 million children, need assistance. During September 2022, UNICEF has received generous contributions from the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/BHA), the European Commission’s Humanitarian Office (ECHO), the German Federal Foreign Office, the Global Thematic Fund, the Government of Denmark, the Government of Japan, the Government of Norway, the Korean Committee for UNICEF and UNOCHA., UNICEF Myanmar has so far received US$34.13 million, representing an increase of US$2.2 million from the previous reporting period. The funds received contribute to delivering much needed assistance through UNICEF programmes covering: Nutrition, Health, HIV/AIDS, Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Education, Child Protection, Genderbased violence in emergencies (GBViE), Protection of sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA), Social protection,
Accountability affected population (AAP) and Cluster coordination. UNICEF continues to respond to the Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) appeal but experienced an overall funding gap of 77 per cent that significantly affects the provision of humanitarian assistance and services to the targeted populations, especially children in need. UNICEF can scale up responses and accelerate service deliveries to the targeted population with continued support from donors.
UNICEF expresses its sincere appreciation to all private and public sector donors for their contributions to supporting the children of Myanmar., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, The escalating conflict and violence, rising poverty and a struggling economy due to inflation continues to severely affect children and families across Myanmar. As of 26 September, the conflict has displaced 1,347,400 people, including an estimated 471,590 children, who need critical humanitarian assistance. More than half of the displaced population is in Sagaing region, accounting for 545,200 people, where the volatility of the situation and active military operations continue to trigger displacements. On 16 September, in Tabayin township of Sagaing, at least 11 children died in an air strike and from indiscriminate fire in civilian areas, including a school, while another 15 children from the same school are still missing. Humanitarian actors are facing significant challenges posed by security risks in the northwest, particularly as there is a need to provide immediate assistance to children and communities there. In September,
UNICEF conducted a field assessment in some parts of the northwest to evaluate the operational environment and hopes that the recently established subnational inter-cluster coordination group will contribute to increasing coordinated efforts in response to the local needs., The protracted humanitarian situation in Rakhine continues to deteriorate due to resurgence of conflict between the Arakan Army and the Myanmar Armed Forces, severely affecting the lives of thousands of children and their families.
People who have been displaced for a long time are confined in camps with limited access to health care, water and sanitation facilities, school or a livelihood, while increased population displacements have been reported from rural to urban areas. According to the latest OCHA figures, an estimated 13,400 people have been newly displaced across Rakhine as of 26 September. Humanitarian assistance is extremely challenged by movement restrictions and security measures, preventing access to the affected population. UNICEF and partners are monitoring the situation and have revised contingency plans and supplies, to respond in the event of further deterioration of the humanitarian situation., In the southeast, conflict was also reported in Loikaw township in Kayah, resulting in civilian casualties and displacement.
At the end of September, UNICEF was able to reach the area and directly distribute much needed supplies, including WASH, child protection, health and nutrition. A total of 21,095 people (4,736 households) from 48 displacement sites in Loikaw and Demoso township were assisted, as a follow-up to the initial distribution held by UNICEF last June.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-myanmar-humanitarian-situation-report-no-8-1-30-september-2022

New displacements mainly occurred in Kayin State after reported clashes in Kyainseikgyi Township. Some 1,000 people fled to nearby villages within the township for safety while airstrikes and shelling took place.
Clashes between the Tatmadaw and local armed groups were also reported in several village tracts in Tanintharyi Township, Tanintharyi Region, leading to displacements of 300 individu-als towards Tanintharyi town. Some of the IDPs are staying at markets without proper shelter.
UNHCR and partners were able to verify the situa-tion of IDPs in Nyaung Shwe Township in Shan State (South) where about 160 IDPs from Pekon Township were displaced in May 2022.

Civil society organization in Myanmar wins the regional Nansen Refugee Award [EN/MY],News and Press Release,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,4 Oct 2022,"UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency is pleased to share that Meikswe Myanmar has been selected by an independent selection committee as this year’s regional winner of the Nansen Refugee Award in the Asia region., Meikswe Myanmar is a civil society organization operating in several states and regions in Myanmar. It serves a diverse range of vulnerable groups from people living with HIV to internally displaced people and their host communities., Meikswe Myanmar has been named a regional winner of the Nansen Refugee Award in recognition of their longstanding commitment to aiding and empowering communities uprooted by conflict. It also acknowledges their contributions in supporting and building the capacity of local organizations to effectively respond to the needs of displaced populations and host communities., Founded in 2004, Meikswe Myanmar – meaning Friends of Myanmar - implements a range of activities to support internally displaced people, their host communities and other vulnerable groups in close to 300 locations across six states and regions, namely Kayin, Rakhine and Shan States as well as Magway, Mandalay and Yangon Regions., “Our value is the focus on fragile and forgotten communities that are often in hard-to-access areas, as well as minority groups,” said Naw Bway Khu, Meikswe Myanmar’s founder., The award highlights the crucial role of local organizations in responding to growing humanitarian needs in Myanmar., “First responders are often local communities and grassroots organizations. Rapid humanitarian action would not be possible without them”, said Hai Kyung Jun, UNHCR’s Representative in Myanmar. “Humanitarian assistance undertaken by the international aid agencies like UNHCR complements what resourceful local organizations like Meikswe Myanmar are already doing on the ground to help those in need.”, Meikswe Myanmar’s programming is centered on long-term, bottom-up philosophies of empowerment and resilience, grounded in community needs. Emphasis is placed on supporting women and girls in particular., “Communities are a fundamental building block of society. If they have strength, knowledge, and systems that enable them to progress, our country can also develop,” said Naw Bway Khu., Keeping to its grassroots spirit, Meikswe also maintains close partnerships with a growing network of over 80 local organizations across Myanmar, acting a bridge between them and international organizations as well as donors that can provide resources. Additionally, trainings are provided by Meikswe, so that local organizations are capacitated to mount effective emergencies responses in times of crisis., Established in 1954, the award is named for the late Fridtjof Nansen, a Norwegian diplomat, scientist, polar explorer and humanitarian who went on to serve as the first High Commissioner for Refugees for the League of Nations and won the 1922 Nobel Peace Prize. 2022 marks the 100th anniversary of his award., The Nansen Refugee Award is an annual award that honours individuals, groups and organizations who go above and beyond the call of duty to protect and assist forcibly displaced and stateless people.

Emergency response to COVID-19 has impacted internal migrants in Shwe Pyi Thar Township,News and Press Release,PIN,"Food and Nutrition
Shelter and Non-Food Items",26 Sep 2022,"The global COVID-19 pandemic and political instability have negatively impacted the people of Myanmar in many aspects, especially internal migrant workers and their families who are vulnerable during this hard time. The Shwe Pyi Thar township has been more susceptible to labor exploitation and poor health and nutritional conditions., To support the COVID-19 emergency humanitarian response, People in Need (PIN), Helvetas Myanmar, and four consortium partners: Community Development Association (CDA), Medical Action Myanmar (MAM), Solidarity Trade Union Myanmar (STUM), and Myanmar Private TVET Association (MPTA) provided cash and food-based assistance to migrant workers and vulnerable households in Shwe Pyi Thar township between April 2021 and March 2022., Aimed to reduce the vulnerabilities of internal migrants and fulfil their basic needs, PIN and our consortium partners targeted the most vulnerable people based on the circumstances, which included vulnerable households of women-headed families, pregnant and lactating women, women with children under five years, and their families. We also considered dismissed workers and workers who were not fully paid., To cover the challenges of financial problems during the pandemic and political instability in the region, Ma Nwe Nwe Htun, PIN’s consortium coordinator for the Aye Chan Thaw Ein project, explains, “with the consortium partners approaches, PIN, in collaboration with Helvetas Myanmar provided emergency assistance to migrant workers and vulnerable families in Shwe Pyi Thar township. We distributed cash and food-based assistance from April 2021 to March 2022. We faced many challenges during the implementation process; however, we reached 4,470 beneficiaries with 500 food packages and 262.2 million kyats for this assistance.”, A total of 500 vulnerable households received food packages, including fifteen kg of fortified rice, two litres of vegetable oil, 1.6 kg of potatoes, 500 g of iodised salt, 1.6 kg of chickpeas, 1.6 kg of onions, three pieces of soap and 15,000 kyats of cash assistance., Ko Win Htut Thein, a Project Manager with the group Community Development Association (CDA), expressed his gratitude to PIN and LIFT for funding the provision of cash and food-based assistance at the community level. “With this emergency response, CDA targeted women-headed households in wards 1, 21, 23 and 24 in Shwe Pyi Thar township through the provision of cash and food packages. Women and elderly people are the most vulnerable during the COVID-19 and politically instability situation. Some of them find it hard to get a job during the socio-economic instability because of the factory closures and age limitations.”, He added, “we faced many challenges during the pandemic. One of them was getting access to the targeted populations due to restrictions by the local authorities and the Ministry of Health. However, our CDA team and local authorities supported us in many ways in implementing our activities. In total, CDA provided 500 vulnerable households with food packages and 300 households with cash assistance during this hard time.”, Daw Aye Nyein, a 65-year-old, who received cash and food-based assistance under the Aye Chan Thaw Ein project, says. “Thanks to CDA and its donors for providing us with food and cash assistance. With this support, we can go for two or three weeks without considering our income. I have eight family members, most of whom have had no permanent jobs or incomes since the second wave of COVID-19. I save the money for use only for emergency family matters.”, Despite the pandemic and political turmoil that hit the country, dismissed workers and workers who were not fully paid must face various challenges with their families and day-to-day lives. MPTA and STUM provided cash assistance to 2,760 migrants, especially dismissed workers and their families, to fulfil their basic needs and rental fees for their accommodation. Otherwise, money was allocated to accessing healthcare services and medicines for family members needing medical attention., The economic consequences of COVID-19 and factory closures have intensely affected migrant workers and their families. Medical Action Myanmar (MAM) promoted and facilitated access to healthcare services and other related activities of nutrition, childcare, and good hygiene practices with its Health Educators (HE) under the ACTE project. In addition, MAM provided COVID-19 emergency assistance to 910 pregnant and lactating women and women with children under five years with cash assistance., Ma Win Pa Pa (*name changed), living in Shwe Pyi Thar township with four family members, says,* “I am a mother of an 11-month-old boy with lower limb deformities in severe conditions. MAM and its Health Educators team helped us by providing free healthcare services for my son and transferred him to the hospital for further treatment. And also, I received 50,000 kyats as emergency response assistance. I used the money for my child’s medication and bought nutritious foods to feed my son. I am thankful to ACTE project and MAM for this support during the COVID-19 pandemic. I wish we could also get more financial support in the future.”*, The Aye Chan Thaw Ein project has had an important role in empowering labour migrants and aiming to reduce the vulnerabilities of internal migrants and sustainable livelihoods of poor households by helping people to reach their full economic potential, with financial support from Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund (LIFT)., Author: Sone AyePyae, Communication officer for Myanmar",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/emergency-response-covid-19-has-impacted-internal-migrants-shwe-pyi-thar-township

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Oct 2022,"This regular update, covering humanitarian developments up to 26 September, is produced by OCHA Myanmar in collaboration with the Inter-Cluster Coordination Group and UN agencies. The next humanitarian update will be issued at the end of October 2022., HIGHLIGHTS & KEY MESSAGES, Hostilities and soaring inflation continue to impose security and protection risks on affected and displaced people., More than 1.3 million people remain displaced across the country, of whom more than 1 million were displaced since the 2021 military takeover., Of particular concern is the escalation in fighting between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and the Arakan Army (AA) in Rakhine state and southern Chin, which has displaced more than 17,400 people since August and prompted movement restrictions that are delaying the delivery of critical assistance, particularly food and nutrition support., More areas are being contaminated with landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERWs) due to active fighting in Rakhine and other areas, threatening the lives of people seeking safety or returning to their places of origin., Inflation in the costs of basic commodities and the rapid devaluation of the Myanmar Kyat, continue to limit individual purchasing power and the ability of farmers to plant and grow food. As a result, there are continued concerns about food affordability and availability in the upcoming lean season., Intensifying armed conflict and access restrictions are obstructing the transportation of medical supplies and mobile clinic activities, particularly in Rakhine and Kayah states. Malaria drugs are critically needed in light of increasing cases due to the monsoon season., Humanitarian partners have continued to respond to new needs, reaching 3.1 million people with at least one form of assistance in the first half year of 2022. However, a shortfall in funding and access constraints have hindered partners from delivering the range of relief required, leading to significant unmet needs., The 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) is only 20 per cent funded, leaving a gap of US$660 million (FTS). Partners are consequently being forced to make tough decisions about prioritization of their assistance. Worryingly, funding remains below 2021 levels despite a dramatic increase in needs in 2022., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Ongoing hostilities, insecurity, economic stress and soaring inflation are significantly impacting the lives, movement and safety of conflict-affected people across the country. The conflict has led to the deaths of more than 2,316 people, including an estimated 188 children, and has caused injury to thousands of others. Between January and July 2022 alone, UNICEF recorded 206 casualties from landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW). The actual number is likely to be higher due to underreporting as a result of access constraints, insecurity, and telecommunication challenges. More than 1 million people have been internally displaced since the 2021 military takeover, bringing the total number of internally displaced people (IDPs) to more than 1.3 million across the country, as of 26 September 2022, according to latest UN figures., Local and international humanitarian partners have been rapidly scaling up efforts to respond to pre-existing and emerging needs using creative approaches to overcome access constraints. During the first half of 2022, partners reached 3.1 million people with assistance at least once which represents half of the target for the year. However, access constraints and underfunding have meant this assistance is often intermittent and does not cover the full range of people’s needs. Immediate removal of access obstacles, particularly in conflict areas, and increased funding to the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan are urgently needed for humanitarian partners to respond to escalating needs, provide protection and alleviate suffering., Escalating conflict in Rakhine and Southern Chin prompts severe access restrictions for humanitarian partners, Fighting between the AA-MAF has continued across Rakhine State and Paletwa Township in Chin State. Since August, more than 17,400 people have been newly displaced, bringing the total number of internally displaced people (IDPs) from past and present AA-MAF fighting in these areas to more than 91,000, according to UN latest figures. The use of heavy weapons, airstrikes, landmines and mortar shelling has been seen in multiple townships, mainly in Maungdaw, Rathedaung and Buthidaung in northern Rakhine; and Mrauk-U, Kyauktaw, and Minbya in central Rakhine. In a new dynamic, conflict between the AA and the MAF has also spread to southern Rakhine. Amid fears about inter-communal tension, arbitrary arrests, indiscriminate attacks, and destruction to private property, many people have left their villages., One mother who fled her village in Mrauk-U township describes the situation. “I had experienced and witnessed military troops shooting [in random] directions during the armed conflicts. That is why, when our village was hit by heavy artillery in early morning, we fled”. When she arrived at Ywar Thit Kay displacement site with nothing, she received humanitarian assistance and was provided with a cooking set and other essential items but like others at this site, she still needs food and shelter. There are concerns about the safety of returns, with the de facto authorities reportedly pushing people displaced from AA-MAF conflict to go back to their places of origin before October of this year even as fighting continues., Local and international humanitarian partners have been working to meet the basic needs of affected people however access to displaced people has become increasingly difficult. Security measures have tightened in many areas across the state; waterways and roads have become blocked in northern Rakhine; and the transportation of medical supplies and food has been restricted into Paletwa. These measures have limited people’s movement and are obstructing the delivery of humanitarian assistance. On 15 September, the de facto authorities prohibited the UN and INGOs from accessing six key townships - Buthidaung, Maungdaw, Rathedaung, Mrauk-U, Minbya, Myebon - until further notice. Access requests to the other 11 townships in Rakhine continue to be processed but food and nutrition activities continue to face problems. These service and supply interruptions are compounding the suffering of affected people who depend on humanitarian support for their survival. The movement restrictions have also prompted concerns about commercial shortages and surging prices for key commodities, including food, in some areas. The UN is advocating for restrictions to be eased for humanitarian activities and for expedited access through checkpoints for humanitarian actors delivering critical assistance. In addition, funding is urgently required to address needs and overcome contingency supply shortages. Since May, the United League of Arakan/Arakan Army (ULA/AA) has also been pushing to introduce a parallel registration and travel notification system for humanitarian actors in Rakhine and this has resulted in additional interference in the implementation of humanitarian activities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-update-no-22-1-october-2022

"Andaman Sea: As movements from Myanmar and Bangladesh resume, safe routes are needed to avoid another crisis",News and Press Release,MMC,Protection and Human Rights,22 Aug 2022,"By Hanh Nguyen, Themba Lewis, On 24 May 2022, at least 17 Rohingya refugees were killed after their boat capsized in bad weather off the Myanmar coast. Children drowned. The victims were among some 90 Rohingya on board who were attempting to leave Sittwe – the capital of Rakhine state in Myanmar – for Malaysia. The number of journeys had fallen significantly early in the COVID-19 pandemic but have resumed in recent months, and these deaths are a tragic justification of increasing concerns for those taking the sea journey to Malaysia., Observers fear that countries including Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia, are taking harsher measures to cope with the “irregular” movements of people. Hundreds of Rohingya have been intercepted in Myanmar and Bangladesh while many others have been arrested elsewhere en route to Malaysia. These events, despite happening on a smaller scale, mirror the movements and responses around the Andaman Sea crisis of 2015 as authorities continue criminalizing refugees and the seeking of protection from persecution., Mixed movements resumed from Bangladesh and Myanmar to Malaysia, According to UNODC, more than 900 Rohingya have attempted to reach Malaysia since December, exceeding the number from the same period last year (633, according to UNHCR). Smugglers in Bangladesh and Myanmar usually facilitate the journeys, which can include both land border crossings and maritime movements. Refugees are exposed to fatal risks during those journeys, especially women and children. According to a source quoted by Radio Free Asia, “about 35 out of 100 people make it”. The rest are either arrested or lose their lives. From December 2021 to date, more than 600 Rohingya have been arrested on the journey to Malaysia, and according to UNODC at least 65 reported dead or missing., Unlike maritime movements during 2020-2021, which were made up of Rohingya only, recent boats from Bangladesh and Myanmar to Malaysia consist of Rohingya, other Myanmar nationals, and Bangladeshis. A boat captured by the Malaysian authorities in Kuala Kurau on 1 May 2022, for example, held 143 people, including 134 Rohingya, four Bangladeshi nationals, and five Myanmar nationals. This kind of mixed movement, despite being on a much smaller scale, also mirrors the movements in the Andaman Sea seven years ago, when as many as 8,000 Rohingya refugees and Bangladeshi migrants were left stranded at sea after being refused disembarkation by Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand., Anti-refugee rhetoric continues to offset regional protection frameworks, Compared with seven years ago, regional frameworks to protect refugees and migrants have improved. The Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime provides a platform for collaboration on the establishment of disembarkation options and cooperation in search and rescue efforts. ASEAN has also provided various frameworks to strengthen protection for migrant workers and victims of human trafficking, especially women and children., However, the regional frameworks have yet been able to energize member states to protect the rights of people on the move, and changes in national immigration policy have been limited. Australia reaffirmed the continuation of its “turning back boats” policy despite the electoral victory of the Labour Party in May 2022. Thailand continues its view of refugees as “illegal” migrants, while every country on the route remains a non-signatory to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, shying away from any responsibilities toward refugees., Furthermore, anti-refugee and anti-immigrant rhetoric have been on the rise. In Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Myanmar, reports on Rohingya refugees being arrested and detained have proliferated, using dehumanizing and inaccurate language – such as “illegal migrants”, “criminal tendencies”, and “nabbing”. These reports have stoked public opposition to migrants and refugees. At the same time, countries like Malaysia and Thailand have increased immigration raids, resulting in the arrest and deportation of refugees, including those with UNHCR-issued refugee cards: an act in violation of international law., What lessons from the Andaman Sea crisis are still applied to today’s responses?, The Andaman Sea crisis in 2015 demonstrates the complexity of mixed movements as well as the responses required. Boats traveling to Malaysia are carrying people who have different legal statuses and who are departing for a variety of reasons. Regardless of these differences, people in mixed movements are exposed to the same protection risks and violations on the journey. These risks are only heightened in the absence of a comprehensive legal protection framework in transit and destination countries., These movements of Rohingya refugees also prove that without proper attention to conditions for Rohingya in Myanmar and Bangladesh, movement is inevitable, as they seek to avoid humanitarian and migration crises. In Myanmar, ten years after the launch of the ethnic cleansing campaign targeting the Rohingya population, the condition of people held in the Rohingya displacement camp in Sittwe remains critical, with debt, lack of employment, and a generation of education-less children damaging Rohingya communities. In Bangladesh, movements in Cox’s Bazar have been increasingly restricted. Since May 2022, the local police have introduced a new “camp-to-camp movement pass”, which is required for Rohingya to visit other camps. Those who travel without the pass are reportedly detained and beaten. Additionally, three months after shutting down thousands of shops owned by refugees, in April 2022 Bangladesh authorities detained more than 300 Rohingya for working outside their refugee camps. Given the dim prospects of repatriation and resettlement, and worsening conditions in Bangladesh, moving onwards is the only option for many., How can the region respond better this time?, In a statement on 23 May, UNHCR warned that “collective failure to act will continue to lead to tragic and fatal consequences” for those at sea, citing the deaths of the 17 Rohingya. The warning is ominous, pointing directly at predictable and amendable failures in protection response, while adding that Rohingya refugees will continue to embark on dangerous journeys in search of safety and stability, and in increasing numbers. Although the overall number of Rohingya attempting to reach Malaysia from Myanmar and Bangladesh over the past few months remains significantly lower than in May 2015, the situation is volatile and can change quickly at any time., Given the drivers of onward movement, increasing border controls and criminalizing refugees will increase the risks of the journey, more than it will stop people from moving. Countries on the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea must cooperate to conduct search and rescue operations to save lives. Refugees who flee persecution and catastrophic conditions in Myanmar and Bangladesh should be allowed to disembark and provided with adequate assistance. States in the region should urgently agree on collective solutions to address the issue and better share responsibility for hosting refugees.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/andaman-sea-movements-myanmar-and-bangladesh-resume-safe-routes-are-needed-avoid-another-crisis

The Social Atrocity: Meta and the right to remedy for the Rohingya,Analysis,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,29 Sep 2022,"MYANMAR: FACEBOOK’S SYSTEMS PROMOTED VIOLENCE AGAINST ROHINGYA; META OWES REPARATIONS, Facebook owner Meta’s dangerous algorithms and reckless pursuit of profit substantially contributed to the atrocities perpetrated by the Myanmar military against the Rohingya people in 2017, Amnesty International said in a new report published today., The Social Atrocity: Meta and the right to remedy for the Rohingya, details how Meta knew or should have known that Facebook’s algorithmic systems were supercharging the spread of harmful anti-Rohingya content in Myanmar, but the company still failed to act., “In 2017, the Rohingya were killed, tortured, raped, and displaced in the thousands as part of the Myanmar security forces’ campaign of ethnic cleansing. In the months and years leading up to the atrocities, Facebook’s algorithms were intensifying a storm of hatred against the Rohingya which contributed to real-world violence,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General., “While the Myanmar military was committing crimes against humanity against the Rohingya, Meta was profiting from the echo chamber of hatred created by its hate-spiralling algorithms., “Meta must be held to account. The company now has a responsibility to provide reparations to all those who suffered the violent consequences of their reckless actions.”, Sawyeddollah, a 21-year-old Rohingya refugee, told Amnesty International: “I saw a lot of horrible things on Facebook. And I just thought that the people who posted that were bad… Then I realized that it is not only these people – the posters – but Facebook is also responsible. Facebook is helping them by not taking care of their platform.”, The Rohingya are a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority based in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine State. In August 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya fled Rakhine when the Myanmar security forces launched a targeted campaign of widespread and systematic murder, rape and burning of homes. The violence followed decades of state-sponsored discrimination, persecution, and oppression against the Rohingya that amounts to apartheid., AN ANTI-ROHINGYA ECHO CHAMBER, Meta uses engagement-based algorithmic systems to power Facebook’s news feed, ranking, recommendation and groups features, shaping what is seen on the platform. Meta profits when Facebook users stay on the platform as long as possible, by selling more targeted advertising. The display of inflammatory content – including that which advocates hatred, constituting incitement to violence, hostility and discrimination – is an effective way of keeping people on the platform longer. As such, the promotion and amplification of this type of content is key to the surveillance-based business model of Facebook., In the months and years prior to the crackdown, Facebook in Myanmar had become an echo chamber of anti-Rohingya content. Actors linked to the Myanmar military and radical Buddhist nationalist groups flooded the platform with anti-Muslim content, posting disinformation claiming there was going to be an impending Muslim takeover, and portraying the Rohingya as “invaders”., In one post that was shared more than 1,000 times, a Muslim human rights defender was pictured and described as a “national traitor”. The comments left on the post included threatening and racist messages, including ‘He is a Muslim. Muslims are dogs and need to be shot’, and ‘Don’t leave him alive. Remove his whole race. Time is ticking’., Content inciting violence and discrimination went to the very top of Myanmar’s military and civilian leadership. Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of Myanmar’s military, posted on his Facebook page in 2017: “We openly declare that absolutely, our country has no Rohingya race.” He went on to seize power in a coup in February 2021., In July 2022, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that it has jurisdiction to proceed with a case against the Myanmar government under the Genocide Convention based on Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya. Amnesty International welcomes this vital step towards holding the Myanmar government to account and continues to call for senior members of the Myanmar military to be brought to justice for their role in crimes against the Rohingya., In 2014, Meta attempted to support an anti-hate initiative known as ‘Panzagar’ or ‘flower speech’ by creating a sticker pack for Facebook users to post in response to content which advocated violence or discrimination. The stickers bore messages such as, ‘Think before you share’ and ‘Don’t be the cause of violence’., However, activists soon noticed that the stickers were having unintended consequences. Facebook’s algorithms interpreted the use of these stickers as a sign that people were enjoying a post and began promoting them. Instead of diminishing the number of people who saw a post advocating hatred, the stickers actually made the posts more visible., The UN’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar ultimately concluded that the “role of social media [was] significant” in the atrocities in a country where “Facebook is the Internet”., Mohamed Showife, a Rohingya activist, said: “The Rohingya just dream of living in the same way as other people in this world… but you, Facebook, you destroyed our dream.”, FACEBOOK'S FAILURE TO ACT, The report details how Meta repeatedly failed to conduct appropriate human rights due diligence on its operations in Myanmar, despite its responsibility under international standards to do so., Internal studies dating back to 2012 indicated that Meta knew its algorithms could result in serious real-world harms. In 2016, Meta’s own research clearly acknowledged that “our recommendation systems grow the problem” of extremism., Meta received repeated communications and visits by local civil society activists between 2012 and 2017 when the company was warned that it risked contributing to extreme violence. In 2014, the Myanmar authorities even temporarily blocked Facebook because of the platform’s role in triggering an outbreak of ethnic violence in Mandalay. However, Meta repeatedly failed to heed the warnings, and also consistently failed to enforce its own policies on hate speech., Amnesty International’s investigation includes analysis of new evidence from the ‘Facebook Papers’ – a cache of internal documents leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen., In one internal document dated August 2019, one Meta employee wrote: “We have evidence from a variety of sources that hate speech, divisive political speech, and misinformation on Facebook… are affecting societies around the world. We also have compelling evidence that our core product mechanics, such as virality, recommendations, and optimizing for engagement, are a significant part of why these types of speech flourish on the platform.”, ‘META MUST PAY’, Amnesty International is today launching a new campaign calling for Meta Platforms, Inc. to meet the Rohingya’s demands for remediation., Today marks the first anniversary of the murder of prominent activist Mohib Ullah, chair of the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights. Mohib was at the forefront of community efforts to hold Meta accountable., Rohingya refugee groups have made direct requests to Meta to provide remedy by funding a USD $1 million education project in the refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. The funding request represents just 0.002% of Meta’s profits of $46.7 billion from 2021. In February 2021, Meta rejected the Rohingya community’s request, stating: “Facebook doesn’t directly engage in philanthropic activities.”, Showkutara, a 22-year-old Rohingya woman and youth activist, told Amnesty International: “Facebook must pay. If they do not, we will go to every court in the world. We will never give up in our struggle.”, There are at least three active complaints seeking remediation for the Rohingya from Meta. Civil legal proceedings were filed against the company in December 2021 in both the United Kingdom and the USA. Rohingya refugee youth groups have also filed an OECD case against Meta which is currently under consideration by the US’ OECD National Contact Point., MYANMAR: FACEBOOK’S SYSTEMS PROMOTED VIOLENCE AGAINST ROHINGYA; META OWES REPARATIONS, “Meta has a responsibility under international human rights standards to remediate the terrible harm suffered by the Rohingya that they contributed to. The findings should raise the alarm that Meta risks contributing to further serious human rights abuses, unless it makes fundamental changes to its business model and algorithms,” said Agnès Callamard., “Urgent, wide-ranging reforms to their algorithmic systems to prevent abuses and increase transparency are desperately needed to ensure that Meta’s history with the Rohingya does not repeat itself elsewhere in the world, especially where ethnic violence is simmering.”, “Ultimately, States must now help to protect human rights by introducing and enforcing effective legislation to rein in surveillance-based business models across the technology sector. Big Tech has proven itself incapable of doing so when it has such enormous profits at stake.”, On 20 May 2022, Amnesty International wrote to Meta regarding the company’s actions in relation to its business activities in Myanmar before and during the 2017 atrocities. **Meta responded **that it could not provide information concerning the period leading up to 2017 because the company is “currently engaged in litigation proceedings in relation to related matters”., On 14 June 2022, Amnesty International again wrote to Meta regarding the relevant allegations contained in the report, and to give the company the opportunity to respond. Meta declined to comment.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/social-atrocity-meta-and-right-remedy-rohingya
"Opportunities and constraints for production and income growth in rural Myanmar: Inter-regional variations in the composition of agriculture, livelihoods, and the rural economy [EN/MY]",Analysis,IFPRI,Agriculture,28 Sep 2022,"ABSTRACT, This working paper synthesizes findings from four large household and community surveys in Myanmar, each covering a major agro-ecological zone, to evaluate inter-regional variations in the composition of agriculture, livelihoods, and the rural economy, and prospects for production and income growth. We find the following:, With the partial exception of paddy, most field crop production is strongly commercially oriented, and most farmers are well-integrated into markets., Grain crops perform less well than elsewhere in Southeast Asia, suggesting the existence of large yield and income gaps. However, climatic variability may dissuade investments at what appear to be economically optimal levels of input use, and the highly unequal distribution of agricultural land means that most yield and income gains associated with improved agricultural technologies accrue to larger farms. Expansion of decentralized small-scale groundwater irrigation services may reduce agricultural risk and support intensification, particularly in the Dry Zone., Production of higher value, more labor and input intensive crops, such as fish, poultry, and some fruits, has potential to create spillovers through employment linkages on-farm and upstream and downstream in value chains. There are numerous examples of farmers in Myanmar rapidly taking up production of new commercial crops that appear to offer an advantage. However, potential for agricultural diversification is highly contextually specific and can be risky., Rural livelihoods are increasingly diversified. There is a positive association between landownership and income in all zones surveyed, but the most direct pathways to income growth and economic and social mobility often lie off-farm., Migration has accelerated rapidly since 2011, reducing the availability of labor and bidding up rural wages. This has been advantageous for land-poor households who depend disproportionally on sales of labor for their income., Economic reforms and investments in rural infrastructure and public services since 2011 have played a pivotal role in the emergence of an increasingly dynamic rural non-farm economy. Increasingly, there is a need for these to be accompanied by investments in human capacity development, expansion of social safety nets, and social protection to buffer against shocks, such as COVID-19, and to protect vulnerable people from being left behind.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/opportunities-and-constraints-production-and-income-growth-rural-myanmar-inter-regional-variations-composition-agriculture-livelihoods-and-rural-economy-enmy
School attack in Let Yet Kone village may be considered a war crime with commanders criminally liable – Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar,News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",27 Sep 2022,"Geneva, 27 September 2022 – The Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar is collecting evidence concerning the recent sustained attack on a school located in Let Yet Kone village, Sagaing Region, to assess criminal responsibility. At least 12 people are reported to have been killed, including several children., Multiple reports indicate that the school, located in the compound of a monastery, came under attack by Tatmadaw forces for several hours on 16 September – first from helicopters firing rockets and machine-guns, followed by an infantry attack., Armed attacks that target civilians are prohibited by international laws of war and can be punished as war crimes or crimes against humanity., Tatmadaw spokesperson, Major General Zaw Min Htun, has claimed that the attack on Let Yet Kone did not target civilians but rather Kachin Independence Army and People’s Defence Force soldiers thought to be present at the school. However, even if this was the case and the armed attack had a military objective, it is prohibited according to the laws of war if it is expected to result in civilian injuries or deaths that are excessive in relation to the expected direct military advantage achieved by the attack., Commanders who decide to launch a military attack in proximity to civilians have three specific obligations under international law. They must do everything possible to verify the existence of the military objectives; take all practicable precautions in the choice of methods and means of warfare to avoid or minimize harm to civilians; and must not launch attacks which may be expected to cause disproportionate civilian casualties or civilian property damage., Commanders who intentionally or recklessly disregard these obligations in ordering or launching an attack may be criminally liable, as would be any soldiers or pilots who follow orders to carry out what they must know, given the circumstances, to be a disproportionate attack., Schools are places where civilians – including children – are typically present in large numbers. Commanders must therefore take special care to confirm the existence and nature of any possible military target, assess the number of civilians in the area, and adopt means and methods to minimize the risk of harm to them., Information on how to communicate securely with the Mechanism about this or other serious international crimes that may have been committed in Myanmar can be found at iimm.un.org/contact-us/. Please avoid taking unnecessary risks that may compromise safety, and only communicate with us via secure channels., The Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM or Mechanism) was created by the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2018 to collect and analyse evidence of the most serious international crimes and other violations of international law committed in Myanmar since 2011. It aims to facilitate justice and accountability by preserving and organizing this evidence and preparing case files for use in future prosecutions of those responsible in national, regional and international courts., For more information visit https://iimm.un.org/",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/school-attack-let-yet-kone-village-may-be-considered-war-crime-commanders-criminally-liable-independent-investigative-mechanism-myanmar

On 1 February the Myanmar Armed Forces detained elected political leaders, declared a state of emergency, and transferred all legislative, executive and judicial powers to themselves. Compounded by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the military takeover unleashed a crisis that has resulted in significant human suffering and a reversal of many of the development gains made in recent years. On top of this, Myanmar experienced a severe outbreak of COVID-19 between June and August during which many people lost their lives and the economy was almost brought to a halt., The events at the beginning of the year had significant implications on the work of the UN. As the member states contended with the legitimacy of the de facto authorities, overnight, UN’s operating environment became much more challenging, while the need for UN assistance increased exponentially. To respond to the new and escalating needs, the UN undertook an extensive reprogramming exercise. Funds and programmes were refocused on meeting the humanitarian needs of people, supporting the COVID-19 public health response, and mitigating the impact on the most vulnerable people and communities. To complement the UN’s humanitarian response, two new development programming frameworks were developed: the Health Response Contingency Plan (HRCP); and the Socio-economic Resilience Response Plan (SERRP). Despite the operational challenges, the UN disbursed a total of US$453 million in programmatic expenditures under the two development frameworks and its humanitarian response., Under the HRCP, the UN contributed to the COVID-19 response, promoted continued access to essential health and nutrition services for vulnerable groups, and strengthened logistics and supply chains for immunizations, and reproductive health commodity security. Under the SERRP, the UN supported continued access for vulnerable populations to essential services in areas including social protection, food and nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, education, shelter, and gender-based violence and violence against children. In addition, the UN worked to promote gender-responsive employment, private sector resilience, and strengthen households, communities and micro, small and medium enterprises capacities to weather future shocks. To promote and protect human rights, the rule of law, and the democratic space, the UN supported civil society actors to hold decision makers to account, facilitated access to legal aid, and worked with communities to increase awareness of fundamental and democratic rights., At the time of writing, the situation in Myanmar remains uncertain and the political, socioeconomic, human rights and humanitarian continues. Going forward the UN is determined to strengthen our efforts to serve the people of Myanmar. We will use the lessons learnt in 2021 to ensure that our support becomes increasingly impactful as we keep delivering humanitarian assistance, support the most vulnerable, build resilience, and promote conditions for an inclusive and sustainable recovery when the situation allows. I am confident that through the strength of the people of Myanmar, the country will find its way back on a brighter path., Ramanathan Balakrishnan UN Resident Coordinator a.i./ Humanitarian Coordinator a.i.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/country-results-report-2021-un-myanmar-april-2022

Excellencies,, I welcome the opportunity to provide you with this oral update on the human rights situation in Myanmar, further to Human Rights Council resolution 49/23., Since the last update to this Council in June, the people of Myanmar have been caught in a rapid downward spiral, with growing suffering, fear, and insecurity., Urgent action is needed to reverse this catastrophic situation and to restore peace, democracy, and sustainable development., The Myanmar military’s offensives throughout the country are designed not only to target its opponents but also to punish any communities it deems to be supporting them., Military tactics increasingly involve indiscriminateattacks andweaponry. The growing use of air power and artillery during the monsoon season is significantly impacting civilians and residential areas. In Magway and Sagaing regions as well as Kachin, Shan, Kayah, and Kayin states, residential buildings – as many as 30,000 - schools and other civilian infrastructure have been burnt to the ground during military ground operations., In an emblematic incident documented by OHCHR, on 11 August military forces attacked an armed group presence in Yin Paung Taing village in Sagaing region with jets and helicopters, and then raided the village. Over 100 villagers were arrested, alleged to have been used as human shields and porters by the military. After three days of intense fighting, villagers, including women and children, were found dead, and 20 of those arrested are still missing., In another airstrike in Let Yet Kone village in Sagaing on 16 September the military targeted a school and a nearby monastery killing at least six children and injuring many others, including teachers. Eyewitnesses reported that 11 wounded people, including nine children and two teachers, were taken away and remain missing., Since February 2021, at least 2.316 people (including at least 188 children) have been killed. Widespread fear and insecurity among the civilian population has forced over 1 million individuals (of whom, 45,500 into neighboring countries) to leave their homes and now live in precarious conditions without access to food, medical assistance, and other basic services. The humanitarian crisis now brings fears of starvation, with the military largely denying humanitarian access, including recent orders to halt humanitarian operations in northern and central Rakhine State., Over 15,607 people have been arrested with some 12,464 remaining in detention. The death toll of people in custody is steadily rising. At least 273 persons have died in formal detention settings, such as prisons, detention and interrogation centers, and police stations as well as at least 266 reported deaths following raids and arrests in villages, at least 40 of whom were reportedly killed with headshots., Family members reported seeing signs of physical abuse, ill-treatment, or suspected torture, despite being informed that the death was a result of natural causes. There are 111 reported cases of people being burned, either alive or after being executed, in what appears to be a tactic of summary executions and attempts to destroy evidence of crimes., Myanmar’s military-controlled judicial system has also been weaponized to execute opponents. The military executed four individuals, including a former member of Parliament and a democracy activist, following a secretive military court trial, in violation of fair trial standards and rule of law principles. These executions, which are the first in about thirty years, represent an important indicator of the regression of human rights in Myanmar and the military’s complete disregard for international law., OHCHR has also documented that the military has arrested and charged at least 10 lawyers who were defending people charged with spurious, politically motivated offences., Since February 2021, civic space has been decimated. The military’s announced plans to create a register and impose a new tax on mobile phones will increase the risk of surveillance, further imperilling human rights defenders, journalists and members of the pro-democracy movement. It will also increase the cost of accessing the internet for ordinary people and further restrict freedom of expression and access to information. Just days ago, the military also announced that expressions of solidarity on social media to the National Unity Government and Peoples’ Defense Force, including by posting a “like” or an emoji, risked up to 10 years’ imprisonment., Excellencies,, The relative stability experienced in Rakhine State since the start of the coup has proved very short lived. My office has received reports of killings, injuries, arbitrary detention and mass displacement of civilians resulting from clashes between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army in several townships of Rakhine and Chin State and along the border, with reported cases of shelling into Bangladesh., Minority communities especially Rohingya and Kaman Muslims are particularly vulnerable, with the military imposing new restrictions on delivery of humanitarian aid and essential goods in large areas of Rakhine., Last month marked the fifth anniversary of the military’s 2017 campaign of violence against the Rohingya, involving the killing of thousands and pushing over 740,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh. During the former High Commissioner’s visit to the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar last month, Rohingya refugees shared their hopes of being able to return home when the conditions permit. However, conditions for safe, dignified and sustainable returns are not yet evident. The international community should support Bangladesh in providing protection, education and livelihood opportunities for the refugees, while continuing to pursue international accountability efforts., Despite widespread international condemnation, Myanmar is yet to address the root causes of Rohingya persecution. Rohingya are deprived of citizenship rights and civil documentation, limiting their freedom of movement, and access to health and education services. They face daily extortion by camp authorities, village administrators, police, and military., Most Rohingya in Rakhine live in desperate poverty, driving them, at high risk, to flee Myanmar, often paying large sums of money to human traffickers. United Nations figures indicate that informal attempts to leave and arrests for travelling without authorization doubled in 2022 compared to the previous year. Rohingya are often deprived of adequate legal representation and coerced into accepting guilt in order to avoid longer sentences., Mr. President,, The cycle of violations must end., Unfortunately, diplomatic efforts have so far yielded limited results. I hope the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Myanmar’s recent visit to Myanmar and Bangladesh can build momentum. ASEAN must also reinvigorate its efforts to bring humanitarian support and promote a resolution to the crisis, in consultation with the people’s representatives, and with support from regional powers., I reiterate calls to the military to cease violence, including by imposing a moratorium on executions, to free all political prisoners, to ensure access to humanitarian aid and return Myanmar to democracy based on respect for human rights and the rule of law., I also urge this Council to consider strengthening OHCHR’s existing documentation mandate in order to enhance monitoring of the situation and support accountability efforts, including the work of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/oral-update-human-rights-situation-myanmar-human-rights-council-opening-statement-nada-al-nashif-un-acting-high-commissioner-human-rights

Covid-19, and military restrictions on aid. Among them are Humanitarian Aid Relief Trust (HART)’s partners at the Shan Women’s Action Network (SWAN). SWAN operate on the frontlines of emergency relief in Shan state, along the Thai-Burma border, and in Thailand, where thousands of people are seeking refuge from military campaigns and a new escalation in armed conflicts. Through lifesaving aid, education, healthcare provision, and legal support for women and children in emergency situations, SWAN’s programmes offer a lifeline to minority communities in one of the most isolated regions of Burma.
On 1 February 2021, Humanitarian Aid Relief Trust (HART) and our in-country partners at the Shan Women’s Action Network (SWAN) watched as Burmese military forces seized power from the National League for Democracy1 and raised fears of another conflict in Burma.
Subsequent peaceful protests were met with brutality from security forces and an internet blackout to hide military atrocities from the world’s media. Furthermore, in efforts to suppress the pro-democracy movement, the military adopted a cut-off policy that obstructed essential supplies and lifesaving aid from reaching civilians across the country. HART joined other UK-based aid organisations in calling for the transfer of immediate humanitarian assistance, including unimpeded cross-border access to minority communities and internally displaced peoples (IDPs) in Burma’s ethnic states. Twenty months on, the international community has failed to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in Burma: the inaction of governments around the world has left local actors abandoned, forcing them to respond without the necessary support, resources and security needed to manage a crisis of this scale.
As Burma experiences another violent episode in its decades-long struggle for freedom, its ethnic states are suffering doubly from armed conflicts and legacies of systemic oppression.
While the UK Government recently announced its intention to intervene in the Rohingya genocide case2 before the International Court of Justice, it continues to ignore calls for help from north-eastern Burma and other ethnic states undergoing military offensives. SWAN is one of few cross-border networks offering a lifeline to safety for Shan IDPs and refugees. Now, the fallout from the military coup has placed even greater pressure on their emergency relief programmes and has forced operations to adapt to new security risks. As demands on relief networks like SWAN grow amid mass trauma and displacement, the international community must address the needs of IDPs in Burma. This includes transferring immediate humanitarian assistance and cross-border aid, as well as ensuring the right to protection for ethnic groups and NGOs working with them.
HART works with local partners in Shan, Chin, and Karen states, who believe that Burma’s formal name, Myanmar, which was introduced by the military government3 in 1989, represents state-sponsored policies of ethnic violence against minority groups. HART staff, alongside our in-country partners, refer to the country as Burma. The names of SWAN colleagues, as well as refugees who told us stories of their continuing search for safety, have been withheld for security reasons and to protect the anonymity of those we interviewed. All photos have been shared with the consent of SWAN and those with whom they work.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/crisis-thai-burma-border-shan-womens-action-network-frontlines-emergency-relief-september-2022

Ximena Jativa; Michelle Mills, The COVID-19 pandemic presented an opportunity for governments across Southeast Asia to reshape their approach to education so that children and adolescents are equipped with the necessary academic and socioemotional skills to live a rewarding life. By providing deeper insight into children’s attitudes and values in well-being domains, this report reveals the relationship between children’s well-being and academic learning in the region., What can policymakers and practitioners do to support children and adolescents to excel now and in the future? Through quantitative analysis of the Southeast Asia Primary Learning Metrics 2019 database, along with an investigation of policy implications and promising practices, this report advocates for increased coordination across cross-sectoral government institutions; increased school, parental and community support for children’s development; and providing a platform for children’s voices to understand their perspectives and needs., Developed by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Office of Research-Innocenti and published by UNICEF East Asia and Pacific Regional Office (EAPRO) as its contribution to the SEA-PLM Secretariat., Read the full report.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/innocenti-research-report-what-does-sea-plm-2019-tell-us-about-child-well-being-and-learning-six-southeast-asian-countries

With this new funding, our total assistance in response to the Rohingya Refugee Crisis has reached nearly $1.9 billion since August 2017, when over 740,000 Rohingya were forced to flee to safety in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh., This additional humanitarian assistance includes more than $93 million through the State Department and more than $77 million through USAID. With nearly $138 million for programs specifically in Bangladesh, it provides life-sustaining support to the over 940,000 Rohingya refugees, many of whom are survivors of a campaign of genocide and crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing, and 540,000 generous host community members in Bangladesh. It will enable the provision of food, safe drinking water, health care, protection, education, shelter, and psychosocial support. We urge other donors to contribute robustly to the humanitarian response and increase support to those driven from and affected by violence in Burma., The United States applauds the generosity of the government and people of Bangladesh and other Rohingya-hosting countries in the region. Recognizing that conditions in Burma do not currently allow for the safe, voluntary, dignified, and sustainable return and reintegration of displaced Rohingya, we are working with the Government of Bangladesh, Rohingya, and people within Burma toward finding solutions to the crisis.

Protection and Human Rights",22 Sep 2022,"Mr. President,
Excellencies,, The report on economic interests of the Myanmar military is being presented to you pursuant to Human Rights Council Resolution 46/21, which requested the High Commissioner to report on the status of implementation of the recommendations made by the independent international fact-finding mission on Myanmar (FFM) in its conference room paper (A/HRC/42/CRP.3) on the same subject in September 2019., I will be updating this Council separately on the overall human rights situation in Myanmar on 26 September., In its 2019 report, the FFM concluded that the military’s ability to draw on various sources of revenue enabled its operations, including perpetration of serious international crimes. The FFM called for the Tatmadaw’s financial and economic isolation as a crucial element in pursuing accountability and contributing towards civilian oversight over the military’s actions., Since the FFM report, the human rights situation in Myanmar has become even graver., Further to the military coup of February 2021, the Myanmar military has continued its exploitation of the country’s resources to advance its own interests and fuel a campaign of violence and repression against Myanmar’s people. The Myanmar military has steadily escalated its use of force on cities, towns and villages throughout the country. To date, nearly 2,299 persons, including 188 children, have been killed and nearly 30,000 buildings, including whole villages, schools, churches/places of worship and other protected objects, have been burned to the ground. Such offensives have relied heavily on the use of air power, artillery and other military hardware, being bought and paid for by the profits from the Tatmadaw’s own business interests and exploitation of resources., While there have been some steps taken by various actors following the FFM’s recommendations, particularly since the coup, substantially more can be done to stem the economic resources and supply of arms that enable the military to continue its assault on the Myanmar people., Curtailing the Tatmadaw’s economic interests and, in particular, its access to revenues and foreign exchange are essential elements of preventing the further spiral of human rights violations., In addition, the General Assembly has called on Member States to prevent the flow of arms into the country, and our report urges Member States that have not already done so to impose arms embargos on the Myanmar military., As OHCHR has highlighted in previous reports to this Council, the military has been consistently repressing and terrorizing the country’s population in its attempts to assert full control. These actions have pushed an economy already hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic into a deepening crisis. We have observed a two-fold increase in poverty and the breakdown of the public health system. Also, over half of all school-aged children have not accessed education for two academic years., Despite the dramatic economic, political, financial and social deterioration in the country, the military’s so-called State Administrative Council (SAC) continues to prioritize military operations by increasing defence spending and reducing budget allocations to education, health and social protection. The SAC has failed to govern in meaningful and sustainable ways, including by being unable to raise taxes, and with the local SAC administration collapsing in various parts of the country. This has been compounded by the Myanmar people’s courageous resistance to military rule. For instance, households are refusing to pay electricity bills despite threats of being cut off; and many are boycotting military-linked companies and businesses., Excellencies,, The report shows that since the military coup of 1 February 2021, some companies ended their business relationships with military-owned companies, in line with some FFM recommendations. The coup has further heightened the reputational and other business risks of such relationships, whether for international or Myanmar companies., In parallel, several Member States have introduced further targeted sanctions, including on military leaders, military-owned entities and some State-owned entities now under the direct control of the SAC., However, the military’s continued use of foreign currency to buy arms, particularly, aircraft, aerial munitions, and artillery has enabled its attacks against its opponents including in populated areas, as well as the targeting of civilians and locations protected under international humanitarian and human rights law., The current crisis has also enabled the military to extend and strengthen its patronage networks. It is involved through proxies in illicit extractive activities, for instance increased mining of rare earths in Kachin State, vital for production of “green technologies”, but at a cost of enriching key Tatmadaw allies and devastating the local environment. Given the ongoing non-international armed conflict in the area, this activity warrants further investigation as to the possible war crime of pillaging., Excellencies,, Concerted action is needed now., The report urges the international community to take all steps within its power to support the people of Myanmar and to act in coordinated fashion to financially isolate the military. In so doing, efforts must be made to avoid adverse socio-economic impacts on the people of Myanmar more generally. To that end, consultation on appropriate steps with civil society and the wider democratic movement, including the ‘National Unity Government’, representatives from ethnic and religious minorities, and trade unions, will be crucial., The Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise generates approximately 50 per cent of Myanmar’s foreign currency earnings. Additionally, the military has open access to foreign exchange held in overseas accounts of State-owned banks. As a result, the report calls on Member States to implement additional targeted measures against key entities that facilitate the Tatmadaw’s continued access to foreign currency., Furthermore, we urge all businesses active in Myanmar or sourcing from the country to take steps to ensure their operations do not economically benefit the military, including by conducting ongoing and transparent heightened human rights due diligence. Companies disinvesting or decoupling from supply chains in Myanmar should, of course, also take responsible measures to best protect the interests of their employees and consumers., These measures are fundamental to uphold business and human rights principles and to ensure that financial partnerships do not fuel human rights violations., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/interactive-dialogue-report-ohchr-progress-made-and-remaining-challenges-regard-recommendations-independent-intl-fact-finding-mission-myanmar-its-conference-room-paper-economic-interests-military

"Conditions for Untold Numbers of Innocent People in Myanmar Have Gone from Bad to Worse to Horrific, Special Rapporteur Tells Human Rights Council",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,21 Sep 2022,"Council Concludes General Debate on the Promotion and Protection of All Human Rights, Civil, Political, Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, including the Right to Development, Thomas Andrews, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, told the Human Rights Council this afternoon that conditions for untold numbers of innocent people in Myanmar had gone from bad to worse to horrific. Around 1.3 million people had been displaced; and the military had destroyed more than 28,000 homes, burning entire villages to the ground. The number of innocent people who had been killed or injured by landmines was rising significantly. There was a looming food crisis and a dramatic increase in childhood malnutrition; women were losing economic and social gains; and 130,000 Rohingya remained confined in de facto internment camps., Mr. Andrews said the people of Myanmar were frustrated and angered by Member States that were working to prop up this illegal and brutal military junta with funding, trade, weapons, and a veneer of legitimacy. They were also disappointed by those nations that voiced support for them, but then failed to back up their words with action. The international response to this deepening crisis had failed. Member States needed to take stronger, more effective action to deprive the junta and its forces of revenue, weapons and legitimacy. A coalition of nations needed to be established that could build a coordinated strategy on the crisis., Conflict was spreading throughout Myanmar, with more and more civilians taking up arms against the junta, said Mr. Andrews. Ethnic armed organizations were increasingly engaging junta forces. Clashes between the Arakan Army and junta forces were escalating. Newly formed People’s Defence Forces were now attacking the military throughout the country. The junta was deeply unpopular in every corner of Myanmar. The junta was using aid as a weapon by obstructing deliveries to displaced populations and communities that they perceived to be aligned with pro-democracy forces. Untold numbers of innocent people had been left without access to food, medicine and the means to survive., In the ensuing discussion, speakers said that for the past five years, the human rights situation in Myanmar had been catastrophic. The illegal coup of 2021 had plunged the country into a situation in which the entire population was held hostage by the military junta. Mass atrocities continued to be committed against the entire population. Full, safe, and unimpeded humanitarian access was essential for all persons in need. It was necessary to ensure the safety of humanitarian personnel, and to create the necessary conditions for a voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of refugees and internally displaced persons. The conflict also threatened peace and stability in the region, including India and in Bangladesh, where a durable solution had not been found to the Rohingya refugee crisis., One speaker said not listening to the State concerned ran counter to the Human Rights Council’s commitment to peaceful cooperation, and there should be understanding for the situation of Myanmar, and therefore the international community should seek means for cooperation. The unilateral coercive measures imposed on Myanmar should be lifted immediately. The Human Rights Council should cease to use politicised mandates against countries of the South, as they ran counter to the spirit of the United Nations Charter, and should tackle issues around the world in a cooperative and lasting manner., Speaking in the interactive dialogue were Luxembourg on behalf of a group of countries, European Union, Pakistan on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Sweden on behalf of a group of countries, Sierra Leone, Republic of Korea, France, Australia, India, Austria, and Venezuela., At the beginning of the meeting, the Council concluded its general debate on agenda item three on the promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development., Some speakers said that the protection and promotion of human rights was vital, and only when the right to development was guaranteed could there be guarantees of the other human rights. Economic, social and cultural rights were vital in the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which had pushed millions into poverty and unemployment, showing the weakened public system. The impact of this crisis and the environmental crisis had shown that this was a key moment in human history. Human rights had to be integrated in all recovery processes and plans, and the international human rights framework should be used in the progress towards a more harmonious international system in harmony with the environment, ensuring the survival of humanity., Speaking in the general debate were the following non-governmental organizations: Law Council of Australia on behalf of International Bar Association, Disability Association of Tavana, International Fellowship of Reconciliation, Soka Gakkai International on behalf of Instituto de Desenvolvimento e Direitos Humanos and International Organization for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Mouvement National des Jeunes Patriotes du Mali, China Society for Human Rights Studies (CSHRS), Instituto de Desenvolvimento e Direitos Humanos, YouChange China Social Entrepreneur Foundation, International Federation of Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture on behalf of Advocates for Human Rights and Ensemble contre la Peine de Mort, China Foundation for Human Rights Development, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, Centre Europe - tiers monde, Global Initiative for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, International Harm Reduction Association (IHRA), Friends World Committee for Consultation, Youth Parliament for SDG, Asociacion HazteOir.org, China Association for Preservation and Development of Tibetian Culture (CAPDTC), Make Mothers Matter, Edmund Rice International Limited, Shaanxi Patriotic Volunteer Association, Centre for Gender Justice and Women Empowerment, Physicians for Human Rights, Conscience and Peace Tax International (CPTI), and Association pour la défense des droits de l'homme et des revendications démocratiques/culturelles du peuple Azerbaidjanais-Iran - « ARC »., Also speaking were Mother of Hope Cameroon Common Initiative Group, Organization for Poverty Alleviation and Development, Global Institute for Water, Environment and Health, Associazione Comunita Papa Giovanni XXIII on behalf of a group of organisations, Meezaan Center for Human Rights, Interfaith International, Association Ma'onah for Human Rights and Immigration, Peace Track Initiative, Rencontre Africaine pour la defense des droits de l'homme, Association Internationale pour l'égalité des femmes, Tumuku Development and Cultural Union (TACUDU), Beijing Guangming Charity Foundation, Il Cenacolo, Global Welfare Association, United Nations Association of China, Partners For Transparency, Al-Ayn Social Care Foundation, Jubilee Campaign, Mouvement contre le racisme et pour l'amitié entre les peuples, Caritas Internationalis (International Confederation of Catholic Charities), Al Baraem Association for Charitable Work, Right Livelihood Award Foundation, Africa Culture Internationale, World Muslim Congress, Istituto Internazionale Maria Ausiliatrice delle Salesiane di Don Bosco, International Muslim Women's Union, Peace Brigades International, International Union of Socialist Youth, International Commission of Jurists, CIVICUS - World Alliance for Citizen Participation, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, Sikh Human Rights Group, Action Canada for Population and Development, International Humanist and Ethical Union, Medical Support Association for Underprivileged Iranian Patients, Association for Defending Victims of Terrorism, Beijing Changier Education Foundation, Promotion du Développement Economique et Social - PDES, Centre for Human Rights and Peace Advocacy, Organisation internationale pour les pays les moins avancés (OIPMA), International Action for Peace & Sustainable Development, Global Appreciation and Skills Training Network, and iuventum e.V.., Also taking the floor were African Green Foundation International, China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation, Coordination des Associations et des Particuliers pour la Liberté de Conscience, Alliance Defending Freedom on behalf of Associazione Comunita Papa Giovanni XXIII, Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain Inc, Iraqi Development Organization, Alsalam Foundation, Villages Unis (United Villages), Chunhui Children's Foundation, Maat for Peace, Development and Human Rights Association, International Human Rights Association of American Minorities (IHRAAM), United Towns Agency for North-South Cooperation, PRAHAR, Anglican Consultative Council, solidarité Suisse-Guinée, Association D'Entraide Médicale Guinée, Zero Pauvre Afrique, Synergie Feminine Pour La Paix Et Le Developpement Durable, Community Human Rights and Advocacy Centre (CHRAC), and Commission africaine des promoteurs de la santé et des droits de l'homme., Speaking in right of reply were the United States, Azerbaijan, China, Iran, and Armenia., The webcast of the Human Rights Council meetings can be found here.

Documents and reports related to the Human Rights Council’s fifty-first regular session can be found here., The Council will next meet at 10 a.m. on Thursday, 22 September, when it will conclude the interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar. This will be followed by an interactive dialogue on the report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on Myanmar., General Debate on Agenda Item Three on the Promotion and Protection of All Human Rights, Civil, Political, Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, including the Right to Development, The general debate on the promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, started in the previous meting and a summary can be found here., General Debate, In the debate, many speakers said that the protection and promotion of human rights was vital, and only when the right to development was guaranteed could there be guarantees of the other human rights. States should engage civil society and recognise lacunae in their protection of human rights, and take more seriously the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals by monitoring their impact on the ground., States had a major responsibility to create ripe conditions, at the international and national levels, to ensure the right to development, including combatting militarism and attacks on the international system. Unilateral coercive measures should not be used to implement iniquitous systems; there should be an inclusive international system based on the respect of human rights. Some Member States had not participated in the elaboration on a draft convention on the right to development, which was regretted, as it was essential for the implementation and guarantees of the right. The text should be progressive enough for the expectations for a text drafted in the modern period to be fulfilled., The staggering challenges facing the world required international efforts to review the economic integration of countries as a priority to ensure economic balance and development, as well as food security, which was still hanging in the balance. The challenges were fundamental, and were related to the right to development as well as the need to meet environmental challenges whilst ensuring sustainable development., Governments should respect and observe the independence of the judiciary, and ensure that proceedings were undertaken in an accountable and transparent manner. All States had obligations under international law on arms transfers, and should respect these rights, and the risk of arms being used against children should be assessed at sales., There was concern for the situation of elderly persons living in countries under international sanctions, as there was for persons with disabilities, who found access to resources and aid limited by the sanctions. All vulnerable people and groups should be protected to a greater extent, including from economic declines. Human rights education was vital for helping those in situations of danger and vulnerability. There should be a Special Rapporteur for unilateral coercive measures., Economic, social and cultural rights were vital in the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which had pushed millions into poverty and unemployment, showing the weakened public system. The impact of this crisis and the environmental crisis had shown that this was a key moment in human history. Human rights had to be integrated in all recovery processes and plans, and the international human rights framework should be used in the progress towards a more harmonious international system in harmony with the environment, ensuring the survival of humanity. Economic, social and cultural rights were basic rights, which covered many rights, including access to safe housing and drinking water, and the right to development was essential for achieving these rights., The pandemic had disproportionately affected youth, and the digital divide had excluded many from a digital education, particularly girls. The pandemic had taken a toll on the mental health of young people, leaving them unable to contribute to society. It had hindered youth volunteering. A Special Rapporteur on youth and an annual youth forum should be created to advance and mainstream youth rights, including the right to decent work. The Human Rights Council must play a driving role in ensuring the rights of young people., The right to freedom of expression was enshrined in many international instruments, however, around the world many organizations, including those of the media, did not hesitate to insult those who asserted this right, seeking to limit the rights and freedoms of those who asserted their rights through various means, including violent ones., The right to objection to military service was of concern, as there were still some States that did not recognise this right, forcing objectors to flee their own countries. The right deteriorated further in situations of armed conflict. Freedoms of thought, conscience and religion were non-derogable, and the work of the Council was vital for the protection of these rights, which were relevant to the right to conscientious objection to military service., Gender and sexual violence were used against human rights defenders, and to repress opponents in various areas of the world, and many journalists faced discrimination and harassment. Tough measures should be applied to those States violating the rights of journalists and media workers. Human rights defenders found their ability to act restricted, with a lack of security and access to justice, with direct repercussions on their ability to function effectively. Human rights defenders were vital for the protection of human rights, and should be protected, as without them, there could be no achievement of rights; State legislation restricting the scope of their activities must be erased., Other issues raised included that natural resources were being exploited, resulting in the economic deprivation of indigenous people, with concomitant effects on their health and extreme poverty. Further, a tragic reality faced migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees seeking safety in Europe, and there should be prompt, impartial and independent investigations into their deaths, as well as into the trafficking of migrants. Sexual minorities remained persecuted in many areas of the world, and they could suffer life imprisonment or even death, and the Council should examine these situations and ensure that the States involved respected the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex plus persons and groups, whilst punishing crimes committed against them. Illegal migration had a serious impact on indigenous rights, due to forced integration and assimilation, and caused great misery. The Human Rights Council should examine this issue in order to better safeguard the human rights of indigenous people. The Council should put pressure on militias to release all those in arbitrary detention., Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar, Presentation, THOMAS ANDREWS, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, said that conditions had gone from bad to worse to horrific for untold numbers of innocent people in Myanmar. Around 1.3 million people had been displaced; the military had destroyed more than 28,000 homes, burning entire villages to the ground. The number of innocent people who had been killed or injured by landmines was rising significantly. There was a looming food crisis and a dramatic increase in childhood malnutrition; women were losing economic and social gains; and 130,000 Rohingya remained confined in de facto internment camps., The people of Myanmar were frustrated and angered by Member States that were working to prop up this illegal and brutal military junta with funding, trade, weapons, and a veneer of legitimacy. They were also disappointed by those nations that voiced support for them, but then failed to back up their words with action. The Myanmar military was committing war crimes and crimes against humanity daily, including sexual violence, torture, deliberate targeting of civilians, and murder. The junta was holding at least 84 political prisoners on death row; and more than 12,000, including 295 children, remained arbitrarily detained in deplorable conditions, subject to torture., Conflict was spreading throughout the country, with more and more civilians taking up arms against the junta. Clashes between the Arakan Army and junta forces were escalating. Newly formed People’s Defence Forces were now attacking the military throughout the country. The junta was deeply unpopular in every corner of Myanmar. The junta was using aid as a weapon by obstructing deliveries to displaced populations and communities that they perceived to be aligned with pro-democracy forces. Untold numbers of innocent people had been left without access to food, medicine and the means to survive., The international response to this deepening crisis had failed. Member States needed to take stronger, more effective action to deprive the junta and its forces of revenue, weapons and legitimacy. A coalition of nations needed to be established that could build a coordinated strategy on the crisis. The amount of humanitarian aid that was available to address the crisis was grossly inadequate. More than 80 per cent of the United Nations Myanmar Humanitarian Response Plan remained unfunded. Local organizations needed strong support and flexibility from Member States and donors. The crisis was forcing many to flee Myanmar, embarking on perilous journeys across land and sea, and it was imperative that the Governments of host countries and the international community protected their human rights., Mr. Andrews said that he had spoken with more than 100 Myanmar human rights defenders, pro-democracy activists, aid workers, youth leaders, and women’s rights advocates. He had been deeply inspired by their courage and their tireless efforts to resist the illegal military junta. These people needed the world’s support. Many in Myanmar had come to the conclusion that the world had forgotten them, or simply did not care. The people of Myanmar desperately needed all Member States to re-think status quo policies that were clearly not working, and to stand with and for them as they fought for their lives, their children, and their future., Discussion, In the ensuing discussion, speakers said, among other things, that for the past five years, the human rights situation in Myanmar had been catastrophic. The illegal coup of 2021 had plunged the country into a situation in which the entire population was held hostage by the military junta. Mass atrocities continued to be committed against the entire population. Full, safe, and unimpeded humanitarian access was essential for all persons in need. It was necessary to ensure the safety of humanitarian personnel and to create the necessary conditions for a voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of refugees and internally displaced persons. All acts of violence against civilians must end, including sexual and gender-based violence, and violence against women, children, human rights defenders, religious minorities, journalists and media workers. All those arbitrarily detained must be released immediately and unconditionally. All United Nations Member States should end all supply, sale and transfer of arms to the Myanmar armed and security forces., Some speakers said that the conflict in Myanmar also threatened peace and stability in the region, including India and in Bangladesh, where a durable solution had not been found to the Rohingya refugee crisis. There should be meaningful accountability, justice, and a permanent solution to the crisis, with an immediate end to the violations against all inhabitants of Myanmar, including the Rohingya, who should have their citizenship restored, and should be repatriated to their country immediately and without delay, in full security. The complete human rights catastrophe continued, and there should be an immediate end to all mass killings, torture, including of children, and gender- and sexually-based violence. The military should restore the de facto moratorium on the death penalty, and release all political prisoners, including minors, whilst ensuring justice and reparation for victims. Further acts of violence against unarmed civilians should cease immediately, and the country should be allowed to return to democratic rule. The international community needed to take further steps to halt the deteriorating situation., A number of speakers said the efforts of the Association of South East Asian Nations and the United Nations Mission in Myanmar were applauded, as was the Bangladesh Government’s sustained efforts to provide for the needs of the Rohingya people it hosted. International efforts should continue to find a peaceful solution to the problem. The Special Rapporteur was commended for his work and his commitment to shedding light on the situation. The international community needed to remain committed to restoring peace and security to Myanmar. A peaceful solution involving all stakeholders was the only way forward towards resolving the humanitarian and national crisis., One speaker said that not listening to the State concerned ran counter to the Human Rights Council’s commitment to peaceful cooperation. The report was lopsided and contained allegations that were unverifiable. Politicised mandates did nothing to advance human rights, and should be rooted out of the work of the Human Rights Council. The unilateral coercive measures imposed on Myanmar should be lifted immediately. The Human Rights Council should cease to use politicised mandates against countries of the South, as they ran counter to the spirit of the United Nations Charter, and should tackle issues around the world in a cooperative and lasting manner.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/conditions-untold-numbers-innocent-people-myanmar-have-gone-bad-worse-horrific-special-rapporteur-tells-human-rights-council

Water Sanitation Hygiene",17 Aug 2022,"The political crisis in Myanmar started on 1 February 2021. By May 2021, political tensions and conflict had led to more than 114 000 people moving across the country -- many returning to their rural townships and villages for safety. Families were also preparing themselves for a food shortage: moving around in search of more jobs or resources, skipping meals or eating cheaper, less nutritious food, and even getting into debt to survive. Many rural families that absorbed the influx of urban migrants were themselves suffering and at risk of not having enough food for the growing population. The warning signs were clear. Urgent action was needed to mitigate the expected food security deterioration among returnees and host communities. The Anticipatory Action window of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations' (FAO's) Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA-AA) was activated thanks to the contribution of the German Federal Foreign Office. The goal was to ensure that the most vulnerable farming households would be able to plant during the monsoon season and maintain their dietary intake and income",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-mitigating-potential-food-crisis-rakhine-state-and-ayeyarwady-region-through-anticipatory-action

"9 children among 11 civilians killed in Myanmar military attacks in Shan State and Sagaing, 16 Sept",News and Press Release,AOAV,Protection and Human Rights,20 Sep 2022,"By Chiara Torelli on 20 Sep 2022, On 16 September 2022, Myanmar’s military killed 11 civilians and injured 30 in two incidents. Nine of the deceased are children, as are 14 of the injured., In Shan State’s Pekhon township, Myanmar’s military killed two men and two young girls aged seven and ten, and injured 13 others (including at least one woman and eight men), when they shelled a monastery being used as a shelter in Moebye. At least 300 internally displaced people were sheltering in Mwe Daw monastery at the time., Myanmar military troops have been shelling Moebye constantly since 11 September, when they were forced to retreat from the town., In Sagaing’s Tabayin township, seven children were killed and 14 injured, as well as three teachers, in an air strike on a monastic school in Let Yet Kone village. More children were killed in firearm attacks on the village following the air strike., Myanmar’s military has been fighting widespread resistance from established ethnic armed organisations (EAOs), civilian defence forces, and armed groups affiliated with the shadow National Unity Government since the coup in February 2021. In that time, indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure have been widely documented, in particular the use of explosive weapons in populated areas such as villages and places of worship., Since 2021, AOAV has recorded 363 incidents of explosive weapon use in Myanmar, which have resulted in 917 civilian casualties, including at least 84 women and 143 children., The majority of civilian casualties, 46%, as well as 62% of child casualties and 56% of women casualties, have occurred in villages. 20% of civilian casualties have occurred at public gatherings, and 10% in places of worship., Ground-launched weapons have caused the majority, 52%, of civilian casualties, in particular artillery shelling, non-specific shelling, grenade, mortars, and RPGs. Air-launched weapons are responsible for 21% of civilian casualties, specifically air strikes and air-dropped bombs. Non-specific IEDs have caused 9% of civilian casualties, mines have caused 7%, and rockets of unclear launched method <1%., Ground-launched weapons have also caused 65% of child casualties, and air-launched weapons 24%., State actors are the reported perpetrators of 75% of civilian casualties, and 90% of child casualties., AOAV’s casualty figures represent the lowest of estimations in terms of the number of people killed and injured by explosive weapon use. In an effort to quantify the explicit harm caused by specific explosive weapons, AOAV solely records incident-specific casualty figures, as reported in English-language media., AOAV condemns the use of violence against civilians and the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. All actors should stop using explosive weapons with wide-area effects where there is likely to be a high concentration of civilians.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/9-children-among-11-civilians-killed-myanmar-military-attacks-shan-state-and-sagaing-16-sept

Guidance note for cluster partners on collecting data on people with disabilities in the context of the Humanitarian Programme Cycle (HPC),Manual and Guideline,HI,Protection and Human Rights,15 Sep 2022,"Joint Document by – the Protection Cluster and Humanity & Inclusion (HI), Background:, The inter-census data 2019 shows that the disability prevalence rate in Myanmar is 12.8% with the most common type being difficulties in seeing (6.3%), followed by walking/climbing steps (5.4%), remembering/concentrating (4.4%), hearing (2.4%) and communication (1.6%). Persons with disabilities and those with mobility challenges face additional risks to their lives because they may not be able to protect themselves or find disability-friendly infrastructure, and access to protection or other essential services may be compromised. It becomes particularly difficult in times of conflict when they cannot quickly access safe places or leave an area under siege. In addition to difficulties when accessing services due to infrastructure, people with disabilities also often face attitudinal and institutional barriers, resulting in difficulties for their daily living and access to humanitarian assistance and protection. Furthermore, persons with disabilities may experience targeted violence and abuse because of their disability. Targeted violence against persons with disabilities may include physical attacks, killings, denial of food and medicine, harassment, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, profound neglect, shackling, and confinement., People with disabilities are likely to face specific risk and barriers and humanitarian settings. In addition to protection and assistance, they also require access to services response to their requirement, such as rehabilitation care, assistive devices, or nutrition support among others. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) recognizes persons with disabilities as “those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others” (Article 1)., “Disability” is a dynamic concept and not an attribute of the person: if a person with impairments in need access barrier-free and inclusive assistance and environment, his or her impairment might not lead to discrimination or exclusion. As such, people with disabilities require needs-based and inclusive services and necessary reasonable accommodations. This joint guidance note provides harmonized guidance on how humanitarian actors can promote inclusive humanitarian strategies and programs by enhancing the collecting use and analysis of quality disability data in the process of assessments and encourages all clusters to develop specific guidance on quality disaggregated disability data partners should collect in the process of monitoring and reporting activities., This, in turn, should help promote targeted assistance and/or mainstream disability in the humanitarian responses2 and help non-humanitarian actors to plan a sustained/integrated interventions as appropriate. Collection of data on people with disabilities also allows partners to facilitate the process of inter-agency work to promote inclusion and inclusive referrals that ensures people with disabilities are supported in safely accessing needed services.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/guidance-note-cluster-partners-collecting-data-people-disabilities-context-humanitarian-programme-cycle-hpc

Protection and Human Rights",16 Sep 2022,"GENEVA (16 September 2022) – UN experts said today human rights defenders documenting and responding to atrocities by Myanmar's military junta urgently need comprehensive support, including financial, and called on the international community to end apparent indifference to the violence targeting the country's population., “In the face of inaction by the international community, and with human rights violations continuing to be perpetrated on a daily basis by the military junta, human rights defenders are persisting in their support for those targeted and working to preserve the possibility of justice in the future,” said Mary Lawlor, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders., Along with Tom Andrews, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Lawlor highlighted the grave risks defenders face and the specific challenges confronting women human rights defenders., “Defenders have been murdered and disappeared by the military since the coup took place. They now risk arrest, detention, torture, including sexual violence and death when going about their work and fear having their documents seized at military checkpoints,” the experts said. “Many have had to go into hiding after being targeted by the military for assisting survivors of gender-based violence. They are on the move constantly, and women human rights defenders often have no choice but to take their children with them when they flee.”, Others have had to relocate to neighbouring countries, where they remain vulnerable., Lawlor and Andrews said they had publicly expressed concerns for the safety of defenders in the country just over a year ago., “What's needed is concrete support for Myanmar human rights defenders, including those who have had to flee the country: stronger, coordinated pressure on the junta, timely and responsive direct financial support for defenders on the ground, and visas or resettlement for those fleeing the country,” the experts said., “The international community must not adopt a passive stance when it comes to the crimes that are being perpetrated by the military junta and the risks for human rights defenders in Myanmar.”, The experts: Ms Mary Lawlor (Ireland) is the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders.

UN report calls for urgent action to halt access to revenue and arms supplies by Myanmar military,News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Humanitarian Financing
Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",16 Sep 2022,"GENEVA (16 September 2022) – States must do more to cut the Myanmar military’s access to revenue and arms supplies to halt its repression of the people, a report released today by the UN Human Rights Office said., The report was requested by the Human Rights Council to follow up on earlier recommendations made by the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (‘FFM’) on economic interests of the Myanmar military (the Tatmadaw)., Today’s report reiterates the FFM’s recommendations to impose targeted financial sanctions on the Tatmadaw and its economic interests as well as arms embargos, while at the same time highlighting that such measures must respect human rights and that efforts must be made to mitigate foreseeable socio-economic impacts. Several States continue to supply weaponry and engage in military cooperation, it states., Since seizing control of State organs, the so-called State Administration Council has “failed to govern in meaningful and sustainable ways, instead continuing to repress and terrorize the Myanmar people,” the report says., While some progress has been made on the FFM’s recommendations to economically isolate the Tatmadaw, there remain significant gaps, which are ever more important following the coup. Targeted measures should particularly focus on the military’s foreign currency access, said the report., It urges the international community to step up efforts to support the people of Myanmar and to ensure the military’s financial isolation in a coordinated fashion. Appropriate sanctions should be implemented in consultation with civil society and the democratic movement, including trade unions and the National Unity Government, to calibrate their impact., Myanmar’s military authorities are clearly prioritizing its military campaigns over the welfare of the population and economic recovery, the report said. In comparison with the previous annual Government budget, the military authorities’ 2022/23 budget increased defence spending, while reducing allocations to education, health, and social welfare., Poverty in Myanmar has increased at least two-fold and the public health system has effectively broken down since the coup, and more than half of all school-age children have not had access to education for two academic years, the report said., It also reported that some States and companies continue business relationships with military-owned enterprises in a number of sectors., All businesses active in Myanmar or sourcing from the country should take steps to ensure they do not economically benefit the military, including by conducting ongoing and transparent heightened human rights due diligence, the report says., For more information and media requests, please contact:

Introduction and methodology, In resolution A/HRC/RES/46/21, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (‘OHCHR’) to provide the Council at its fiftyfirst session a comprehensive report on progress made and challenges remaining with regard to recommendations made by the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (‘FFM’) in its 2019 conference room paper on the economic interests of the Myanmar military (‘Tatmadaw’), and to provide further recommendations.1, In its paper, the FFM determined that the ability of the military and its leadership to draw on various sources of revenue enabled its conduct, including perpetration of serious international crimes. The FFM investigated five areas of the military’s economic interests, came to conclusions, and listed implicated individuals and companies in separate annexes. Its recommendations were targeted at seven groups of actors. Updates and responses to the original paper are publicly available.2, This report assesses actions taken by various actors following release of the FFM’s paper until 31 July 2022, identifies continuing and emerging challenges, and uses examples to highlight relevant issues., This report was prepared using open-source material collected and subjected to credibility assessments, including Myanmar Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (‘EITI’) databases, corporate records, public reports containing first-hand information from credible and reliable sources, and satellite imagery and analysis. In addition to an open call for submissions,3 all named entities (26 States, 41 companies, and 11 institutions) were contacted to the extent possible during the drafting process. All 42 submissions received were duly considered. Remote interviews were also conducted with subject matter experts, civil society actors and journalists. Notes from these confidential meetings are on file. Given the grave security risks that individuals in Myanmar face since the military launched its coup,4 OHCHR prioritized the safety of all interlocutors above other considerations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/progress-made-and-remaining-challenges-regard-recommendations-independent-international-factfinding-mission-myanmar-ahrc5141-advance-unedited-version

As of 6 September 2022, there were an estimated 1,312,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) across the country, including 982,000 people who have been newly displaced within the country since 1 February 2021., In the South-East, indiscriminate shelling, armed clashes and landmines continued to affect civilians. Security checks, curfews, roadblocks and arbitrary arrests have also negatively impacted people’s freedom of movement. Displaced families remain particularly vulnerable and exposed to numerous risks due to a shortage of appropriate shelter. A lack of food and essential medicines are concerns in Kayah and Kayin States and Bago (East) Region. Despite ongoing response efforts, access constraints have seriously hampered humanitarian interventions., In Rakhine State (Central) and Chin State (South), rising tensions and armed clashes caused new displacement. Internally displaced families in Paletwa, Chin State, are in urgent need of assistance although efforts are ongoing to ascertain displacement in all areas affected by conflict. Increased arrests and checkpoints on roads and waterways have been reported and are impacting communities’ security and freedom of movement. Tighter restrictions on the transportation of goods and freedom of movement have also been noted in villages in Maungdaw, Rakhine State (North), which face a shortage of food, medicines and other essential items., In the North-West, the situation is increasingly volatile. Active armed clashes and security operations in various townships in Sagaing and Magway Regions continue to trigger displacement with most displaced communities living in informal displacement sites. Increased checkpoints have also been reported. With the price of fuel and other commodities rising, many are at risk of becoming more isolated due to access challenges., In Kachin and Shan (North), tensions were high in many townships due to armed clashes. In urban areas such as Hpakant and Myitkyina, explosive devices featured heavily in armed conflict incidents. Drug trade, robberies, thefts and burglaries are also reportedly on the rise in urban areas.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-emergency-update-6-september-2022

This week, 490 IDPs from seven village tracts were verified in the township., In Mon State’s Kyaikhto Township, increased military presence led to the displacement of 1,200 individuals to villages and monasteries., In Shan State (South)’s Pekon Township, 780 newly verified IDPs were recorded following heavy fighting in Moe Bye town between 8 and 10 September. Increased presence of security forces in July 2022 also resulted in secondary displacement of some 320 IDPs towards Kayah State’s Loikaw Township which were only verified this week.

"Atrocity Alert No. 317: Myanmar (Burma), Ukraine and Afghanistan",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,14 Sep 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., DEADLY ARMED CONFLICT RETURNS TO MYANMAR’S RAKHINE STATE, Following weeks of escalating conflict in Rakhine State and southern Chin State, a ceasefire that has been in place between Myanmar’s (Burma) military — the Tatmadaw — and the ethnic armed organization the Arakan Army (AA) since November 2020 appears to have entirely broken down. The temporary ceasefire was established following two years of war between the Tatmadaw and AA – an armed group seeking greater autonomy for the ethnic Rakhine Buddhist population in Rakhine State. Since June, tensions between the Tatmadaw and AA have steadily risen, with reports of intense fighting, shelling and deployment of troops since early August., Most of the fighting has been concentrated in Maungdaw, Rathedaung, Buthidaung and Mrauk-U townships in Rakhine State, as well as in Paletwa township in southern Chin State. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, as of 5 September the violence had displaced nearly 9,600 people, bringing the total number displaced by past and ongoing fighting between the Tatmadaw and AA to almost 84,000. Key roads and waterways have been blocked, restricting freedom of movement and halting humanitarian assistance from reaching people in need., Escalating armed conflict in Rakhine State comes as populations across the country continue to face atrocity risks resulting from the February 2021 coup. On 12 September Nicholas Koumjian, Head of the UN Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM), presented the IIMM’s fourth annual report on Myanmar during the 51st session of the Human Rights Council. Between 16 June 2021 to 30 June 2022 the IIMM found that “the scope of potential international crimes taking place in Myanmar has broadened dramatically,” with evidence indicating that the military continues to commit war crimes, as well as the crimes against humanity of murder, torture, deportation and forcible transfer, rape and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and imprisonment., Renewed fighting between the Tatmadaw and AA not only increases the risk of atrocities facing civilians but also complicates the prospects for the safe, dignified and voluntary repatriation of Rohingya refugees from Bangladesh to Myanmar. Liam Scott, Myanmar Expert at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said, “the resurgence of violence between the Arakan Army and the Tatmadaw underscores the international community’s ongoing failure to effectively respond to the post-coup crisis in Myanmar. Imposing arms embargoes and sanctions against the oil and gas sectors are the least individual states and the UN Security Council should do to uphold their Responsibility to Protect.”, UKRAINIAN OFFENSIVE GAINS GROUND AS CIVILIAN CASUALTY FIGURES NEAR 14,000, Since the beginning of September, Ukrainian forces have engaged in a renewed offensive, retaking thousands of square miles of territory in their country’s south and northeast. The most significant gains have been made around the city of Kharkiv, where retreating Russian forces have intensified targeted attacks against civilian infrastructure, including on power plants providing heat and electricity to civilians in the region and beyond. Fighting also continues along front lines in Donbas, with the UN reporting at least 50 civilian casualties between 2-4 September in the Donetsk region., As Russian forces retreat from previously occupied areas, international human rights groups have urged Ukrainian authorities to prioritize the documentation of evidence of possible atrocities, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. Any evidence found would add to the over 26,000 war crimes investigations currently underway by Ukrainian authorities. Throughout the conflict, Russian forces and Russian-backed armed groups have perpetrated myriad abuses, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, rape and sexual violence, and the use of cluster munitions. The UN has also documented reports of the use of cluster munitions in populated areas by Ukrainian forces., International human rights groups have also accused Russian forces of the forcible transfer of civilians from Ukraine. A recent report by Human Rights Watch documented accounts of forcible transfers to Russia, with some civilians interned for security processing. The forcible transfer of civilians is a serious violation of international humanitarian and human rights law. Human Rights Watch concluded that the circumstances may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. During a UN Security Council meeting on the situation in Ukraine on 7 September, Under Secretary-General Rosemary DiCarlo, stressed that, “the persistent allegations of forced displacement, deportation and so-called “filtration camps” run by the Russian Federation and affiliated local forces are extremely disturbing.”, As the war in Ukraine continues in the south and northeast, civilians continue to bear the brunt of fighting. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has created one of the world’s largest refugee crises. Although millions of people have returned to Ukraine, thousands continue to be newly displaced along the front lines, including approximately 60,000 people evacuated in August alone. Since 24 February the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has confirmed almost 14,000 civilian casualties, including 5,827 killed, though it asserts that the figure is likely much higher., All parties to the conflict must ensure the protection of civilians in areas impacted by ongoing fighting. All violations of international law must be investigated and the perpetrators held accountable, regardless of rank or affiliation., UN SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR WARNS OF LIKELY CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN AFGHANISTAN, During the 51st session of the UN Human Rights Council, on 12 September the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, presented his first report since the establishment of his mandate. Notably, the report concluded that attacks against ethnic and religious minorities in Afghanistan bear “the hallmarks of crimes against humanity” as they “appear to be systematic in nature and reflect elements of an organizational policy.” Many of these attacks were perpetrated by the so-called the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K) and directly targeted ethnic and religious minorities, including Hazara Shias, other Shia Muslims, Sufi Muslims, Sikhs and others. While presenting the report, Special Rapporteur Bennett noted that ISIL-K has “systematically” attacked places of worship, education and other civilian areas., Targeted attacks against ethno-religious minorities have regularly occurred in Afghanistan since the Taliban took over the country more than a year ago. On 2 September a suicide bomb attack occurred at Guzargah Mosque in Herat, western Afghanistan, killing 18 and wounding 23 others. This attack follows a series of mass casualty events that occurred throughout August, killing and injuring more than 250 Afghans. Many of these attacks were perpetrated by ISIL-K., According to a recent report from the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan’s Human Rights Service, 700 civilians were killed and 1,406 wounded from 15 August 2021 to 15 June 2022. Members of ethnic and religious minorities have also been arbitrarily arrested, tortured, summarily executed and in some cases forced to flee the country. Special Rapporteur Bennett underscored that, “the human rights situation was concerning for decades prior to the Taliban seizing control of the country in August 2021; since then, it has significantly deteriorated.”, The Taliban de facto authorities have taken minimal steps to prevent or halt these crimes and meaningfully protect minority communities. According to Human Rights Watch, targeted attacks often go unreported as a result of the Taliban’s increasing crackdown on independent media. Special Rapporteur Bennett emphasized in his report that Taliban de facto authorities have a “responsibility as duty bearers to protect all Afghans against threats to life and security,” including through safeguarding schools, places of worship and other locations frequented by ethno-religious minorities., The Taliban de facto authorities must heed all of the recommendations by the Special Rapporteur, including their responsibility to protect all Afghans equally. The Taliban should also allow the assistance of the international community in meeting these obligations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-317-myanmar-burma-ukraine-and-afghanistan

Since February 2021, the RTG estimates that some 22,000 Myanmar refugees have sought temporary safety in Thailand., Refugees are sheltered in temporary safety areas (TSA), which are placed under the general jurisdiction of the Royal Thai Army by the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) established by the RTG in March 2021, SITUATION OVERVIEW ON THE THAI MYANMAR BORDER – AUGUST 2022, In Kayah State, armed clashes continued around Demoso and Loikaw since the Military scaled up its troops' deployment in early August in an attempt to regain control of these areas. In Kayin State, clashes in Kawkareik Township have been reported between the Tatmadaw and Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). Throughout August, daily battles reportedly took place between the Tatmadaw and the KNLA-led opposition forces – in the Karen National Union (KNU)-controlled areas of Dooplaya District (i.e., Brigade 6 controlled area), which is opposite Mae Sot, Phop Phra, and Umphang districts of Tak. The escalation of conflict around Myawaddy Township in late July and early August triggered displacement across the border into Thailand. On 29 July, the RTG reported new arrivals into Thailand caused by the resurgence of fighting in Myawaddy Town. The authorities recorded 244 individuals who sought safety in Thailand and were sheltered in one Temporary Safety Area (TSA) in Mor Ker Thai Temple, Valley sub-district, Pob Pra district, Tak province. All refugees reportedly returned to Myanmar once fighting subsided, and the TSA was officially closed on 13 August. In the Tanintharyi region, fighting intensified between the People Defense Force (PDF) and the Military in August, especially around Dawei Township., As of 29 August, the total number of internally displaced people (IDPs) in Myanmar displaced since 1 February is 974,400, of whom 283,800 are in the southeast provinces – Kayah, Shan, Kayin, Mon States, and Tanintharyi and Bago regions. Most of the newly displaced were in Kayin State, where 1,100 people sought safety in the jungle in Thandaungyyi Township due to airstrikes. The number of IDPs continued to increase in Tanintharyi Region due to general insecurity. Local media reported that 700 people were displaced to the jungle nearby. In Kayah State, about 210 IDPs in Nyaung Shwe Township were able to return to Loikaw.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-inter-agency-update-6-september-2022
"Statement to the Human Rights Council by Nicholas Koumjian, Head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, on the 51st Regular Session of the Human Rights Council",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,12 Sep 2022,"Mister President,, Excellencies,, I am honoured to appear before you to present the fourth Annual Report of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar. We were created by this Council to collect and preserve evidence of the most serious international crimes in Myanmar. Tragically, I must report that since I last addressed you, such crimes have intensified. The people of Myanmar continue to suffer because of the lack of accountability for those who believe they answer to no law., Five years have now passed since the 2017 military clearance operations in Rakhine State led most of the Rohingya population to flee Myanmar. Almost all remain in neighbouring countries awaiting the day when conditions will allow their safe and dignified return home. The end of impunity for those who inflicted the violence would do much to create such conditions., Since the military coup in February last year, there is increasing evidence of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murder, torture, deportation and forcible transfer, persecution, imprisonment, and targeting of the civilian population., The Mechanism prioritizes gathering evidence of sexual and gender-based violence and crimes against children. Women and children are at particular risk in conflicts, yet experience shows that crimes against them are typically under-reported and under-prosecuted. We have gathered reports of children in Myanmar having been tortured and arbitrarily detained, sometimes to target their parents. There is also increasing evidence of sexual and gender-based crimes against both women and men., While capital punishment is not itself an international crime, imposing a death sentence on the basis of proceedings that do not satisfy the basic requirements of a fair trial can amount to a crime against humanity. There are strong indications that the executions of four individuals in July were without due process, as proceedings lacked transparency and virtually no information is available as to the charges and evidence., Mister President,, The Mechanism faces many challenges collecting evidence, given that we are denied access to crime scenes and witnesses in Myanmar. To date, we have made a dozen requests for permission to enter the country and for information relevant to allegations of international crimes. No response has yet been received., Despite these challenges, there is notable progress. Many brave individuals, NGOs and other entities have shared valuable evidence with us. We have conducted numerous screenings and interviews from persons who have provided vital first-hand information about crimes perpetrated inside the country. Ensuring protection and support for those who provide us with information is an issue of increasing concern., The Mechanism has prepared 67 evidential and analytical packages to share with judicial authorities, including for proceedings at the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice. Our staff now includes expertise in open source and financial investigations, boosting our analytical capacity., Our Annual Report noted that we had collected and processed almost three million information items from more than 200 sources, including interview statements, documentation, videos, photographs, geospatial imagery, and social media material – more than double what we reported last year. Since the Report was drafted, this number of items has more than doubled again., We now face the challenging task of analysing the material collected. For example, Facebook has shared with the Mechanism millions of items from networks of accounts that were taken down by the company because they misrepresented their identity – the accounts were actually controlled by the Myanmar military. Our team has identified posts inciting fear and hatred of Rohingya that appeared on these military-controlled networks. For example, one post appeared on ten different pages within one such network on 10 August 2017 just before the clearance operations began. It contained false reports of Rohingya arming en masse and threatening Myanmar’s Buddhists, and a photo of a cow with its stomach slit and disembowelled – an image offensive to Myanmar Buddhists., Mister President,, I am sincerely grateful for the support of this Council and call on all states committed to ending the worst violence in Myanmar to support our work. Perpetrators of the most serious international crimes committed in Myanmar must know that we are united in our efforts to break the cycle of impunity and to ensure that those responsible for such crimes will face justice., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/statement-human-rights-council-nicholas-koumjian-head-independent-investigative-mechanism-myanmar-51st-regular-session-human-rights-council
Human Rights Council Discusses Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar and in Sri Lanka,News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",12 Sep 2022,"MIDDAY, The Human Rights Council this morning held an interactive dialogue with Nicholas Koumjian, Head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar, followed by an interactive dialogue with Nada Al-Nashif, Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights, on the situation of human rights in Sri Lanka., Nicholas Koumjian, Head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, said crimes in Myanmar had intensified. The people of Myanmar continued to suffer because of the lack of accountability for those who believed they answered to no law. There was increasing evidence of crimes against humanity and war crimes. Women and children were at particular risk in conflicts, yet experience showed that crimes against them were typically under-reported and under-prosecuted. The Mechanism was united in its efforts to break the cycle of impunity and to ensure that those responsible for crimes would face justice., In the discussion on Myanmar, some speakers welcomed the report and strongly condemned the human rights abuses and violations in Myanmar. Reports on systematic and sexual-based violence and crimes affecting children were appalling. The human rights situation in Myanmar had deteriorated, in particular for those who were part of religious or ethnic minorities. The military should end the attacks on civilians and allow the population to express its human rights, including the right to freedom of expression. Other speakers pointed out that political mandates did not foster an environment of protection and promotion of human rights. Political dialogue was the only way to resolve the situation in the country., Nada Al-Nashif, Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights, presenting a report on the situation of human rights in Sri Lanka, said since the previous update in March 2022, the country had been suffering from an unprecedented economic crisis. Months of countrywide protests eventually led to the President’s resignation and a new President was elected by the Sri Lankan Parliament on 20 July 2022. Ms. Al- Nashif encouraged the new Government to embark on a national dialogue to advance human rights and reconciliation and to carry out the deeper institutional, reforms needed to combat impunity and to tackle the economic crisis., Ms. Al-Nashif said 13 years since the end of war in Sri Lanka, tens of thousands of survivors and their families continued to seek justice and to know the whereabouts of their loved ones, with Sri Lanka repeatedly failing to pursue transitional justice. Instead, successive governments had created political obstacles to accountability, and actively promoted some officials credibly implicated in alleged war crimes, into the highest levels of government. The Acting High Commissioner called on States to pursue alternate strategies to advance accountability at the international level, including through the consideration of targeted sanctions against alleged perpetrators, as well as cooperation to initiate prosecutions based on extraterritorial jurisdiction., Ali Sabry, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka, speaking as a country concerned, said the Government was extremely sensitive to the socio-economic hardships faced by its people, and had initiated immediate measures to address challenges and to ensure their wellbeing. Discussions on debt restructuring were in progress. The Government was in dialogue with United Nations agencies as well as bilateral partners to protect the most vulnerable from the adverse impacts of the crisis. Sri Lanka would endeavour to meet the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The State looked forward to constructive engagement with the Council through the Universal Periodic Review process. Sri Lanka along with several Member States of this Council had opposed resolution 46/1, fundamentally disagreeing with its legitimacy and objectives., In the discussion on Sri Lanka, some speakers welcomed the formation of a more inclusive Sri-Lankan Government and constitutional reform. The peaceful transition of power and the efforts taken to restore peace and stability were applauded. Some speakers were concerned about the current situation in Sri Lanka, which was characterised by an economic crisis and violations of fundamental human rights. There were high levels of concern around freedom of expression, as peaceful protests resulting from the crisis situation were met with violence. Sri Lankan authorities were urged to protect the freedom of expression and assembly for all, and to stop arbitrary arrests of those engaging in peaceful protests. Some speakers reiterated their position to reject country-specific initiatives and resolutions that were confrontational and did not have the consent of the country concerned. For these speakers, it was important to provide technical assistance to Sri Lanka and strengthen its national institutions. Some speakers maintained that the mandate was costly, with no effect on the situation, and did not support solidarity., Also speaking in the morning meeting was Alfonso Nsue Mokuy, Third Deputy Prime Minister in charge of human rights of Equatorial Guinea, who said that the effects of the international economic crisis and the health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic had constituted a challenge for the effective exercise of human rights in general, in particular economic, social and cultural rights. Each country had its own values, legislation and social demands, but it was also vital for all to reach basic agreements to foster respect and non-discrimination, and combat violence in all spheres. The Government of Equatorial Guinea had worked tirelessly to combat the pandemic, making it possible to reduce incidents of mortality in the country, with significant economic resources provided by the Government. The Government had also worked to eliminate corruption, and had carried out positive activities in this context., Speaking in the discussion on Myanmar were Finland, on behalf of Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden; European Union; Pakistan, on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation; Switzerland; Egypt; France; Luxembourg; Netherlands; Australia; Ireland; Japan; Venezuela; China; Malaysia; United States; United Kingdom; Indonesia; Bangladesh; Timor-Leste; Romania; Belgium; The Gambia; New Zealand; Italy; Iran; Türkiye; Malawi; Canada; and Armenia., Also speaking were the following civil society representatives: Centre for Civil and Political Rights; Jubilee Campaign; International Commission of Jurists; International Federation for Human Rights Leagues; Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development; Meezaan Centre for Human Rights; iuventum e.V.; Lawyers' Rights Watch Canada; and the International Organization for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination., Speaking in the discussion on Sri Lanka were the Netherlands on behalf of the three countries of the Benelux; Finland on behalf of the Nordic-Baltic countries; European Union; Saudi Arabia on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council; Liechtenstein; Switzerland; Egypt; India; France; Democratic People’s Republic of Korea; North Macedonia; Australia; Ireland; Japan; Maldives; Ethiopia; Cuba; Kazakhstan; Venezuela; Viet Nam; Russian Federation; China; Nigeria; Syrian Arab Republic; Nicaragua; United States; Nepal; United Kingdom; Bangladesh; Pakistan; South Sudan; Burundi; Zimbabwe; Yemen; Lao People’s Democratic Republic; Montenegro; Azerbaijan; Cameroon; Canada; New Zealand; Thailand; Uganda; Philippines, Kenya; Iran; Türkiye; Bolivia; Lebanon; Sudan; Cambodia; Eritrea; and Niger., The following civil society organizations also spoke: Khiam Rehabilitation Centre for Victims of Torture; Christian Solidarity Worldwide; Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development; Baptist World Alliance; World Evangelical Alliance on behalf of Alliance Defending Freedom; Centre for Civil and Political Rights; Franciscans International; People for Equality and Relief in Lanka Inc-; International Commission of Jurists; and Global Life Savers Inc., The webcast of the Human Rights Council meetings can be found here. All meeting summaries can be found here. Documents and reports related to the Human Rights Council’s fifty-first regular session can be found here., The next meeting of the Human Rights Council will start at 1:45 p.m. to hold an interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, followed by an enhanced interactive dialogue on Afghanistan., Interactive Dialogue with the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, Report, The Council has before it the report of the Independent Investigative Mission for Myanmar (A/HRC/51/4), Presentation of the Report, NICHOLAS KOUMJIAN, Head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, said crimes in Myanmar had intensified. The people of Myanmar continued to suffer because of the lack of accountability for those who believed they answered to no law. Five years had passed since the 2017 military clearance operations in Rakhine state led most of the Rohingya population to flee Myanmar. Almost all remained in neighbouring countries awaiting the day when conditions would allow their safe and dignified return home. There was increasing evidence of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murder, torture, deportation, and forcible transfer and persecution. The Mechanism prioritised gathering evidence of sexual and gender-based violence and crimes against children. Women and children were at particular risk in conflicts, yet experience showed that crimes against them were typically under-reported and under-prosecuted. Children in Myanmar were tortured and arbitrarily detained, sometimes to target their parents., There were strong indications that the executions of four individuals in July were without due process. The Mechanism faced many challenges collecting evidence, being denied access to crime scenes and witnesses in Myanmar. The Mechanism had obtained millions of items from networks of Facebook accounts controlled by the Myanmar military that were taken down by the company because they misrepresented their identity. Posts from these military accounts incited fear and hatred of Rohingya. The Mechanism was united in its efforts to break the cycle of impunity and to ensure that those responsible for crimes would face justice., Discussion, Some speakers strongly condemned the human rights abuses and violations in Myanmar, which amounted to systematic crimes against humanity. The reported systematic and sexual-based violence and crimes affecting children were appalling. The human rights situation in Myanmar had deteriorated, in particular for those who were part of religious or ethnic minorities. Perpetrators must be held accountable. All partners of the international community should cooperate fully with the Mechanism so that victims could get justice. Some speakers strongly condemned the military coup. Human rights violations had been committed in a manner that was a widespread and coordinated attack on the civilian population, to an extent which could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. The executions of pro-democracy individuals were condemned. The military should end the attacks on civilians and allow the population to express its human rights, including the right to freedom of expression., The Mechanism should continue to collect and preserve information about the situation, some speakers said. Myanmar’s persistent non-cooperation with the Mechanism was deplored: it should fully cooperate with the view to delivering justice, including and in particular to the Rohingyas. All social media platforms should share information with the Mechanism as and when they were approached, and the Mechanism should ensure that principles of “do no harm” were at the centre of their outreach in this context. The security forces and armed groups should ensure the protection of civilians, and reinstate immediately the moratorium on the death penalty. There should be a political resolution to the situation, ensuring that those culpable were brought to justice. There were serious international crimes and violations of international humanitarian law. The continuation of the tragic situation of the Rohingya was deplored, and they should be protected, with a lasting solution found to the crisis. The Office of the High Commissioner should communicate and cooperate with the Special Envoy to Myanmar. Bangladesh’s efforts to deal with the Rohingya crisis were applauded, and the international community was urged to cooperate in all ways with its efforts., Some speakers said politically-mandated mandates did not foster an environment of protection and promotion of human rights. The Universal Periodic Review was the suitable mechanism for addressing the human rights situation of countries around the world, not the unilateral imposition of mechanisms that only undermined the work of the Council. Political dialogue was the only way to resolve the situation in Myanmar, with the support of peace-loving nations, and this was the only way that Myanmar could overcome its existing challenges. It was regretted that Myanmar could not attend the dialogue, and the work done to boost its economy was recognised. There should be a political solution to the situation, in order to restore the dialogue within the country. The international community should speak in one voice that could further help all parties to further bridge differences, instead of creating tension and causing the situation to deteriorate further. The international community should also actively promote dialogue within Myanmar in order to restore peace and truly protect and promote human rights., Concluding Remarks, NICHOLAS KOUMJIAN, Head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, said that under international law, the lack of due process could amount to an international crime. The Mechanism was interested in gathering evidence on the fairness of legal proceedings. No response had been received from the authorities in Myanmar. A key challenge was reaching those who had evidence, and achieving this required cooperation from States in the region. The Mechanism had conducted voluntary interactions, and needed the support of States to operate on territories hosting witnesses of human rights abuses. The Mechanism did not have the resources to provide all of the psychosocial and medical support that victims and witnesses needed, and requested the support of States in this regard. The Mechanism was committed to providing judges of a case dealing with genocide with the best evidence. The time that the Mechanism had to share evidence with courts was limited, and so it was redoubling efforts to collect evidence within the required timeframe., Statement by the Third Vice Prime Minister in Charge of Human Rights of Equatorial Guinea, ALFONSO NSUE MOKUY, Third Vice Prime Minister in Charge of Human Rights of Equatorial Guinea, said the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner had moved forward and promoted many projects to protect, guarantee and defend human rights. The effects of the international economic crisis and the health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic had constituted a challenge for the effective exercise of human rights in general, in particular economic, social and cultural rights. Each country had its own values, legislation and social demands, but it was also vital for all to reach basic agreements to foster respect and non-discrimination, and combat violence in all spheres. The work fostered by the Office of the High Commissioner aimed at improving the human rights situation was commended, particularly with regard to the Sustainable Development Goals., The Government of Equatorial Guinea had decided to change the track of the National 2020 Horizon Plan, with the support of development partners, mainstreaming the Sustainable Development Goals and the Agenda 2030, and the Agenda 2063 in its planning schemes, which enshrined a global vision of Equatorial Guinea and its role at the international level, including its commitment to strong economic growth, making it possible to improve living standards, eradicate poverty, protect the environment, and make it a country where all could live. The new Criminal Code had already been approved by the Head of State. The Government had worked tirelessly to combat the pandemic, making it possible to reduce incidents of mortality in the country, with significant economic resources provided by the Government., After the pandemic, the lack of public security had been the second concern facing the inhabitants of the country, due to the threat of juvenile crime. Thanks to the clean-up operation run by the Government, there had been a positive impact and the usual serenity had returned to the society. The Government had also worked to eliminate corruption, and had carried out positive activities in this context., Interactive Dialogue on the Report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on Sri Lanka, Report, The Council has before it the report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Sri Lanka (A/HRC/51/5), Presentation of Report, NADA AL-NASHIF, Acting United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, presenting the Office’s report on the human rights situation in Sri Lanka, said that since the previous update in March 2022, the country had been suffering from an unprecedented economic crisis. Inflation was at a shocking 66.7 per cent and Sri Lankans had been facing severe shortages of fuel, electricity, food, medicines, and other essential items, while 6.3 million people were estimated to be food insecure., Months of countrywide protests eventually led to the President’s resignation and a new President was elected by the Sri Lankan Parliament on 20 July 2022. Ms. Al- Nashif encouraged the new Government to embark on a national dialogue to advance human rights and reconciliation and to carry out the deeper institutional reforms needed to combat impunity and to tackle the economic crisis. Concerningly in recent weeks, leaders and members of the protest movement and trade unions had been arrested. Ms. Al-Nashif urged the Government to take positive action to foster an environment for peaceful protest. She welcomed the tone set by the President in his first speech in parliament where he promised constitutional reforms., Thirteen years since the end of war, tens of thousands of survivors and their families continued to seek justice and to know the whereabouts of their loved ones, with the State repeatedly failing to pursue transitional justice. Instead, successive governments had created political obstacles to accountability, and actively promoted some officials credibly implicated in alleged war crimes, into the highest levels of government. The High Commissioner called on States to pursue alternate strategies to advance accountability at the international level, including through the consideration of targeted sanctions against alleged perpetrators, as well as cooperation to initiate prosecutions based on extraterritorial jurisdiction. The team established in the High Commissioner’s Office had made progress, including through conducting proactive analytical work, including in relation to gender and child-related violations, and was consolidating evidence collected by the United Nations into a repository, which would assist future accountability initiatives. The scale of this work required time and financial resources supported by States, and Ms. Al- Nashif urged the Council to ensure this work was supported., Impunity remained a central obstacle to Sri Lanka’s sustainable peace and development, and risked enabling further violations. The mandate granted by the Council to continue monitoring the human rights situation and pursue accountability for crimes under international law was now more important than ever., Response by Country Concerned, ALI SABRY, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka, speaking as the country concerned, said that the Government was extremely sensitive to the socio-economic hardships faced by its people, and had initiated immediate measures to address challenges and to ensure the wellbeing of its people. Discussions on debt restructuring were in progress. The Government was in dialogue with United Nations agencies as well as bilateral partners to protect the most vulnerable from the adverse impacts of the crisis. Sri Lanka would endeavour to meet the goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Sri Lanka along with several Member States of this Council had opposed resolution 46/1, fundamentally disagreeing with its legitimacy and objectives. Operative paragraph 06 violated the sovereignty of the people of Sri Lanka and the principles of the United Nations Charter. The High Commissioner’s report’s extensive reference to “economic crimes” exceeded the mandate of the Office., The proposed twenty-second amendment to the Constitution introduced several salient changes which would strengthen democratic governance and independent oversight of key institutions, as well as public scrutiny, participation in governance, and combatting corruption. Amendments included the establishment of the Constitutional Council and the reintroduction of the National Procurement Commission and the Audit Service Commission. Sri Lanka had extended a standing invitation to all thematic Special Procedure mandate holders to visit Sri Lanka, and facilitated a high number of visits in the recent past. The State looked forward to constructive engagement with the Council through the Universal Periodic Review process. It was time to reflect realistically on the trajectory of the resolution, which had continued on the agenda of the Council for over a decade. The State’s immediate concern was economic recovery, but advancing the human rights of Sri Lankan people was of equal priority. The State looked forward to the genuine support and understanding of the Council in this regard., Discussion, Some speakers welcomed the formation of a more inclusive Sri-Lankan Government and constitutional reform. The peaceful transition of power and the efforts taken to restore peace and stability were applauded. Some speakers acknowledged the difficult circumstances Sri Lanka was facing, expressing solidarity with the Sri Lankan people. The current crisis presented significant challenges, but could also offer an opportunity to advance reforms, ensuring inclusiveness. Some speakers welcomed the major progress made by Sri Lanka when it came to human rights and appreciated the Government’s commitment to advancing human rights in the country. Sri Lanka’s commitment to a constructive approach provided space for engagement. Some speakers commended the Government of Sri Lanka for its sustainable progress despite many challenges, and for its clear commitment to remain engaged with the United Nations system, including the Human Rights Council., Sri Lanka’s achievements in the pursuit of post-war reconstruction were recognised, including the rehabilitation and social reintegration of more than 12,000 former members of armed groups, some speakers said. The amendments to the Prevention of Terrorism Act this year were seen as an initial step in a long-awaited legal reform, while fundamental reform was needed to bring counter-terrorism legislation fully in line with international standards. Some speakers encouraged efforts by the Sri Lankan Government to reach national reconciliation, aimed at stabilising it and ensuring the adoption of a common vision for the promotion of human rights on their territory., Some speakers were concerned about the current situation in Sri Lanka, which was characterised by an economic crisis and violations of fundamental human rights. They were deeply concerned by increased food insecurity, shortages of fuels and medicines and reductions of household income, and urged Sri-Lankan authorities to take all measures to guarantee Sri Lankans’ social and economic rights. There were high levels of concern around freedom of expression, as peaceful protests resulting from the crisis situation were met with violence. Sri Lankan authorities were urged to protect the freedom of expression and assembly for all, and to stop the arbitrary arrests of those engaging in peaceful protests., There was an urgent need to strengthen mechanisms for investigating violations of international law and transitional justice, some speakers said. More than 13 years after the end of the civil war, the search for truth, justice and reconciliation had brought limited progress, and despite the establishment of transitional justice mechanisms, accountability had never been fulfilled. Therefore, some States supported an ongoing monitoring of the situation by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. They called on the Government to adhere to its international human rights obligations and to establish an inclusive process towards reform supported by all parts of the population. The establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission by the Government would also be a welcome start., There was concern about recent reports of the increased vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence in Sri Lanka, with some States asking how this could be addressed. Some speakers stated dismay at the use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act against student activists, despite an alleged moratorium, urging Sri Lankan authorities to repeal the Act and stop its use. Concern was expressed at the constitutional commitment to give Buddhism special status, as ethno-religious tensions had been fuelled by Buddhist nationalist groups in Sri Lanka since 2012. Some speakers were also disturbed at the lack of progress in investigating the 2019 Easter bombings, and the delay to the publication of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, calling for the Inquiry’s publication; a follow-up independent investigation; and justice for the victims and their families., Some speakers reiterated their position to reject country-specific initiatives, and resolutions that were confrontational and did not have the consent of the country concerned. Imposing mechanisms on a country without consent was counter-productive; the support of the country concerned was critical in the achievement of human rights. Instead, it was important to provide technical assistance to Sri Lanka and strengthen its national institutions, to ensure it had the required support, in accordance with its sovereignty. Some speakers maintained that the mandate was costly, with no effect on the situation, and did not support solidarity. The Council was urged to support the Sri Lankan Government in achieving economic and social recovery., Concluding Remarks, NADA AL-NASHIF, Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights, reiterated the continued commitment of the Office of the High Commissioner to maintaining a dialogue with Sri Lanka. Restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis had exacerbated the impact of violence on women. Support efforts required a gender-sensitive approach. The Office had encouraged a transitional roadmap that included mechanisms for identifying criminal accountability. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission needed to be independent and have significant financial resources. Existing mechanisms had failed because they had failed to win the confidence of victims and their families. States were encouraged to empower victims and civil society. Young people and women should be given meaningful roles in establishing accountability. There was also a need to establish accountability for economic crimes., Ms. Al-Nashif said Sri Lanka was at a critical juncture. Sustainable recovery, development and peace could only be achieved by eliminating impunity. The Office of the High Commissioner encouraged the international community to support Sri Lanka in its recovery and work to end impunity in the State. The Council should remain engaged in the issue and continue to support recovery efforts in the State.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/human-rights-council-discusses-situation-human-rights-myanmar-and-sri-lanka

Shelter and Non-Food Items",9 Sep 2022,"Five years after 700,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh, and a decade after intercommunal violence rocked Rakhine State, those who remain live in a state of limbo., Over the course of her life, Zaw Bedah, a 27-year-old Rohingya woman living in Myanmar’s western Rakhine State, has had to adapt to increasing restrictions on her rights and freedoms., In 2012, intercommunal clashes rocked Rakhine State. Zaw Bedah was 17 at the time and had just started her own family. Together with tens of thousands of others, they were forced to flee., A decade later, over 153,000 Rohingya like her remain displaced, the majority of them confined to camps. An additional 447,000 live in villages where they have little freedom of movement, affecting their ability to obtain healthcare, attend school or make a living. Another 700,000 Rohingya fled a further round of violence in 2017 and now live as refugees in Bangladesh and elsewhere in the region., Restrictions on the amount of land the camps can occupy have meant that many are unable to expand to accommodate growing populations. Living in a crowded camp with limited sanitation facilitates and a growing family has brought hardships for Zaw Bedah. “I have difficulties sleeping because there is not enough space for the eight of us in our shelter. I often go to my neighbour’s house to sleep,” she says., Access to healthcare is an additional challenge. Now enduring a difficult pregnancy with her third child, Zaw Bedah is unwilling to seek medical care due to a cumbersome and costly administrative process involving the need for approval from local administrators, male escorts, and navigating security checkpoints where extortion is common., “I get upset when complications occur during childbirth,” says Hassinah Begom, a midwife who attends to the needs of Zaw Bedah and other pregnant women in the camp. Despite not having had any formal training, she has successfully delivered over 500 children during her two-decade career and is often the first person mothers call on when they need assistance., “In serious cases, I have to quickly accompany them to the hospital. We cannot leave if it is past 6pm because of the curfew. When we do go, only one person is allowed to accompany the patient, and we are not allowed to bring our phones. We also pay higher prices for medication,” says Begom. “Thankfully, no mother has died under my care.”, To improve living conditions and heal historical wounds, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and its partners have supported the Rohingya, Rakhine and other displaced communities in Rakhine State through distributions of household items, shelter reconstruction, livelihoods support and services. Such assistance is aimed at reducing vulnerabilities such as gender-based violence while promoting dialogue between different communities., But policies such as denying equal access to citizenship and essential services, as well as movement restrictions, have kept the Rohingya marginalized and highly dependent on humanitarian aid. “No amount of aid is enough to solve the crisis,” says Federico Sersale, UNHCR’s head of office in Sittwe, the Rakhine state capital. “While it is imperative to assist, access to rights and freedoms, social cohesion between communities, the closure of camps, and allowing the Rohingya to return to their homes or places of choice are crucial to lasting solutions.”, Even after giving birth with little or no medical care, women living in the camps continue to worry for their children. Birth certificates are rarely issued to Rohingya children, a key document that provides them with a legal identity., “It saddens me that none of the children born here have birth certificates.”, Zaw Bedah’s second child, who was born in the camp, never received a birth certificate. Her eldest child had one, but it was lost during the chaos of their displacement in 2012. “I’ve tried many ways to obtain a new one for him, but it has been impossible,” she says., “It saddens me that none of the children born here have birth certificates. No one can grow up to be successful without one,” says Begom., Determined to help as best she can, she has diligently recorded the date of birth for every child she has delivered. “My wish is for these records to help children obtain identity documents one day,” she says., Restricting the Rohingya’s access to civil documents like birth certificates has long term consequences. As children grow up, they are unable to acquire other important identity documents such as national registration cards, leaving them legally and administratively invisible. This in turn jeopardizes their future prospects, limits their freedom of movement and traps them in a cycle of poverty and marginalization., “The longer this situation persists, the more vulnerable and marginalized the Rohingya communities become. This will further diminish the prospects for those in Bangladesh who wish to return safely,” says UNHCR’s Federico Sersale., Ajam Bibi, a 16-year-old living in the camp who Begom helped deliver as a baby, had to drop out of school at the age of 14 because her mother could not afford the fees. “I love to learn. If I have a chance to complete my studies, I will apply for a job with a humanitarian agency … Right now, I do chores and help my younger siblings with their studies,” she says., While primary education is often provided by humanitarian agencies for free inside camps, state-run high schools are often located far from camps and segregated from other communities. School fees and transportation costs add to the financial strain faced by cash-strapped families, a situation exacerbated by the lack of employment opportunities., Reflecting on the difficulties faced in her own life and those of her children, Zaw Bedah worries about the future. “I feel sad and unhappy with the situation … I cannot imagine what life will be like when the children grow up,” she says., Written by, Reuben Lim

The impacts of attacks on education and military use in Myanmar,Analysis,GCPEA,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",9 Sep 2022,"Summary, In 2020 and 2021, the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack (GCPEA) identified over 450 reported attacks on education and incidents of military use of schools, universities, and educational facilities in Myanmar by state armed forces and non-state armed groups, the majority of which occurred after the military takeover on February 1, 2021., Reported attacks on schools increased from approximately 10 in 2020 to around 190 in 2021, an increase of approximately 1,800 percent. Furthermore, GCPEA found that attacks on schools spread from at least three to 13 states and regions in Myanmar following the military takeover, with a peak in May 2021, and often involved the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects., Military use of schools and universities was also pervasive in Myanmar and further threatened the safety and security of education. Military use alone can have grave consequences for education, since armed forces and armed groups often damage schools or universities while using them as a base or for other military purposes, and their presence places students and educators still attending the institutions at risk. Worth noting, however, is that military use can also provoke rival forces or armed groups to target the educational facility, yet further risking lives and damage. Military use may turn schools and universities into military objectives, rendering them lawful targets of attack during armed conflict. In the data collected, GCPEA found that over a quarter of schools and universities used for military purposes in 2021 were subsequently targeted by rival forces or armed groups., The widespread targeted attacks on, and military use of, schools, universities, and education infrastructure in Myanmar has created a hostile educational context for students, parents, and educators, who have found it increasingly challenging to make safe choices with regards to their learning, their children, and their jobs. GCPEA remains concerned about both the short and long-term consequences of this severe learning interruption and its broader implications for teaching and learning, from pre-primary through higher education., Key recommendations, Armed actors should protect the civilian character of schools and universities and cease attacks and threats of attacks against students, teachers, academics, and educational facilities., Armed actors should refrain from using schools and universities for military purposes, including by implementing the Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict., Non-state armed groups should sign and implement Geneva Call’s Deed of Commitment for the Protection of Children from the Effects of Armed Conflict, including as it relates to educational spaces., Armed actors should allow access for humanitarian actors delivering education to the most vulnerable children., Armed actors should refrain from politicizing education, and safeguard access to all levels of education., States and international justice mechanisms should support efforts to hold perpetrators of attacks on education accountable in impartial and independent courts., Education providers, humanitarian and development agencies, and donors should commit to supporting communities and local organizations to facilitate flexible ways to continue education.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/impacts-attacks-education-and-military-use-myanmar
"Education in the crossfire in Myanmar: Attacks on schools, use by military and armed groups, skyrocketed after 2021 takeover",News and Press Release,GCPEA,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",9 Sep 2022,"New York, 9 September 2022 – In Myanmar, violent attacks on schools increased to over 190 in 2021, from ten in 2020, the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack (GCPEA) said in a report released today, the third United Nations International Day to Protect Education from Attack., As conflict intensified in Myanmar following the February 2021 takeover, attacks on schools occurred in 13 states and regions, up from three in 2020., The report, The Impacts of Attacks on Education and Military Use in Myanmar, also found a sharp increase in military use of schools and universities after the takeover, with over 170 cases reported in 2021. The Myanmar military and armed groups used education facilities primarily as bases, but also as detention sites, to store weapons, and as fighting positions. Use of schools by armed forces and armed groups upends education as parties to the conflict typically damage schools or universities, while their presence endangers students. More often, it also leads to the institutions shutting down and setting back learning, sometimes for years. Families are particularly wary of sending girls to schools used by armed forces and armed groups, for fear of them falling victim to sexual and other forms of violence., Military use of schools and fighting nearby also increases the risk of explosive remnants of war, including unexploded ordnance, contaminating schools and routes to and from them, creating long-term dangers. In addition, military use can convert schools and universities from civilian objects into legitimate military objectives, putting them at risk of attack. GCPEA found that over a quarter of schools and universities used for military purposes in Myanmar in 2021 were later targeted, threatening lives, and destroying education infrastructure., “Myanmar’s armed forces and armed groups should take all feasible measures to avoid using schools and universities,” said Diya Nijhowne, GCPEA Executive Director. “Research has shown that military use of schools can increase the risk of violence, sexual abuse, and recruitment of children by armed forces and armed groups, putting learning spaces, students, and teachers, in the line of fire.”, Globally, around 40 percent of all reported military use of schools, universities, and other education facilities occurred in Myanmar in 2020 and 2021, according to GCPEA’s Education under Attack 2022 report. In the last two years, military use of education facilities occurred in 24 countries, with the total number of cases doubling as compared to the 2018 and 2019 period., The Safe Schools Declaration, a political commitment to protect students, educators, schools, and universities during armed conflict, and endorsed by 114 countries, plays an essential role in preventing attacks on education and mitigating their impacts, including by restricting military use of schools. By endorsing the Declaration, countries commit to using the Guidelines for Protecting Schools and Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict. As of 2015, over a dozen countries have made changes to their national policies and practices, including their military manuals, to limit the use of schools for military purposes., The Myanmar military and armed groups should incorporate the Guidelines into their doctrine and practice and abide by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2601(2021), which urges all parties to armed conflict to respect the civilian character of schools.

Ensuring sexual and reproductive health and rights for youth and adolescents in Myanmar through innovation amid COVID-19 pandemic and political crisis,News and Press Release,UNFPA,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",7 Sep 2022,"YANGON, Myanmar— “There is social stigma existing in our community to speak about sexual and reproductive health especially concerning adolescents and youth. People are too shy to talk about it. Since we have grown up under this shadow, we don’t even know that young people have the right to access sexual and reproductive health information,” said Thura, 15, a local youth from Yangon., Young people in Myanmar face different social and cultural barriers to get right information about sexual and reproductive health and rights. Without having access to sexual and reproductive health information including family planning, young people tend to experience consequences such as unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion, leading to other life-threatening complications. According to 2014 Myanmar Population and Housing Census, the fertility rate of females aged 15-19 was 33 births per 1,000 women. Comparing to urban areas, the teenage fertility is higher in rural areas of states and regions. The data highlights the needs to enhance protection and promotion of sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and young people in remote places and in areas undergoing humanitarian crisis., The COVID-19 pandemic and political crisis has exacerbated the situation. “Movement restrictions and security concerns hinder young peoples’ access to information and services. How can our rights be fulfilled under these situations? We young people feel like we are lost,” said Thura., UNFPA, the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, works closely with partner organizations in Myanmar to enhance protection and promote sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and young people. In delivering its mandate of sexual and reproductive health and rights, overarching framework of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action and its follow-up convention of ICPD+25, addressing adolescent sexual and reproductive health issues, including unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted diseases, through the promotion of responsible and healthy reproductive and sexual behavior and reducing adolescent pregnancies are also core areas of UNFPA’s work., UNFPA, in collaboration with partner organizations and civil society organizations CSOs, facilitates access to sexual and reproductive health for adolescents and young people through innovative approaches. Aung Pike Tun, Programme Coordinator of Marie Stope Myanmar said, “Previously, we provided sexual and reproductive health awareness (in-person) sessions for young people at our youth corner. Due to COVID-19 pandemic and security concern, we adapted the situation and transformed these in-person awareness sessions into comprehensive online learning space. With the support of local youth networks and initiatives, we are able to connect virtually with many young people from different states and regions and provide SRHR awareness and information that they need. It is a huge step-up. For some young people, they feel comfortable and safe via this virtual platform and raise their issues openly for our support. We are so happy to see their interest and active participation going forward.”, With the support from Global Affairs Canada, UNFPA Myanmar has launched Baykin 2 mobile application, partnering with 360ed team. Integrating with Augmented Reality (AR), Baykin 2 app is designed to introduce adolescent and young people in Myanmar to key topics on sexual and reproductive health & right, gender equality, gender-based violence and other youth related contents. This application integrates learning and gaming to increase the engagement of young users and provide better visuals for learning about their bodies and rights. It additionally seeks to equip adolescents and young people with knowledge and tools to be aware of and thus less vulnerable to gender-based violence., Dr. Peter Kivunike Mukasa, SRHR Programme Specialist of UNFPA Myanmar said, “UNFPA as a Sexual and Reproductive Health Lead Agency, is working with its implementing partner organizations not only to deliver life-saving SRHR and gender-based violence services for women and girls in Myanmar, but also to promote essential SRHR information and GBV awareness for adolescents and young people. To ensure their rights even during this challenging context, we have adapted to the situation quickly and acted innovatively to support them.”, Mya Kalyar Kyaw, 23, a local youth from Kayin said, “Sexual and reproductive health information does save the lives and future of young people. This is not a luxury that we want. This is our fundamental right to access SRHR information without any exception”.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/ensuring-sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-rights-youth-and-adolescents-myanmar-through-innovation-amid-covid-19-pandemic-and-political-crisis

Contributions
Recovery and Reconstruction",7 Sep 2022,"FAO and Belgium provide emergency agricultural assistance to conflict-affected communities in Kayin and Kayah states, Humanitarian needs in Myanmar continue to rise sharply since February 2021 as a result of political and economic upheaval and increased conflict. Approximately 27 percent of the population (14.4 million people) is in need of assistance and more than 700 000 people are internally displaced., Agriculture is a source of livelihoods for nearly 70 percent of the population of Myanmar. The ongoing crisis is compouding the impacts of recurrent climate-induced shocks and COVID-19, posing an enormous threat to the livelihoods and food security of agriculture-dependent communities. Food production is declining, food prices are soaring, and 13.2 million people are already food insecure (compared to 2.8 million before the crisis). Moreover, according to the latest Food Security Monitoring Assessment by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Programme, 16 percent of surveyed households from 14 states/regions across the country do not have sufficient food intake1. In this context, vulnerable households are increasingly resorting to negative coping mechanisms such as the distress selling of their productive assets, which erodes their capacity to manage future shocks., Through SFERA, the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium contributed USD 500 000 to FAO to mitigate the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable households. With this generous contribution, FAO will provide emergency agricultural assistance to 2 000 vulnerable households (10 000 people) in conflict-affected Kayin and Kayah states, in eastern Myanmar. The intervention will include cash-based interventions to enable food-insecure households to cover their immediate needs. Moreover, FAO will provide the beneficiaries with vegetable production packages to enable them to produce up to 500 kg of nutrient-rich vegetables (worth USD 200 on the local market). The intervention will focus on female headed households (61 percent) and will be implemented during the dry season (August 2022–May 2023).",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-belgiums-contribution-through-special-fund-emergency-and-rehabilitation-activities-sfera

The renewed conflict follows a temporary ceasefire between the AA-MAF, which had been in place since November 2020., Most of the fighting has been reported in Maungdaw, Rathedaung, Buthidaung, and Mrauk-U townships in Rakhine State and in Paletwa township in Chin State., As of 5 September, almost 9,600 people have consequently been displaced, bringing the total number of internally displaced people (IDPs) from past and present AA-MAF fighting across Rakhine and Paletwa township in Chin State to nearly 84,000, according to UN latest figures., Key roads and waterways have been blocked, restricting the movement of civilians and preventing humanitarian assistance from reaching people in need., Local and international partners have been providing emergency assistance to affected people where access is permitted but many areas remain unreachable. Humanitarians need unimpeded access to affected areas and the removal of bureaucratic obstructions to allow for the delivery of timely, life-saving support to people in need., Funding is urgently needed to replenish depleted supplies and address expected shortages, especially in food assistance, water and sanitation services, shelter and non-food items (NFIs) and health services for IDPs and other affected communities.

Only 33 per cent opened in Kachin, Kayah, and Chin states while, in Sagaing region, around half the schools are closed because of the conflict. Levels of violence and instability have worsened, causing large-scale internal displacement and disrupting children’s opportunities to learn safely., The Mine Action Area of Responsibility (AoR) reported 185 incidents of landmines and explosive ordnance from January to June 2022 of which 33 percent of the casualties are children. UNICEF continues to work towards providing assistance to the victims and increasing explosive risk education for children and their parents., UNICEF and its partners have seen a marked improvement in Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) indicator. 40,834 people were assisted during the period, a 53 per cent increase compared to the previous month, due to the implementing a variety of methods including virtual access and hotlines, capacity building and communities empowering, allowing expanded access in hard to reach areas., A total of 3,568 children aged 9 to 18 months were vaccinated against measles in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan during the reporting period., Situation in Numbers, 5,000,000 children in need of humanitarian assistance (HRP 2022), 14,400,000 people in need (HRP 2022), 974,400 Internally displaced people after 1 February 2021 (UNHCR), 45,500 People displaced to neighbouring countries since 1 February 2021, 330,400 people living in protracted displacement before February 2021 (UNHCR), Funding Overview and Partnerships, UNICEF Myanmar Country Office is appealing for US$151.4 million to deliver humanitarian assistance to displaced people and host communities across the country. The Myanmar Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) estimates that, in 2022, 14.4 million people, including 5 million children, need assistance. From January to August 2022, UNICEF has received generous contributions from the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/BHA), the European Commission/ECHO, the German Federal Foreign Office, Global Thematic Humanitarian Funds, Denmark, Japan, Norway, the Korean Committee for UNICEF and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). UNICEF Myanmar has so far received US$31.93 million; an increase of US$0.8 million from the previous reporting period. This fund has already contributed to delivering much-needed assistance through UNICEF programmes for Nutrition, Health, HIV/AIDS, Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Education, Child Protection, Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies (GBViE), Protection of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA), Social Protection, Accountability Affected Population (AAP) and Cluster coordination. The Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) appeal had a funding gap of 79 per cent by the end of August. This affects humanitarian assistance and services to the targeted populations, especially children in need. Continued support from donors means that UNICEF can scale up responses and accelerate service deliveries to the population in dire need. UNICEF expresses its sincere appreciation to all private and public sector donors for their contributions to supporting the children of Myanmar., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, Overall, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate across the country, with an escalation in armed conflict in the northwest and southeast regions and in Kachin state, resulting in increased displacement. As of 29 August 2022, an estimated 974,4001 people had been internally displaced since February 2021, which has resulted in more than 1.3 million internally displaced people living in camps, protracted settings and informal displacement sites across the country., The northwest region remains the most affected by the crisis with more than 665,700 displaced people; these are mainly in Sagaing (528,300), Magway (98,100), and Chin (39,300). An estimated 44,300 people crossed the border to the Indian states of Mizoram and Manipur. More than 22,544 civilian properties including houses, churches and monasteries have been destroyed or burnt in the northwest region. Access to the area for aid workers has not improved, as the de facto authorities maintain tight control on issuing travel authorizations. The United Nations continues to engage with the authorities to try to gain better access to more townships in the northwest region. The Humanitarian Country Team has approved an Inter Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG) for the northwest, which will address strategic operational issues., The number of displaced people in Kachin state increased from 1,600 as of 25 July to 10,000 by the end of August. This is in addition to the 91,500 displaced people living in protracted situations since before 2021. During the first week of August, more than 2,300 people (53 per cent women) were displaced in Hpakant township, Kachin State due to intensified clashes. UNICEF, in partnership with Karuna Mission Social Solidarity (KMSS), provided WASH supplies to 111 households in the displacement sites., In Rakhine, the humanitarian situation remains unpredictable due to the heightened tension and clashes between the Arakan Army and the Myanmar Armed Forces. Access to locations with high humanitarian needs, such as Maungdaw north, remains severely constrained, impacting the ability of humanitarian actors to provide assistance to the population in need. Across the state, 219,000 people remain in a situation of protracted displacement., In northern Shan state, a total of 656 people were displaced in Nawnghkio township due to armed clashes during 5 August and 7 August, but they returned to their homes on 12 August. Humanitarian agencies are finding it harder to access camps for displaced people in southern Shan and Kayah due to increased restrictions on movement of humanitarian assistance. The security situation in Kayah state is deteriorating as clashes continue, particularly in Hpruso and Demoso townships. In the southeast, armed conflicts have escalated across the region, specifically in Bago East where the number of displaced people has risen sharply to 33,800 by the end of August.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-myanmar-humanitarian-situation-report-no-7-1-july-31-august-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",2 Sep 2022,"Changes in Context, The people of Myanmar continue to face an unprecedented political, human rights, and humanitarian crisis that is posing grave protection risks for civilians, limiting access to vital services including health and education, and driving deep food insecurity. Humanitarian needs have worsened across the country as conflict continues to rage, causing unprecedented levels of displacement, destruction of property, and land mine contamination especially in the country’s northwest and southeast and driving grave protection risks for civilians. Forced recruitment – including of children – is being increasingly reported. The use of heavy weapons, including air strikes and artillery fire, continues to claim lives and pose risks to the safety and security of civilians, while raids, random searches and arrests are of grave concern. The destruction of civilian properties, particularly homes, combined with the protracted fighting, is prolonging the displacement of IDPs and further degrading people’s fragile living conditions., The arrival of the monsoon in the second quarter of the year has been a miserable time for the hundreds of thousands of displaced people living in informal sites and in the jungle or forest without proper shelter.
While there have been modest access openings, these are very localized, and the overall access environment remains heavily constrained with a strong reliance on and risk transfer to low-profile local responders.
Humanitarian operating space is under increasing threat from bureaucratic blockages imposed by the de facto authorities around registration, travel, banking, and visas. While the economy has shown a glimmer of improvement in the past few months, inflation is undermining this modest recovery at the household level with fuel and food becoming increasingly unaffordable and adding to financial stress in vulnerable households., Expansion of conflict, In the first half of the year, fighting has further escalated across multiple states and regions in Myanmar, particularly in the Northwest and Southeast, with no signs of abating. According to the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, since the military takeover, nearly 2,000 civilians have been killed during hostilities and other fatal incidents, including as a result of landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERWs).1 Nearly 20,000 civilian properties, including houses, churches, monasteries, and schools, are estimated to have been destroyed during hostilities, although figures are difficult to verify., The Northwest has seen the greatest intensification of conflict between the MAF and PDFs and the biggest surge in displacement since the original HRP was published. Now, more than half of all new IDPs are in the Northwest, with the heaviest concentration in Sagaing. There have been various waves of fighting in different states across the Southeast as the MAF has attempted to take control of EAO-controlled areas., Across the Southeast, fighting intensified in January and February as the MAF intensified campaigns in Kayin and Kayah states. In Kayin state, combined MAF/Border Guard Forces and combined KNU/ PDF forces clashed frequently and intensely. Heavy artillery shelling and airstrikes in these areas caused mass displacement, including across the border into Thailand. During the same period fighting escalated substantially across nearly all of Kayah state between the MAF and the aligned Karenni resistance groups., Loikaw town, in particular, experienced a sustained campaign of aerial bombardment that caused 80 per cent of the town to be displaced to other parts of Kayah state and southern Shan. Fighting also intensified throughout other parts of the Southeast, particularly during the second quarter, with heavy clashes and sudden spikes in displacement in Mon, Tanintharyi and eastern Bago between the MAF and aligned militia groups and the KNU and PDFs.
In Rakhine, a ceasefire between the MAF and Arakan Army (AA), continued to hold at mid-year but tensions are building with sporadic confrontations presenting the very real risk that the conflict could resume in the second half of the year. Intermittent clashes, numerous mine incidents, arrests, and counter-arrests on both sides have been reported with some smallscale displacement. Contingency planning has been undertaken in case the situation worsens.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-response-plan-2022-mid-year-report-1-january-june-30

Rural Karen community enjoys new access to water in dry season [EN/MY],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Water Sanitation Hygiene,24 Aug 2022,"Water for everyone, Written by Cho and Ye Min Aung, Travel fourteen miles out of Hlaing Bwe town and a further four miles along a narrow dirt road that connects village to village, and you arrive at the tiny settlement of Upper Me Pa Ra., Set alongside a lively, bubbling stream and surrounded by paddy fields and mountains, its 219 dwellings house a population of 1200, most of whom belong to the Karen ethnic group. The community’s primary source of income is rice production., Upper Me Pa Ra village is administered by the Karen National Union (KNU). The village tries to maintain a peaceful way of life, despite frequent clashes between the KNU and the Myanmar military over the years. The community meets each eruption of armed conflict with resilience., In addition to armed conflict, the community faces a second challenge – the dry season from April to June leaves them dramatically short of clean drinking water. In the past, the villagers relied on shallow tube and hand-dug wells that inevitably dry up at the height of summer. The only alternative is water from the stream. But as U Ba Aye, leader of the community water committee, explains, it is polluted by run-off from the paddy fields that includes animal waste and insecticides used by farmers., As a solution, villagers in Upper Me Pa Ra created a gravity-flow water supply system and water storage tanks for households to collect water. However, these interventions weren’t enough to deliver sufficient water for the entire community., In early 2022, teams from UNICEF and the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA Myanmar) assessed the water, sanitation and hygiene needs in the area. And upper Me Pa Ra village was selected for an upgrade of its water supply system., “Now the families in our village can get water any time,” said U Ba Aye. “Both pregnant women and children no longer need to fetch water. If they need water, they just open the tap. The pipeline provided by UNICEF and ADRA Myanmar can give a lot of water, so we have sufficient water throughout the year.”, Local families are delighted with the new and upgraded water supply system. “We used to get water from the stream on our way home from work. But that is a thing of the past. We now have running water from a pipeline that is connected to our house,” said 67-year-old Dar Mu Bu., UNICEF and local partners have established reliable water systems for eight villages in Hlaing Bwe, providing clean drinking water to approximately 6,100 people, including 2500 children., Naw Pe Naw enjoys the fact that she can now bathe her son close to their home without having to walk long distances to fetch water. “In the past, it took so much time to carry water from the community wells. Now, we no longer need to fetch water as the running water reaches our house. This gives me more time to take care of my child and family.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/rural-karen-community-enjoys-new-access-water-dry-season-enmy
"Dooplaya District Incident Report: Killing of a civilian by unidentified assailant(s), May 2022",Situation Report,KHRG,Protection and Human Rights,31 Aug 2022,"(Excerpt), This Incident Report describes a killing case that occurred in Kaw T’Ree (Kawkareik) Township, Dooplaya District. On the night of May 23rd 2022, unknown armed men entered Saw E---’s house and shot him dead without giving a reason. Although there was a witness to the incident, she could not identify who the perpetrators were because it was dark and she did not feel safe turning on her torchlight. The victim’s family members suspect that the perpetrators might be soldiers, but are unsure which armed group. There are several armed groups operating in the area, including the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO), Democratic Karen Benevolent Army (DKBA), People’s Defence Force (PDF) and State Administration Council (SAC). The victim’s family do not know why he was murdered and local authorities are not carrying out an investigation to get justice. Therefore, it is not only the victim’s family members who feel insecure; the other villagers who live near the incident place are also afraid of further incidents.[1], Part 3 – Complete Description of the Incident, Describe the Incident(s) in complete detail. For each incident, be sure to include 1) when the incident happened, 2) where it happened, 3) what happened, 4) how it happened, 5) who was involved, and 6) why it happened. Also describe any villager response(s) to the incident, the aftermath and the current living situation of the victims. Please use the space prepared below, and create an attachment if needed., On the night of May 23rd 2022, at about 10:30 pm, while all the villagers were sleeping, the perpetrator(s) entered Saw E---’s house in H--- village, Soo K’Lee village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township, Dooplaya District and killed him using a gun, without providing a reason. Daw[4] Y--- [who was also in the house at the time] said she was only aware of one intruder in the house, but it is possible that there was an additional person. She believes the perpetrator was a male soldier in uniform. The man entered the house with a torchlight and rummaged around the house without asking permission from the house owner, Saw E---, to enter the house. It happened while Saw E--- and Daw Y--- were sleeping in the house. The man [perpetrator] woke them up by shouting, “Hey! Hey!” [While the two were still in bed,] the man told Saw E--- to take him to a goat shed which is not far from his house, so Saw E--- replied, “I don’t have any friends with me. […] I will call a friend to accompany me.” The man did not say anything, so they [Saw E--- and Daw Y---] went down [the ladder] from the house to go to the goat shed. [They heard the man follow them.] Daw Y--- came down from the house first and she heard the sound of gunfire once, while she was on the ladder, but she could not see where the bullet was coming from because it was dark. Then, she heard gunfire a second time while she was putting on her flip flops. Saw E--- had descended the ladder and was standing beside her, and then she saw Saw E--- fall to the floor with blood coming from his mouth [he was likely hit by the second bullet]. Therefore, Daw Y--- ran for her life, to escape from the perpetrator(s). Daw Y--- testified that, “It [the bullets] nearly hit me. I think if I didn’t [bend down to] put my shoes on, both of us would have been hit. When I looked at [Saw E---], he fell down without a word. His mouth was full of his blood. Then, that person [the perpetrator] ran this way and I ran that way [in different directions]. I fell over many times along the way, while I was running. I dared not turn on my torchlight.”, It happened during the night and there was a high security risk [in the village], so although Daw Y--- was calling for help from other villagers, villagers were concerned about leaving their houses. The victim’s relatives had to wait until they felt secure to retrieve the corpse. They washed Saw E---’s corpse because his body was covered in his blood. They saw that a bullet struck his left armpit [travelled through his body and out through his hip] and through his right wrist. Villagers suspect that although two bullets were fired, only one bullet hit him., They kept the casing [of the two bullets] and showed the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army (DKBA)[5] commander, Lieutenant General Bo[6] Steel, [unknown battalion] asking him whether he would be able to help them with an investigation to identify the perpetrator. According to Daw Y---, “We took the casing [of the bullets] to Bo Steel and one of his soldiers said there were two guns that were used. […] He [Bo Steel] asked me, ‘Do you know the perpetrator?’ I said I did not know or recognise him because it was dark. He said [he thought] they were [from] Kawthoolei [Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[7] or Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO)[8]] when he looked at the bullets. He was unable to help any further because we couldn’t give him any details [about the perpetrators].”, Another interviewee, Saw T--- said, “When we looked at the casing of the bullets, [we found that] they came from two different guns. I collected an AK [AK-47 bullet casing] and an AR-16 [bullet casing], so there might have been two perpetrators. When I looked at the place where he [the victim] was standing and the wound on his arm and armpit, one [of the perpetrators] might have been standing behind him and another one might [have been standing] beside [to one side of] him. The two bullet shells landed in different places.” [Nevertheless, it is difficult to ascertain where the perpetrator(s) were in relation to Saw E--- at the time of the shooting since Daw Y--- stated that it was dark and she herself could not determine where the gunfire was coming from.], Two types of guns must have been used during the incident [and thus it is likely that there was more than one perpetrator], but the witness could not clarify how many perpetrators came to the incident place and who the perpetrators were because it was dark and she did not feel safe turning on the torchlight to see who was coming. However, she assumes that the perpetrator [at least one of the perpetrators] was a soldier because she saw that he was wearing a [utility] belt on his waist and that he was Karen because he talked to her in Karen. As Daw Y--- explained, “I don't know how many [gunmen] came. It was dark, so I only saw one. […] Maybe that person was a soldier, because he had a [utility] belt on his waist.” However, she could not say which armed group the soldier was from because she could not see his badge and there are several types of armed groups in her community: the KNLA, KNDO, People’s Defence Force (PDF)[9], DKBA (Benevolent) and the State Administration Council (SAC)[10]. Another interviewee, Saw Z--- said, “We do not know which [armed] group it was. It might have been a soldier. There are several armed groups [operating in the area], so we cannot guess [which armed group they could be from]. We're not sure if it's yellow [DKBA], black [KNLA/KNDO], or the Burma Army [the SAC]. They might have been soldiers. They are probably not ordinary civilians. If they were ordinary civilians, they might not have [these kinds of] advanced guns.”, Saw E--- was killed unexpectedly. The villagers don’t know the reason that he was murdered and local authorities have not taken action to investigate the case. Therefore, it is not only Saw E---‘s family members who face security concerns. All of the villagers who live near the incident place also feel insecure and the area is not safe for civilians. The family would like to know the truth and want the authorities to take action to reveal the truth, but no local authorities have taken action for them [the family]. No one encouraged the relatives of the victim to report the case and look for the perpetrator. One of the interviewees stated, “I want to know if it's [Saw E---]‘s fault. If it is [his] fault, we can accept it [that he was killed]. We all want to know what happened. […] I haven’t seen anyone [authorities] take responsibility in finding the perpetrator.”, Since November 2021, H--- villagers and many villagers from other villages in Kaw T’Ree Township, Dooplaya District had to displace to the border because of fighting between the KNDO, and the combined forces of the Border Guard Force (BGF)[11] and the SAC. The villagers had been displaced for about six months [at a semi-formal displacement site along the Thai-Burma border]. The month of May was the time to start preparing the land for farming and they were greatly concerned for their livelihoods in the coming years. Therefore, many villagers from different areas returned to their villages to start working on their farms. Saw E--- returned to H--- village, Soo K’Lee village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township, but most of the family stayed at the IDP site due to the high security risk that comes with returning home [as this incident demonstrates]. About 10 days after he returned home, Saw E--- borrowed corn seed from other villagers and also bought petrol in order to prepare his land for farming. [This was shortly before he died.], As the wife of the victim lost her husband, who was the main breadwinner of the family, she faces livelihood challenges in raising her five young children alone (she has six children, but her eldest son is married). It rained heavily between May 18th and 21th 2022, so the temporary shelters of many internally displaced people (IDPs) were destroyed by flooding from the Moei River, including the shelter of Saw E--- and his family [adding to their current livelihood challenges]. It is also hard for the family to deal with the emotions of losing a beloved family member; and the victims’ family members do not feel satisfied with the incident because he was an innocent civilian. The family of the victim expressed sadness that they have lost their family member and wonder what mistakes he could have made that caused his death. The family did not think that he had made any mistakes, as he worked day by day as a farmer.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/dooplaya-district-incident-report-killing-civilian-unidentified-assailants-may-2022

Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",30 Aug 2022,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Bu Tho Township, Mu Traw (Hpapun) District from June 2021 to August 2021. Skirmishes occurred between the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) and the combined forces of the State Administration Council (SAC) and Border Guard Forces (BGF). A villager was shot in the shoulder by SAC troops and sent to a hospital in Thailand for treatment. Three villagers were arrested, beaten and used as porters and human shields before they were released. Due to the intensification of fighting and air strikes, many villagers have displaced to nearby forests. Some villagers received humanitarian support from Karen organisations in the months of June and July. SAC troops and the KNLA continue to plant landmines. A villager lost his leg after stepping on one of these landmines. COVID-19 continues to spread in Bu Tho Township and is having a significant impact on villagers’ ability to travel.[1], Introduction, This situation update covers the period from June 1st 2021 to August 31st 2021. It describes landmine incidents, the activities of State Administration Council (SAC)[2] troops, humanitarian aid to support civilians, and the impact of COVID-19., SAC troop activity, Every day from August 1st 2021 to August 31st 2021, there were skirmishes between the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[3] and the combined forces of the SAC and Border Guard Forces (BGF)[4] along the road from Kamarmaung [K’Ma Moh] to Hpapun towns., On August 16th 2021, Saw[5] A---, a 24-year-old unmarried man from O--- village, Hkaw Poo village tract, Lu Thaw Township, went to visit R--- village, Hkaw Poo village tract. He encountered troops from SAC Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[6] #341 and #410 [who were patrolling in Hkaw Poo village tract] on his return to O--- village. As a result, he was shot in the right shoulder by the SAC troops [without being questioned]. After Saw A--- was shot by the SAC troops, he was sent to a hospital in Ei Tu Hta IDP camp for two days, and then he was transferred to a hospital in Thailand. He was not discharged from the hospital within the reporting period., On August 19th 2021 at 1:00 pm, SAC LIB #341 and LIB #410 soldiers were travelling back from T’Khay Hkoh army camp [in Bu Tho Township] to Hpapun Town when they met three female villagers who were going to their farms. The three villagers were Naw Dv--- (65 years old), Naw Dw--- (56 years old) and Naw Dx--- (42 years old) and they are from Dy--- village, Hkaw Poo village tract, Bu Tho Township, Mu Traw District. The SAC soldiers arrested these three villagers, kicked them and stepped on their heads without questioning them. The SAC soldiers also threatened them by firing a machine gun two times into the sky. After torturing and threatening them, the SAC soldiers ordered the three villagers to carry loads for them from Dy--- village to Dz--- village and used them as human shields along the way. Then, the three villagers were released. [The SAC troops then continued to Hpapun Town.][7], On August 20th 2021, SAC LIB #338 travelled from Hpa-an District to Thoo Mweh Hta army camp and then Meh Leh Hta army camp, located in Buh Ah Der village tract, Bu Tho Township, Mu Traw District. [KHRG’s field researcher was unable to find out the name of the SAC battalion commander from LIB #338.] Thoo Mweh Hta and Meh Leh Hta army camps are close to U--- village, Z--- village, B--- village, N--- village and S--- village in Bu Ah Der village tract, Bu Tho Township. There were a total of 60 SAC soldiers from LIB #338 who travelled to Mu Traw District [on August 20th]. Local villagers did not know why these SAC troops travelled to Mu Traw District. The Karen National Union (KNU)[8] and KNLA leaders thought that these SAC troops came to capture Meh Ra Hta army camp in Bu Tho Township, from the KNLA., On August 27th 2021, over 80 SAC soldiers from LIB #409 also travelled from Hpa-an District to Bu Ah Der village tract, Bu Tho Township, Mu Traw District. During this time, some soldiers from BGF Battalion #1014 travelled with SAC LIB #409. They [soldiers from SAC LIB #409 and BGF Battalion #1014] travelled to the same area as SAC LIB #338 [Thoo Mweh Hta and Meh Leh Hta army camps]., Displacement and humanitarian aid, Civilians [living in Bu Tho Township] were in fear because they saw that aircraft from the SAC was frequently conducting reconnaissance in their area and [villagers living close to the military camp] were also afraid that they [SAC aircraft] would drop bombs [into the villages]., With the intensification of SAC military activity, [most] villagers [from village tracts located in Bu Tho Township] fled to live in the forest beginning in February 2021 [since the military coup] and had to stay in the forest for one to two months. After one or two months of displacement, some villagers returned to live in their villages to feed their livestock. Some villagers have remained displaced since February 2021., From July 24th to 25th 2021, villagers from Bu Ah Der village tract, Bu Tho Township received humanitarian aid [cash and food] from the Karen Office for Relief and Development (KORD), as well as other local organisations. Villagers each received 850 baht [USD 23.54][9] [in cash]. This was a one-time distribution [of aid]., During the last week of July 2021, villagers from Meh Klaw village tract, Bu Tho Township also received support from the Committee for Internally Displaced Karen People (CIDKP) and each of them received 50,000 kyats [USD 23.81][10]. In June 2021, Meh Nyu Hta village tract, Bu Tho Township also received support from CIDKP and KORD., A landmine incident, On August 23rd 2021 at 10:20 pm, Saw C---, aged 37, from K--- village, Hkaw Poo village tract, Bu Tho Township, Mu Traw District, stepped on a landmine. Saw C--- is a married man with three children. His eldest son is 10 years old and his youngest child is 2 years old. He is a farmer., Saw C--- stepped on a landmine that was believed to have been planted by SAC LIB #341. The exploded landmine was on a road that villagers [frequently] use to travel. The villagers were not informed about where the landmines had been planted. Therefore, it has become a challenge for local villagers, including K--- villagers [to travel in the surrounding area]., In contrast, the KNLA informed local villagers [from K--- village] in advance regarding the areas where they had planted the landmines [if in the vicinity of villages]. When local villagers have been informed about the location of the landmines ahead of time, they have faced fewer landmine incidents., Following the landmine incident, Saw C--- was sent to P--- hospital. Since the hospital did not have enough medical supplies, Saw C--- was sent to receive medical treatment at a hospital in Thailand on August 25th 2021 [and stayed at the hospital for treatment for one month]. His right leg was injured due to the landmine explosion [and it had to be amputated]. Since he lost his leg, his family’s livelihood has been impacted. During the reporting period, his family has not received support from any organisations.[11], The impact of COVID-19, The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing in Bu Tho Township, Mu Traw District. From June to August 2021, the disease became widespread across areas of Mu Traw District. On August 28th 2021 alone, 29 villagers tested positive for COVID-19 in areas of Mu Traw District. The KNU restricted travel in order to prevent COVID-19 prevalence. Villagers living both on the road to Hpapun Town and in mountainous areas [of Bu Tho Township] have been facing difficulty buying food. Thai authorities also did not allow civilians to travel [across the Thai-Burma border]. The villagers from areas of Bu Tho Township were afraid to go to the Thai side of the river to buy food. Therefore, villagers have been facing difficulties travelling and accessing food because of the COVID-19 pandemic. [Prior to the coup,] there was proper care to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, the villagers [cannot travel because they] are afraid of the SAC military and COVID-19., Conclusion, In the past, [before the military coup,] villagers were only afraid of militarisation. Now, they are afraid of [SAC] air strikes. Moreover, villagers have faced difficulty travelling due to the COVID-19 pandemic., Further background reading on the security situation and human rights violations in Mu Traw District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in August 2021. It was provided by a community member in Mu Traw District who has been trained by KHRG to monitor human rights conditions on the ground. The names of the victims, their photos and the exact locations are censored for security reasons. The parts in square brackets are explanations added by KHRG., [2] The State Administration Council (SAC) is the executive governing body created in the aftermath of the February
1st 2021 military coup. It was established by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on February 2nd 2021, and is composed of eight military officers and eight civilians. The chairperson serves as the de facto head of government of Burma/Myanmar and leads the Military Cabinet of Myanmar, the executive branch of the government. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of SAC chairperson following the coup., [3] The Karen National Liberation Army is the armed wing of the Karen National Union., [4] Border Guard Force (BGF) battalions of the Tatmadaw were established in 2010, and they are composed mostly of soldiers from former non-state armed groups, such as older constellations of the DKBA, which have formalised ceasefire agreements with the Burma/Myanmar government and agreed to transform into battalions within the Tatmadaw., [5] Saw is a S’gaw Karen male honorific title used before a person’s name., [6] A Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) comprises 500 soldiers. Most Light Infantry Battalions in the Tatmadaw are under-strength with less than 200 soldiers, yet up-to-date information regarding the size of battalions is hard to come by, particularly following the signing of the NCA. LIBs are primarily used for offensive operations, but they are sometimes used for garrison duties., [7] This incident was previously reported in KHRG, “Southeast Burma Field Report: Intensification of armed conflict, air and ground attacks, and widespread human rights violations, July to December 2021”, March 2022., [8] The Karen National Union (KNU) is the main Karen political organisation. It was established in 1947 and has been in conflict with the Burma/Myanmar government since 1949. The KNU wields power across large areas of Southeast Burma and has been calling for the creation of a democratic federal system since 1976. Although it signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement in 2015, relations with the government remain tense., [9] All conversion estimates for baht are based on the August 24th 2022 mid-market exchange rate of 1 baht to USD 0.02774 (taken from https://wise.com/gb/currency-converter/mmk-to-usd-rate)., [10] All conversion estimates for the kyat are based on the August 24th 2022 mid-market exchange rate of 1000 kyat to USD 0.48 (taken from https://wise.com/gb/currency-converter/mmk-to-usd-rate)., [11] Previously reported in KHRG, “Mu Traw District Incident Report: A male villager was injured in a landmine explosion in Bu Tho Township, August 2021”, December 2021.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/mu-traw-district-situation-update-militarisation-displacement-humanitarian-aid-landmines-and-impact-covid-19-bu-tho-township-june-august-2021
Monitoring the Agri-food System in Myanmar - Agricultural Input Retailers – July 2022 survey round,Assessment,IFPRI,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",31 Aug 2022,"To understand the effects of political instability, COVID-19, and other shocks on Myanmar’s agricultural input sector, a phone survey of 252 input retailers throughout the country was conducted in July 2022., Key findings, Input prices during the 2022 monsoon growing season were substantially higher than a year prior, especially for urea (91 percent higher) and for compound fertilizers (75 percent higher)., Despite large disruptions in transportation and currency exchange, inputs were generally available. However, because of rising prices, input sales dropped sharply relative to 2021. Input retailers have attributed their drop in sales to rising transportation charges, political instability, changing demands, and, alarmingly, a decline in acreages planted by farmers., The decline in fertilizer sales appears to be especially severe in the Delta region, which accounts for about half of Myanmar’s monsoon paddy production. In contrast, aggregate fertilizer sales quantities increased slightly in the Hills region due to high maize prices and export demand., Looking forward, As a result of price increases and sales declines for inorganic fertilizer, perhaps most severe in the major rice growing regions, Myanmar may see declines in paddy production in the 2022 monsoon season, a large concern given rice’s importance in diets nationwide and for rural incomes., One positive development has been the return of in-person bank transfers as a method of payment, but otherwise there is little sign of relief in the input retail sector as problems with high transport costs and credit availability are likely to continue.  Providing farmers with advice on nutrient management practices and fertilizer use efficiency is highly recommended to help maintain profitable yields under the constraints of high fertilizer costs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/monitoring-agri-food-system-myanmar-agricultural-input-retailers-july-2022-survey-round

Food and Nutrition",31 Jul 2022,"Highlights, The cost of the basic food basket (rice, edible oil, chickpeas, salt) remained stable but remains high (+34%) compared to the same time last year., The average prices for locally-available low-mid quality rice remained stable with slight changes between June and mid-July. However, starting from late July rice price increases have been reported in various parts of the country, which will be further validated as part of the August market price update., Edible oil prices remained stable or slightly decreased from previous month due to increased palm oil export availability from Indonesia as the world's leading exporter., Onion prices also surged this month due to low domestic stocks and increase in foreign demand. In some regions, prices are 3-4 times higher than the same time last year., The price of eggs overall stabilized, but with some variability across markets.
In Chin and northern Rakhine, increases were associated with high transportation costs and high costs of chicken feed., Chickpea prices high in Mon State due to decline in retail stocks and high transportation costs, Fuel price decreased by -21% on average during July. However, prices remain significantly higher than one year ago, and reports of fuel shortages in early to mid-August have led to renewed price increases outside the monitoring period.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/wfp-myanmar-market-price-update-july-2022

Joint Ministerial Statement Marking 5th Anniversary of Myanmar Military’s Attack Against Rohingya and Ensuing Crisis,News and Press Release,EU,Protection and Human Rights,24 Aug 2022,"August 24, 2022 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada, The following is the text of a joint statement by the High Representative on behalf of the European Union, and the Foreign Ministers of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States, marking the fifth anniversary of the Myanmar military’s attack against Rohingya., “Five years ago, the Myanmar military launched a violent attack on Rohingya communities in Rakhine, killing, raping, and torturing thousands of Rohingya men, women, and children and forcing over 700,000 to seek refuge in Bangladesh – where they joined other Rohingya, who had fled earlier attacks and decades of systemic discrimination. These deplorable actions against Rohingya precipitated one of the largest mass exoduses of a minority in recent history. We are concerned by the UN Fact Finding Mission’s establishment of consistent patterns of serious human rights violations and abuses, of which many amount to grave crimes under international law. We also recognize other initiatives to hold perpetrators accountable, including The Gambia’s efforts before the International Court of Justice, which is currently examining whether the atrocities committed by the Myanmar military against Rohingya amounted also to genocide. We reiterate that Myanmar must comply with the International Court of Justice’s provisional measures order., “The same actors that committed these reprehensible actions led the military coup d'état in February 2021, and today continue to perpetrate atrocities against political dissidents and vulnerable populations, including other ethnic and religious minorities across Myanmar, and have done so for decades. The Rohingya themselves suffer human rights violations and abuses, discrimination, systematic persecution, and denial of access to basic services – including the right to citizenship. Around 150,000 Rohingya have been confined to camps without freedom of movement in Rakhine for a decade. Women and girls continue to be at extreme risk under the current conditions., “As we mark five years since the brutal 2017 campaign against Rohingya, we commend the courage of Rohingya communities and remember all the victims. We reiterate our commitment to holding the perpetrators of these violations and abuses to account, and acknowledge the work of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar and others contributing to this objective. We call on the military regime to cease its violence against those who have suffered under its rule, including the decades of grave human rights violations and abuses endured by Rohingya and other communities in Myanmar., “We thank the UN relevant bodies, Bangladesh, and other hosting nations for their generosity and providing lifesaving support to Rohingya and remain dedicated to supporting Bangladesh to ensure that the needs and rights of all refugees and impacted host communities are met. We also appreciate the important efforts of humanitarian organizations to extend protection and assistance for Rohingya communities. At the same time, we call on the international community to help to ensure justice for Rohingya victims, support host communities, and foster conditions that will allow for the safe, voluntary, dignified, and sustainable return to their communities. Rohingya must be meaningfully included in discussions around the future of Myanmar.”, Contacts, Adrien Blanchard

Joint Ministerial Statement Marking 5th Anniversary of Myanmar Military’s Attack Against Rohingya and Ensuing Crisis,News and Press Release,Govt. Canada,Protection and Human Rights,24 Aug 2022,"August 24, 2022 - Ottawa, Ontario - Global Affairs Canada, The following is the text of a joint statement by the High Representative on behalf of the European Union, and the Foreign Ministers of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States, marking the fifth anniversary of the Myanmar military’s attack against Rohingya., “Five years ago, the Myanmar military launched a violent attack on Rohingya communities in Rakhine, killing, raping, and torturing thousands of Rohingya men, women, and children and forcing over 700,000 to seek refuge in Bangladesh – where they joined other Rohingya, who had fled earlier attacks and decades of systemic discrimination. These deplorable actions against Rohingya precipitated one of the largest mass exoduses of a minority in recent history. We are concerned by the UN Fact Finding Mission’s establishment of consistent patterns of serious human rights violations and abuses, of which many amount to grave crimes under international law. We also recognize other initiatives to hold perpetrators accountable, including The Gambia’s efforts before the International Court of Justice, which is currently examining whether the atrocities committed by the Myanmar military against Rohingya amounted also to genocide. We reiterate that Myanmar must comply with the International Court of Justice’s provisional measures order., “The same actors that committed these reprehensible actions led the military coup d'état in February 2021, and today continue to perpetrate atrocities against political dissidents and vulnerable populations, including other ethnic and religious minorities across Myanmar, and have done so for decades. The Rohingya themselves suffer human rights violations and abuses, discrimination, systematic persecution, and denial of access to basic services – including the right to citizenship. Around 150,000 Rohingya have been confined to camps without freedom of movement in Rakhine for a decade. Women and girls continue to be at extreme risk under the current conditions., “As we mark five years since the brutal 2017 campaign against Rohingya, we commend the courage of Rohingya communities and remember all the victims.

The fight for justice: five years since the violence that led to large-scale displacement of the Rohingya from Myanmar,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,25 Aug 2022,"Statement by Nicholas Koumjian, Head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, Geneva, 25 August 2022 – Five years ago today, a wave of violence uprooted most of the Rohingya population of Rakhine state in Myanmar. Men, women and children were forced to flee from their homes, many losing their livelihoods and loved ones. About three-quarters of a million Rohingya, more than half of them children, escaped across the border to Bangladesh where they now remain., While the scale of the 2017 displacement is particularly shocking, we must not forget the estimated 130,000 Rohingya who remain confined to makeshift camps in Myanmar following deadly violence a decade ago, and the tens of thousands more that were displaced during the waves of violence in-between. Every one of these events is a tragedy. But the greatest tragedy is that the Rohingya are still waiting to return home, and with every day that passes their suffering grows., Justice is one critical step to enable a safe and dignified return home. However, those that are responsible for the crimes against the Rohingya have still not been held to account. At the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, we are working to change that. We are contributing to the fight for justice for all the Rohingya that lost their lives, family members and homes. We are collecting evidence of serious international crimes committed against them and others in Myanmar. We are accumulating the proof to identify the individuals responsible for killing and displacing innocent civilians, as well as those who fueled and facilitated such horrors with their words, money or authority., At the Mechanism we know that the wheels of international justice can turn very slowly, which only increases the suffering for the victims of crimes. We are doing all we can to produce results as fast as possible. But we cannot do this alone. The Mechanism has no authority to compel cooperation from any individual, entity or state. We cannot arrest anyone. We cannot hold our own trials. Rather, our mandate is to provide evidence to courts or tribunals who have jurisdiction over such crimes now or in the future, so that judges have what they need to determine the truth of what happened. To do this, we rely on the cooperation of individuals, businesses, civil society organizations and governments to share information with us and to facilitate our investigations., Access to witnesses and victims is vital for us to piece together the details of crimes against Rohingya and so many others in Myanmar. To those who witnessed or suffered from such crimes – your experiences are crucial building blocks of our evidence. We invite you to tell us what you saw. And to those that had access to inside information about plans, actions and orders that led to the crimes – tell us what you know. We have processes in place to receive your information confidentially and securely. We are already sharing relevant information – with the consent of those who gave it to us – with the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice., Five years on, the Rohingya face an ongoing tragedy. We must all work together to ensure that perpetrators of the most serious crimes committed against them are brought to justice, and that Myanmar becomes a country to which they can return home and live with safety and dignity., The Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM or Mechanism) was created by the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2018 to collect and analyse evidence of the most serious international crimes and other violations of international law committed in Myanmar since 2011. It aims to facilitate justice and accountability by preserving and organizing this evidence and preparing case files for use in future prosecutions of those responsible in national, regional and international courts., *For more information visit https://iimm.un.org/ or contact *iimm@un.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/fight-justice-five-years-violence-led-large-scale-displacement-rohingya-myanmar
Fifth Year Of ‘Never Again’: Rohingya Await Justice Amidst International Inaction,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,25 Aug 2022,"The Asia Justice Coalition is a network of organizations whose purpose is to promote justice and accountability for gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of international humanitarian law in Asia, and to contribute to the fulfillment of the rights of victims and their families., In August 2017, more than 730,000 Rohingya were forced to flee the Myanmar military’s so-called ‘clearance operations’ from Rakhine State to Bangladesh. Five years later, there has been little progress in furthering their cause for justice and accountability., In February 2021, the military junta staged a coup, declared a state of emergency, and imposed martial law across the country. The current post-coup situation in Myanmar has only furthered the impunity enjoyed by the Myanmar military. The illegal action of the military was met with nationwide protests calling for the restoration of civilian government. Myanmar’s army responded to the situation with excessive and lethal force. Since then, they have committed widespread and systematic attacks against civilians amounting to crimes against humanity and war crimes. Over 2,239 people have been killed, and more than 12,119 are currently detained by the military junta. Military-perpetrated violence in Myanmar continues to escalate, with the highest violence committed against civilians by the state forces since the coup witnessed in the first half of 2022., Current Situation of the Rohingya in Myanmar and in Refugee Camps, Approximately 600,000 Rohingya remain in Myanmar despite the atrocities committed against them by the Myanmar military. The February 2021 coup has further exacerbated the discrimination, violence, and crimes against the Rohingya. Last year, the junta imposed systematic and unjustifiable restrictions on the exercise of freedom of movement, arbitrary arrest, and stricter punishments concerning alleged migration-related offences. Rohingya children are also often used as forced labour by the junta-supported Arakan Army. The harsh living conditions, social exclusion, and threats to the physical security of Rohingya may amount to crimes against humanity of persecution and an apartheid-like situation., The Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh face heightened risks in the refugee camps. The availability of limited means to earn a livelihood, restrictions in accessing education and public health services, and rising security threats have brought misery to the refugees. Moreover, the transfer of Rohingya from Cox’s Bazaar to Bhashan Char, a remote island in the Bay of Bengal that faces regular floods and cyclones has further aggravated the situation. The Rohingya have been further alienated from the host country’s population and face food and water shortages. This vulnerability and desperation often push Rohingya to flee to neighbouring countries despite the risks of arrest, detention, and death. The coup has made women and girls, especially from ethnic minorities like Rohingya vulnerable to the risks of violence, trafficking, and exploitation., Over the past year, the Government of Bangladesh has significantly intensified its focus on the repatriation of Rohingya to Myanmar. Recently, the Bangladesh Prime Minister informed the UN Human Rights High Commissioner of the urgent need to repatriate refugees to Myanmar. However, the Rohingya must be recognized legally as full and equal citizens of Myanmar, and any repatriation must be safe, dignified, and voluntary., Earlier this year, the US State Department formally determined the acts committed against the Rohingya in Rakhine State by the Myanmar military in 2016–2017 constituted ‘genocide and crimes against humanity’. While such condemnation is welcomed, the US government must follow up with strict diplomatic and economic isolation measures., International Legal Proceedings regarding the Rohingya, The international proceedings against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the ongoing investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC) are important measures for accountability but remain a distant and slow process. These legal proceedings are built on the credible and painstaking advocacy and documentation work led by Rohingya., In July 2022, the ICJ rejected Myanmar’s preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the Court and proceeded to the merits stage under the Genocide Convention (The Gambia v. Myanmar). Two years ago, the ICJ issued binding obligations on Myanmar through its provisional measures order, namely to prevent commission of genocidal acts; to ensure its military, police and other forces within its control do not commit genocidal acts; to preserve all evidence of genocidal acts; and to submit compliance reports every six months until a final judgment by the Court. However, the facts on the ground reflect the blatant disregard and violation of these binding obligations by the military junta., While proceedings at international courts are moving forward, the international community has failed to take sufficient action against the ongoing impunity in Myanmar and is complicit in maintaining the status quo. States such as the United States and the UK should formally intervene and support the genocide proceedings before the Court. Canada and The Netherlands have already expressed their intention to intervene and must take the next steps., The repeated refusal of the UN Security Council to hold a public meeting, pass a resolution and refer the situation in Myanmar to the ICC for a wider investigation, goes against the essence of the UN Charter of maintaining international peace and security. The adoption of the recent resolution – ‘Standing mandate for a General Assembly debate when a veto is cast in the Security Council’ must guide the Council to act regardless of the potential exercise of a veto and it must take urgent stock of the situation in Myanmar and mandate concrete actions., Similarly, States must actively facilitate the investigation and prosecution of Myanmar officials under the principle of universal jurisdiction such as in the case of Argentina.

"Five years into the Rohingya crisis, UN Special Representative Pramila Patten urges for enhanced efforts related to justice and accountability for the survivors of sexual violence",News and Press Release,OSRSG Sexual Violence in Conflict,Protection and Human Rights,25 Aug 2022,"New York, 25 August 2022: The Rohingya refugee crisis enters its fifth year at a time of unprecedented global turbulence caused by armed conflicts and increased militarization that has devastated lives, healthcare systems, economies and societies. While ultimately the solution to the plight of the Rohingya lies in Myanmar, the country is yet again going through another political turmoil, aggravated by the military takeover in February 2021 by the Tatmadaw, Myanmar’s armed forces, which has put the Rohingya people further into uncertainty. “I acknowledge the extremely generous response by the Government of Bangladesh to the Rohingya refugee crisis, in a climate of constrained resources. Under these circumstances, I urge the international community to take action and continue to stand in solidarity with the Rohingya survivors of grave international crimes to ensure access to justice and redress, which is foundational for recovery and peace”, Special Representative Patten said., “In 2017 and 2018 during my visits to the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, I had witnessed firsthand the visible scars on women and girls from the sexual violence they endured. All of the women I spoke with said they wanted to see the perpetrators punished. They all – without exception – demanded justice”, she added. Since 2010, the annual reports of the Secretary-General on conflict-related sexual violence have documented patterns of sexual violence crimes in Myanmar. Moreover, in 2019 the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar concluded that “rape and sexual violence are part of a deliberate strategy to intimidate, terrorize or punish a civilian population, and are used as a tactic of war” and was one of the hallmarks of the military operations conducted by the Tatmadaw., The Myanmar’s society has now started to urge their leaders to recognize the Rohingya as an ethnic nationality, entitled to citizenship and other collective and individual rights, and to ensure accountability and reparations for the crimes committed against them. This encouraging shift means no more that the people of Myanmar are confronting history and are willing to work towards lasting solutions to build peace and reconciliation. “We must heed the call of the people of Myanmar and work collectively towards ensuring justice which has been delayed for far too long. I reiterate my call for enhanced efforts by the international community to continue supporting the dignity and well-being of the Rohingya community and to ensure that perpetrators will be held accountable and that survivors will have effective access to reparations and redress. I call for the collective search of lasting solutions for one of the most persecuted people on earth”, the Special Representative concluded., NOTE TO THE EDITORS: Since 2018, the Tatmadaw has been listed by the Secretary-General in the annual report on conflict-related sexual violence, as being credibly suspected of having committed patterns of sexual violence. A Joint Communiqué to address conflict-related sexual violence was signed between the United Nations and the Government of Myanmar in 2018, aiming at bringing perpetrators to justice, including members of the military at all levels. While the Joint Communiqué provides a framework for accountability and security sector reform, regrettably, the Tatmadaw is yet to take any meaningful measures to prevent or address these violations, pursuant to this agreement., For media inquiries, please contact:, Ms. Géraldine Boezio, Office of the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Tel: +1 917 367 3306 Email: geraldine.boezio@un.org, Follow us on social media @endrapeinwar",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/five-years-rohingya-crisis-un-special-representative-pramila-patten-urges-enhanced-efforts-related-justice-and-accountability-survivors-sexual-violence
Rohingya stories: We were treated as pariahs,News and Press Release,MSF,Protection and Human Rights,24 Aug 2022,"Five years after a forced exodus from Myanmar, Rohingya refugees share hopes and fears, On August 25, 2017, the Rohingya people in Myanmar were the targets of a [large-scale campaign](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/no-one-was-left-violence-against-rohingya-myanmar """"No One Was Left"": Violence against the Rohingya in Myanmar"") of merciless violence. More than 700,000 people fled for their lives across the border into Bangladesh in a matter of weeks, joining thousands who had fled previous attacks. Today, nearly one million Rohingya still live in crowded, unsafe, and unsanitary conditions in what is now the largest refugee camp in the world in Cox's Bazar., To mark five years of continued displacement with no solution in sight, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) gathered testimonies from people of different generations with different concerns and fears: Tayeba, a mother of five-year-old twins; 15-year-old Anwar, who misses school and wants to become a doctor; Nabi and Nasima, the parents of young children; Hashimullah, a 45-year-old former businessman; and 65-year-old Mohamed, who worked in the Myanmar government for decades before he and his people were stripped of their citizenship., This is MohamedHussein's story, I graduated from high school in 1973. I even had a job as a government employee because, at the time, Rohingya were recognized under the constitution., After achieving independence from British rule in 1948, the government accepted us as citizens. If someone's father was born in Myanmar and the son was as well, both could be recognized as citizens. People of every ethnicity enjoyed equal rights. No one faced discrimination. , This all changed in 1978, when the Naga Min or “Dragon King” census was conducted. The census determined who was a citizen of Myanmar and who was Bangladeshi. Many people were arrested for not having proper documents. Scared for my life, I fled. Later, the government of Myanmar took us back again. They made an agreement with the Bangladesh government, and we were promised if we returned, our rights would be guaranteed., This promise was not kept. Land [was] returned to [its] owners, but our rights were not ensured. This was the beginning of our oppression. We were treated as pariahs, and gradual deprivation turned into persecution. , The authorities stripped us of our citizenship [in Myanmar]. Under the [1982] Citizenship Law, they recognized categories of ethnicity, and percentages of each were announced. This categorization had not existed before. , At this time, despite our citizenship being taken away, Rohingya were still accepted in the country as foreigners. Different regions broadcast the news of Rohingya communities.  After the military takeover, our radio airtime was canceled. , We were no longer allowed to pursue higher education. Travel restrictions were imposed, and the military accused us of being involved in conflict with the Buddhists. Reputed members of the Rohingya community were arrested or fined due to allegations of oppressing the Buddhists. Curfews were enacted, and if someone was found visiting another house, he was tortured.  So, we started keeping our mouths shut when something happened in our community. , Every year, they came up with new orders. The ones who failed to comply were arrested.  Despite all of this, we could still vote. We elected members that participated in parliamentary sessions. Then, in 2015, even our right to vote was taken away. , We felt belittled and worried. In the country where our ancestors had been living, we could no longer vote. Our hearts sank when we were called intruders. The unjust treatment came to the point that we had to flee., One morning [in 2017], we heard gunshots. [Then], it was a Thursday night that actual shots were fired from the military post close to our home. The next morning, we heard some Rohingya people had been killed.  , When people saw the military entering our area, they started running away. We were terrified, as the military was arresting and killing people everywhere. Running for our lives, we arrived here in Bangladesh. We were fortunate that we made it here alive. Bangladesh is doing a lot for us and standing by us. , When we first arrived here, we were very hopeful. But now, we feel stuck. Life has become difficult. My heart feels restless because of this., Whenever I go out, I am searched [by the guards]. I cannot even visit my children. One of my daughters lives in Kutupalong [a different area of the mega-camp in Cox's Bazar], and one lives nearby. It takes me a long time to reach their shelters when I try to visit them. The confinement bothers me. I feel anxious about our future because our children are not being educated properly. Whether they stay here or return to Myanmar, what will they do without education? We have many sleepless nights thinking about this. , I receive medical care for my diabetes and high blood pressure at an MSF facility inside the camp, but treatment for my kidney disease is not available in the camp. I cannot go out to get this treatment, so my hope is that it becomes available here.  , I am old now and will die soon. I wonder if I will see my motherland before I die. My wish is to breathe my last breath in Myanmar. I am not sure if that wish will be fulfilled.  , My heart longs for our repatriation to Myanmar, with the guarantee that our rights will be protected and that we will not be persecuted further. I am scared about the possibility of facing persecution again in Myanmar, and since our families are there, we need to think of their safety.   , We would be treated equally in Myanmar if we were recognized as citizens. We should be able to study, lead our lives, and move around like any other citizen of Myanmar. We should be able to vote, participate in elections, and raise our voices in Parliament. , Now that all our rights have been taken away, we are nothing but walking corpses. The world is made for everyone to live. Today, we have no country of our own despite being human.  , I am saying to the world that we are just as human as you are. As we were born as humans, we wish to live a dignified life.  , We are asking the world to help us live as humans. My wish is to have rights and peace. ",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/rohingya-stories-we-were-treated-pariahs
OIC General Secretariat calls on international community to stand firm with the Rohingya people in their Plight,News and Press Release,OIC,Protection and Human Rights,25 Aug 2022,"Today marks five years since the beginning of the massive refugee influx of Rohingya people and other communities from Myanmar’s Rakhine State into Bangladesh., On 25 August 2017, Myanmar’s military started carrying out violent operations against the Rohingya population in Northern Rakhine State, which resulted in grave crimes under international law and forced hundreds of thousands to flee., Five years later, Rohingyas in Rakhine State still lack freedom of movement and other basic rights such as access to adequate food, healthcare and education., This anniversary is a reminder that the crimes committed against Rohingya call for accountability., The OIC pays tribute to the Government and people of Bangladesh for their relentless efforts to provide protection, hospitality, and necessary assistance to Rohingya refugees who have been living in Bangladesh for the past five years. It appreciates the international support, including by OIC Member States, for the cause of these Refugees., The OIC General Secretariat reiterates the OIC’s firm support for the Rohingya people and calls on the international community to stand firm with them in their plight, and to redouble efforts to protect their fundamental human rights, including their right to full citizenship, and to ensure favourable conditions for the safe, voluntary, dignified, and sustainable return of all Rohingya refugees and internally displaced persons to their homeland., The OIC General Secretariat expresses the hope that the recent ruling of the International Court of Justice to dismiss the preliminary objections of Myanmar would contribute to mobilizing the necessary momentum for effective international action that would provide more support for the Rohingya people and contribute to finding a final solution to their constant affliction.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/oic-general-secretariat-calls-international-community-stand-firm-rohingya-people-their-plight
Five years after start of Rohingya genocide: Statement By Administrator Samantha Power,News and Press Release,USAID,Protection and Human Rights,24 Aug 2022,"August 25, 2022 marks five years since members of Burma’s military embarked on a horrific campaign of genocide and terror against Rohingya in Burma. Burma’s military raped, tortured, and murdered thousands in their attempt to destroy the Rohingya people. As their villages were razed, women were forced to flee with their families, and many young children watched as their parents were assaulted or slaughtered., The genocide sparked one of the largest mass migrations in recent history, driving more than 740,000 Rohingya – 400,000 of them children – out of the country. The survivors now face unimaginable consequences – displacement, trauma, and suffering. In response, the people of Bangladesh opened their doors and provided shelter to those fleeing, establishing the refugee settlement in Cox’s Bazar District, Bangladesh, now one of the world’s largest, hosting nearly one million refugees., While the August 2017 attacks on the Rohingya people drew the attention of the world, Burma’s path to genocide began long before. Burma’s military has a long history of dehumanization and demonization of Rohingya as well as other ethnic minority groups. Since the most recent coup, the military continues to persecute the Rohingya people and violently crack down on civilians across all communities., USAID denounces the actions of the military leaders who orchestrated the genocide and were responsible for overthrowing Burma’s democratically elected government in 2021. We acknowledge the horrific violence perpetrated against the Rohingya people, and are outraged by the slaughtering of peaceful protestors and the cold-blooded murder of pro-democracy champions., On this day of mourning, we recommit to the Rohingya people that USAID will continue to support them in their time of need and in their quest for justice and accountability, as well as the generous communities who host them. All individuals, including the Rohingya, deserve justice, respect for their human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the ability to live their lives with dignity and hope for a peaceful future. The United States Government and the American people will not forget the Rohingya people who perished, and all who continue to suffer from the escalating violence perpetrated by Burma’s military.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/five-years-after-start-rohingya-genocide-statement-administrator-samantha-power
"Five years since genocide, the world must act to ensure justice for Rohingya [EN/MY]",News and Press Release,ADI,Protection and Human Rights,25 Aug 2022,"In marking the five-year commemoration of the genocide committed against the Rohingya in 2017, 384 civil society organizations reaffirm our commitment to continue to stand in solidarity with and seek justice for the Rohingya, to ensure the full restoration of their rights in Myanmar, and to end the impunity of the Myanmar military. The plight of the Rohingya must not be forgotten., On this day five years ago, the Myanmar military launched a terror campaign in Rakhine State against the Rohingya and massacred, tortured, raped, and burned villages. They forced three quarters of a million people to flee to Bangladesh where they remain today alongside a quarter of a million Rohingya who fled earlier persecutions in Myanmar. Around one million Rohingya are struggling to survive in crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh, waiting to return to their home and their country in dignity with their full rights restored., The return of Rohingya to Myanmar is substantially predicated on ending the impunity of the Myanmar military and accountability for the grave atrocity crimes the military has committed, including by prosecuting individuals who are most responsible. Yet, progress towards justice and accountability has remained minimal, made even more elusive by the military’s attempted coup on February 1, 2021., As the military commits war crimes and crimes against humanity throughout the country, perpetrating similar crimes committed against the Rohingya in 2017 during its ‘clearance operations’, on 10 August 2022, the junta’s spokesperson for Rakhine State, U Hla Thein, told Radio Free Asia the junta is making plans to repatriate Rohingya refugees to Rakhine State – at the rate of 150 people per day starting in September 2022. This is a part of its ongoing desperate attempt to gain legitimacy from the international community. As recently expressed by the High Commissioner for Human Rights during her visit to Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, “conditions are not right for returns” and “Repatriation must always be conducted in a voluntary and dignified manner, only when safe and sustainable conditions exist in Myanmar.”, Rohingya in Myanmar continue to live under genocidal policies in apartheid-like conditions, systematically denied citizenship, with severe restrictions on fundamental freedoms including freedom of movement, access to health, education and other essential services. They are arbitrarily arrested, detained and treated as criminals for traveling outside of confined areas and further dehumanized for attempting to flee appalling conditions within Rakhine State. The over 130,000 Rohingya that remain in open air prison camps in Rakhine State face new restrictions on movement and aid blockages since the attempted coup. In effect, the genocidal acts of deliberately inflicting conditions of life that are calculated to bring about the Rohingya’s physical destruction, in whole or in part, are continuing to be perpetrated by the military junta, leading to their “slow death”., Emboldened by the lack of international, concerted action to hold the military accountable, the world is bearing witness to the military’s atrocity crimes, amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity, that are now being perpetrated against the wider population in Myanmar as people bravely resist the junta’s ongoing violent attempt to seize power which has failed after 18 months. These crimes are all too familiar to the ethnic communities who have endured decades of atrocities by the Myanmar military., Five years on, words have not turned into robust action as more statements of “grave concern” pile on to the condemnation of military’s atrocity crimes. Actions must speak louder., We welcome the ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the preliminary objections lodged by the military junta in the case of Rohingya genocide brought forward by The Gambia, which has paved the way for the court to adjudicate the merits of The Gambia’s case. With this ruling, governments must send a strong message to the Myanmar military that they will be held accountable for their crimes by supporting The Gambia’s case – including lending legal, financial and technical support. In addition, the UN Security Council, and the UK as the “penholder” on Myanmar, must convene a meeting on the progress of the implementation of the provisional measures., Efforts to hold the Myanmar military criminally accountable must be expedited. This includes supporting universal jurisdiction cases to prosecute the military, in particular the universal jurisdiction case in Argentina. It is vital that the international community continue to explore other avenues for full justice and accountability, including a UN Security Council referral of the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court or to set up an ad-hoc tribunal., We welcome the US government’s determination earlier this year that crimes committed against Rohingya amount to genocide. Five months have passed since this decisive step. The US must bolster accountability efforts by joining The Gambia case at the ICJ and impose further sanctions including sanctioning the Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) – one of the junta’s main sources of foreign currency revenue., The Myanmar military continues to enrich themselves through their businesses and are enabled by the web of arms brokers that supply them with weapons and equipment to carry out their atrocity crimes. There must be further efforts to impose targeted sanctions against their businesses, partners and cronies. Governments must impose arms embargo against the military, including on jet fuel to the military, while working towards a coordinated global arms embargo., The ongoing crimes against the Rohingya underscore the importance of the National Unity Government (NUG), as the legitimate government of Myanmar, to translate the policy of the NUG into a concrete set of actions and implement the provisional measures ordered by the ICJ. These can include by fully and meaningfully engaging with the Rohingya to restore their equal rights, recognizing the Rohingya as an ethnic and indigenous group to Myanmar, and ensuring their representation in the ongoing political processes, including in the highest echelons of the NUG governing structures. The NUG, the National Unity Consultative Council (NUCC) and the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) must immediately amend the discriminatory 1982 Citizenship Law by removing all discriminatory articles and clauses as pledged in its policy paper, and repeal the racist and xenophobic four “Race and Religion Protection Laws” and the National Verification Process that has long been used as a tool for genocide.

ILO Brief: Riding out the storm: Organizational resilience of trade unions and civil society organizations following the military takeover in Myanmar,Assessment,ILO,Protection and Human Rights,24 Aug 2022,"Myanmar trade unions and civil society organizations face existential threat following military takeover, Targeted persecution severely limits ability to operate; more flexible and responsive support from international community needed to avoid collapse of civic space and worker organizing., BANGKOK, Thailand (ILO News) - The military takeover in Myanmar has taken a severe toll on trade unions and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) providing services to workers and migrants, according to a new report by the International Labour Organization (ILO)., Riding out the storm: Organizational resilience of trade unions and civil society organizations following the military takeover in Myanmar details the severe impact of the February 2021 takeover on trade unions and CSOs., It highlights how the targeted persecution of these groups, including arbitrary arrests, detentions, acts of violence, raids on homes and offices, seizure of equipment, threatening phone calls, interrogations and surveillance, have substantially limited their ability to operate., Trade unions and CSOs reported being forced to make major adjustments to their work in response to the heightened safety and security concerns since the military takeover., “Trade unions and Civil Society Organizations have provided the foundation for much of the progress made on increasing labour rights protection in Myanmar over the last decade.

The international community must stand with these organizations to help them survive and continue their vital work,” said Panudda Boonpala, ILO Deputy Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific., The report recommends that the international community increases its flexibility and responsiveness to counter this existential threat to civic space and worker organizing in Myanmar., For more information please contact:, Steve Needham

It’s Time to Share Responsibility: The Rohingya Crisis Five Years On,Analysis,APRRN,Protection and Human Rights,24 Aug 2022,"Urgent Call for Shared Responsibility to address the Rohingya Crisis Five Years On, Bangkok, 25 August 2022: The Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network (APRRN) today launched a Briefing Paper calling for all stakeholders to share responsibility and put an end to the systematic marginalisation of Rohingya five years after more than 742,000 were driven out of Myanmar by brutal attacks in 2017. For decades, the Rohingya have been oppressed, discriminated against, and subjected to targeted violence in Myanmar., “After more than 40 years of persecution, with no solutions in sight, and no clear political leadership, we are all complicit in the ongoing marginalisation of the Rohingya, and we must all begin to accept, and share responsibility if we hope that situation to change,” stated Hafsar Tameesuddin, Chair of APRRN and a former Rohingya refugee.
Co-written by APRRN’s Rohingya Working Group, the paper provides an in-depth analysis of countries of exile where Rohingya have sought refuge, including Bangladesh, Malaysia, India, Thailand, and Indonesia. It highlights the glaring lack of basic human rights and legal protections, the continuous cycle of forced displacement, and the normalisation of Rohingya marginalisation across the region., “The Rohingya themselves are excluded from all stages of the response which compounds the situation, as children are denied an education, youth are forced into idle and hopeless circumstances, refugees are thrown into arbitrary and prolonged detention, and xenophobia is incited to the general detriment of communities. The result is that the conditions become worse rather than better, with ongoing conflict, onward movements, and protracted displacement,” reflects Chris Lewa, Deputy Chair of the Rohingya Working Group., Without access to legal migration channels, boats carrying Rohingya men, women and children are regularly pushed back to sea across the region, while a lack of legal documentation puts them at constant risk of arrest, detention and criminalisation. Women and children remain at serious risks of gender-based violence and trafficking., Key recommendations put forward by the report to improve the many dimensions of protection for the Rohingya include:, ● Begin diplomacy and negotiations for more far-reaching and long-term responsibility-sharing arrangements among the international community, including all states and other actors such as parliaments, humanitarian agencies, donors, civil society, private sector, Rohingya communities, and host communities., ● Embrace a “whole-of-society” approach via stakeholder collaboration in all contexts to identify needs, vulnerabilities and risks and make referrals to each other on the basis of capacities to address those needs., ● Guarantee meaningful participation of Rohingya in decision making ensuring shared ownership of outcomes, support refugee-led initiatives, and recognise that decisions made about Rohingya refugees should be made with Rohingya refugee participation., ● Promote and pursue ALL possible durable solutions: voluntary repatriation in safety and dignity, local integration and resettlement, as well as additional migration pathways., ● Strengthen national and regional protection frameworks, including legal frameworks and state systems that prioritise protection over immigration enforcement., ● End boat push-backs, and develop protection-based timely and predictable disembarkation protocols, including providing immediate assistance to persons rescued at sea, guaranteeing access to a place of safety where risks are mitigated, needs are met, and legal status can be determined, as well respecting customary laws and practices and the humanitarian imperative among non-governmental actors., ● Reject the normalisation of Rohingya marginalisation and urge States and other actors to speak out against xenophobia, and take a proactive approach to welcome the Rohingya into communities and include them in all decision-making bodies, coordination mechanisms, and service provision schemes that affect the Rohingya., ● Improve existing humanitarian conditions and protection environment for Rohingya refugees in every context, including addressing the deteriorating conditions in the camps, providing legal documentation, ending prolonged detention and deportations, increasing access to basic services such as healthcare and education and granting work rights to Rohingya refugees., ● Keep the Rohingya on the agenda amidst the emergence of new global crises., ● Increase financial and capacity support for civil society, including refugee-led initiatives, who are filling the gap left by the failure of State responsibility., An effective and sustained multilateral and multi-stakeholder platform to discuss responsibility sharing and a range of possible solutions and approaches is urgently required to address the many dimensions of Rohingya protection. “Ultimately, addressing the Rohingya crisis effectively will require a paradigm shift that puts Rohingya lives, rights, and futures at the centre, and mobilises leadership, vision and commitment at all levels,” says Lilianne Fan, Chair of APRRN Rohingya Working Group., The full Briefing Paper is available here ., The Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network (APRRN) is a network of over 220 civil society organisations and individuals from 29 countries committed to advancing the rights of refugees in the Asia Pacific region. APRRN aims to advance the rights of refugees and other people in need of protection through joint advocacy, capacity strengthening, resource sharing and outreach., Media Contacts:, Hafsar Tameesuddin, Chair, APRRN chair@aprrn.org, Lilianne Fan, Chair, APRRN Rohingya Working Group: lilianne@geutanyoefoundation.org +60 111 958 7721 Chris à, Lewa, Deputy Chair, APRRN Rohingya Working Group chris.lewa@gmail.com",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/its-time-share-responsibility-rohingya-crisis-five-years
Myanmar: Five-year anniversary of Rohingya crisis must mark ‘turning point’ in quest for justice,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,24 Aug 2022,"The upcoming five-year anniversary of the Rohingya crisis must mark a turning point in the urgent quest to deliver justice to the victims and hold those responsible to account, Amnesty International said today., On 25 August 2017 Myanmar’s military began carrying out violent operations against the Rohingya population in northern Rakhine State, which resulted in grave crimes under international law, whole villages torched, and forced hundreds of thousands to flee into Bangladesh., “This solemn anniversary is a haunting reminder that not a single high-ranking Myanmar military official has been prosecuted for the egregious campaign of violence against the Rohingya,” said Amnesty International’s Ming Yu Hah, Deputy Regional Director for Campaigns., “Amnesty International stands in solidarity with the Rohingya people who are in Rakhine State and the estimated one million refugees living across the border in Bangladesh. Real justice is essential to ending the spiraling cycle of impunity engulfing Myanmar for many years.”, This solemn anniversary is a haunting reminder that not a single high-ranking Myanmar military official has been prosecuted for the egregious campaign of violence against the Rohingya., Amnesty International's Ming Yu Ha, Deputy Regional Director for Campaigns, Five years later, Rohingya in Rakhine State still lack freedom of movement and other basic rights such as access to adequate food, healthcare and education, problems compounded by the rising insecurity brought on by the 2021 military coup in Myanmar. Across the border in Bangladesh, Rohingya refugees are living in limbo with neither the opportunity to safely return to their homes in Myanmar nor a way to live peacefully in Bangladesh, where violence has been on the rise in refugee camps., “We face enormous hardship in the refugee camps,” San thai Shin, a Rohingya refugee in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar camp, told Amnesty International in June. “We do not know how we can ever return to our homes. We are neither safe in the refugee camps nor in Arakan [Rakhine State in Myanmar].”, “Our people are losing their lives to gang violence in the refugee camps, in environmental calamity, or by taking dangerous attempts to migrate to other countries through the deadly seas and other means.”, Importantly, some international justice efforts are moving forward. In July 2022, the International Court of Justice dismissed Myanmar’s objections and decided that it has jurisdiction to continue proceedings instituted by the government of The Gambia against the government of Myanmar in 2019 on the basis of the Genocide Convention., “The International Court of Justice’s decision is a vital step in ongoing efforts to hold Myanmar’s government to account,” Amnesty’s Ming Yu Hah said., The International Criminal Court is also investigating crimes committed in 2016 and 2017 against the Rohingya population. Although Myanmar has not ratified the ICC’s Statute, the Court is examining alleged crimes committed partly in the territory of Bangladesh or other states. Amnesty International has called for the United Nations Security Council to refer the full situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court Prosecutor, so that an investigation of all crimes committed in Myanmar can be conducted., An investigation into other crimes in Myanmar is also being conducted in Argentina under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which permits national authorities to investigate crimes under international law committed anywhere in the world on behalf of the international community. The case, which was filed by the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK), hopes to hold senior military leaders to account for alleged responsibility in crimes against the Rohingya people., These efforts should be supported and other states should also take measures to investigate and prosecute the crimes before their national courts., “The Association of Southeast Asian Nations must also play a more forceful, decisive and leadership role in standing up for the Rohingya people and pushing for accountability in Myanmar,” Amnesty’s Ming Yu Hah said., “We reiterate our call on authorities to respect and ensure the participation of Rohingyas in the decisions that affect them in order to protect their human rights.”, Background:, More than 740,000 Rohingya women, men and children fled northern Rakhine State to neighboring Bangladesh, when in August 2017 Myanmar security forces launched a widespread and systematic assault on Rohingya villages, including extrajudicial killings, destruction of properties and sexual assault. The onslaught came in the wake of a series of what the military claims were insurgent attacks on police posts., Taking into account previous decades of violence against the Rohingya, an estimated one million Rohingya refugees now live in Bangladesh, while many of their homes in Rakhine State have been destroyed without a trace., The UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar previously called for Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and other top military officials to be investigated and prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of Chairman of the State Administration Council following the February 2021 coup., In a report published earlier this month, since the coup Amnesty International documented the crackdown and arbitrary detention of those who exercise their right to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly as well as enforced disappearances, torture and other inhuman treatment in detention., More than 2,000 people have reportedly been killed since the coup, and Myanmar arbitrarily executed four people after grossly unfair trials, the first use of capital punishment in the country in decades., A report by Amnesty International published in July showed that the Myanmar military is committing war crimes by laying banned landmines and around villages in Kayah (Karenni) State, while a report in May showed how the military uses air strikes and shelling as a form of collective punishment against civilians.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-five-year-anniversary-rohingya-crisis-must-mark-turning-point-quest-justice
"Mergui-Tavoy District Situation Update: Shelling, displacement, threats, arrest, travel restrictions and telecommunication shutdowns in Ler Doh Soe Township, April to May 2022",Situation Report,KHRG,Protection and Human Rights,24 Aug 2022,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Ler Doh Soe (Dawei) Township, Mergui-Tavoy District during the period between April and May 2022. State Administration Council (SAC) troops fired mortars into civilian areas causing damage. SAC troops also threatened to burn down entire villages. This SAC activity forced villagers to displace. Villagers were also arrested. While two were released the same day, four others were taken to an army camp where they were tortured, with one villager being tortured to death. The three other villagers were transferred to an unknown location and are presumably still being detained. Furthermore, the SAC cut off phone and internet connections, so villagers could not easily communicate with others and find out what was happening in other areas. Villagers are in fear of shelling and air strikes and are mentally exhausted by the ongoing violence.[1], Shelling, threats and displacement, On April 26th 2022, the local People’s Defence Force (PDF)[2] based in Htee Ler Klay (Da Thway Kyauk) area burned down a State Administration Council (SAC)[3] police station near Pa Ka Yi village, Htee Ler Klay area, Ler Doh Soe (Dawei) Township, Mergui-Tavoy District. That same day, in response, SAC troops based at Tha Byay Chaung army camp in Dawei Town indiscriminately fired [an unknown number of] mortar shells into Pa Ka Yi, Yay Waing, Anya Pya and Htee Ler Klay villages [that are located] to the east of the army camp in Htee Ler Klay area, Ler Doh Soe Township. The SAC troops based at Tha Byay Chaung army camp are from Infantry Battalion (IB)[4] # 401, #402, and #267, and Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[5] #25, all under Military Operation Command (MOC)[6] #8., As a consequence of the shelling, two houses in Pa Ka Yi village were damaged, and some villagers’ farms, plantations and fruit trees, including their betel nut trees, were damaged by the mortar explosions. All of the mortar shells that were fired exploded, so there are no unexploded ordnance (UXO) in the area. However, the SAC planted landmines beside Shay Mai (Si Pin Kaung) Road between Meh Chaung village, located in Htee Ler Klay area and Za Lon village [near Dawei Town], so villagers do not feel secure travelling along the road and working on their farms and plantations [near the road] for their livelihoods., Moreover, SAC IB #402 threatened villagers who they met, [telling them] that they would burn down everything [in the villages] in the area to the east of the army camp [in Htee Ler Klay area]., Due to the shelling and threats, villagers, especially in the eastern part of Htee Ler Klay area [near Tha Byay Chaung army camp], including Pa Ka Yi, Yay Waing, A’Nya Pya, Mae Chaung and Htee Ler Klay villages, fled from their villages to other nearby villages, the monastery in U--- village, their relatives’ villages, as well as to the forest and plantations. All women [including pregnant women], children and elders had to flee for their safety. Local PDF soldiers guarded IDPs on their way to seek refuge in other villages in order to ensure that they arrived safely. One of the villagers, U[7] N---, from I--- village explained that villagers worry about their safety and the dangers that they face. U G--- from Y--- village also said that he worries for the future of the children in the village [including their education and livelihood]., On April 27th 2022, following the fighting, the SAC sent more soldiers from IB #267, LIB #25 and IB #401 (all under MOC #8) from Tha Byay Chaung army camp in Dawei Town to Htee Ler Klay area. [It takes approximately one day to travel between the two points by foot.] They divided their troops into two groups and marched on different roads to Htee Ler Klay area. The first group was IB #267, who left from Tha Byay Chaung army camp and went to Htee Ler Klay area on foot, along Yay Waing Road (which is unpaved). They arrived at Htee Ler Lay area the same day. However, they were attacked by the PDF on their way. [The location and details of the attack is unknown, but villagers nearby could hear the gunfire.], The second SAC group, consisting of LIB #25 and LIB #4, left Tha Byay Chaung army camp [also on April 27th] and travelled along Myitta Road by truck and stopped at Za Lon village. They slept in Za Lon monastery in Za Lon village on the night of April 27th. During the night of April 27th 2022, they indiscriminately fired about 15 mortar shells into Htee Ler Klay area. [It is unknown whether it resulted in any damage to the village. Villagers were told in advance by other villagers that SAC soldiers were coming so they had already fled the village when the shelling began.], On April 28th 2022, this group [LIB #25 and #4] divided themselves into two groups; one of the groups went to Htee Ler Klay area on foot along Zi Pin Kauk Road and the other group went to Htee Ler Klay area by truck along Myitta Road. They [both groups] threatened villagers they saw on the way, stating that they would burn down the villages [in the area] if they were attacked by the local PDF., Then, on April 28th, all three SAC troops met at Mae Chaung village, Htee Ler Klay area and they set up a temporary army base at Mae Chaung monastery. They also set up temporary checkpoints along Myitta Road, between Dawei Town and Pa Ka Yi village, Htee Ler Klay area. Moreover, SAC soldiers in civilian clothes were also patrolling the villages. Soldiers checked the ‘Wave Money’ [money transfer agency] shop in Pa Ka Yi village in order to block funding to the PDF. As the SAC soldiers did not see any money transferred to the PDF, they did not do anything [harm] to civilians. [When transferring money to the PDF, villagers usually transfer larger sums of money in the form of cash. The SAC soldiers did not see a large amount of cash at the shop, so did not suspect that villagers were transferring money to the PDF.], The SAC frequently use Myitta Road to send military reinforcements [to Htee Ler Klay area]. One of the villagers from Htee Ler Klay area, U N--- from I--- village, said, “SAC soldiers that are based in Mae Chaung monastery fired mortars in the direction of Pa Ka Yi and Htee Ler Klay villages. They should not fire mortars to[ward] civilian areas like that. They have to fire at the PDF. The SAC fired at the people, as they think people are their enemies. The main purpose of this update about the [local] situation is to let the SAC know that they should respect human rights.”, As the SAC were operating in Htee Ler Klay area and perpetrating violence against civilians, on April 28th 2022, fighting broke out between the PDF and SAC in Mae Chaung village. Because the SAC were now based in the village [Mae Chaung monastery], fighting broke out in civilian areas many times each day in multiple places in Htee Ler Klay area, through April 29th 2022 [thus, for two days straight]., On April 30th 2022, the SAC [unknown battalion number] under MOC #8 threatened villagers who they saw while they were travelling [between Htee Ler Klay and Dawei Town], including villagers from P’Kant, Htee Ler Klay and other villages in Htee Ler Klay area. They told villagers that they would come to burn down the villages and accused the villagers of supporting the PDF., As fighting stopped on April 30th, the SAC withdrew their soldiers from the villages in Htee Ler Klay area on May 1st 2022, and the situation became calmer in the area., On May 6th, as the fighting had stopped for five days, some villagers returned to their villages to check their houses and livestock. On May 9th 2022, all of the villagers returned to their villages. However, on May 10th 2022, the day after local villagers in Htee Ler Klay area returned to their villages, SAC soldiers [unknown battalion number] under MOC #8 from Tha Byay Chaung army camp, fired [an unknown number of] mortar shells into Htee Ler Klay area. Villagers had to flee for their lives again to other villages and to their hiding sites in the forest. [It is unknown which villages the mortars landed in and if there was any damage or casualties in those villages.], On May 11th 2022 at 6:30 pm, the SAC [unknown battalion number] from Tha Byay Chaung army camp indiscriminately fired 15 mortars into Oo Yin Gyi village, Htee Ler Klay area, Ler Doh Soe Township. Therefore, Oo Yin Gyi villagers had to flee from their village. Between May 12th and 17th 2022, villagers continually heard the sound of mortars being fired in Htee Ler Klay area. This was very terrifying. Villagers, especially children, felt very frightened., On May 20th 2022, SAC soldiers from IB #401 based at Tha Byay Chaung army camp, went to Htee Ler Klay area; some of them went in trucks and some of them went on foot. The trucks were loaded with ammunition including mortar and machine guns. On this day, when they arrived at Htee Ler Klay area, they burned four houses [to the ground] in Mae Chaung village, Htee Ler Klay area and burned one house [to the ground] in Wa Gone village, K’Moh Thway area, Ler Doh Soe Township., On approximately May 30th [exact date unconfirmed], some of the soldiers from SAC IB #401 travelled further [to other places], and villagers assumed that these SAC troops might go and attack the KNDO in other areas of KNU territory. After that, there was no fighting and shelling in Htee Ler Klay area, so villagers returned to their villages on May 30th 2022., Need for international action, IDPs [from Ler Doh Soe Township] requested that KHRG inform international humanitarian organisations about the difficulties that they are facing. SAC troops blocked the road [going to Dawei Town] and prohibited the transportation of food over five sacks of rice [rice being the main food transported] and [all] medical supplies. As many villagers’ farms and plantations are located beside the road, they could not work on their farms and plantations for their livelihoods. IDPs could only bring enough food for a short period of time [a few days]. IDPs are now facing high security risks, insufficient shelter when it rains, and lack of food and medicine in their hiding sites. The IDPs would like to go home, live in peace and in a secure environment. Villagers from Htee Ler Klay area, Ler Doh Soe Township, KNU Brigade 4 [Mergui-Tavoy District] expressed that they are afraid to go back to their villages due to indiscriminate shelling conducted by the SAC., Villagers want Karen Information Centre (KIC) [and other media groups] to broadcast the human rights violations committed by the SAC in their area to make their voices heard, because the SAC should not fire mortars in civilian areas., Arbitrary arrest and torture, On May 21st 2022, SAC IB #401 troops arrested six villagers from Htee Ler Klay village in Htee Ler Klay area, when the villagers returned to their villages to feed their livestock. At first, they arrested two villagers who were feeding their pigs. Another four villagers, who were running to the village monastery when they saw the SAC troops in the village, [were then also arrested]. Later that same day, they released two of the villagers. The other four villagers were kept among the soldiers. [According to an update] on June 24th 2022, some of the SAC soldiers took the other four villagers to Tha Byay Chaung army camp. These four villagers were tortured at the army camp, with one being tortured to death. [It cannot be confirmed whether the body was returned to the family.] The families were able to visit the detained villagers, while they were kept at this army camp. However, on an unknown date, the three villagers were transferred to a prison. Villagers do not know the location of the prison and are not able to visit them. Villagers do not know the reason that these villagers were arrested and detained in this manner., Travel restrictions and cuts to telecommunication services, Since the coup, the situation has been getting worse. People cannot travel freely because roads are blocked by SAC authorities and people are often being questioned [by SAC authorities] when they travel. Moreover, starting from May 20th 2022, the SAC cut phone and internet connections in Ler Doh Soe Township. In particular, these connections were cut when the SAC conducted military operations and attacks. They began cutting phone and internet connections on May 20th 2022 in the eastern area of Ler Doh Soe Township. Affected villages in the eastern part of Ler Doh Soe Township are Yay Waing, Pa Ka Yi, A’Nya Hpya, Htee Ler Klay, Seik Chaung, Nyaung Chaung, Pa Hkaik, and Ya Ma Zu villages in Htee Ler Klay area; and Tha Yet Ngout, Leik Kyel Pyaung, Thin Kan Ton, Wa Kon, Taung Thon Lon, Kyauk Mel Taung, Shwe Chaung, Hindu Chaung, Hindar, Hindar Pyin and Yay Pu Wa villages in K’Moh Thway area., Access to information and communication services are very important because people need to contact each other when anything [incidents] happens in their area and they need to inform their relatives [by phone or via the internet]. They also need to share and receive updated information from each other [about military activity in other villages]. If fighting happens, they can flee or escape from the danger in advance if they know ahead of time, [as they can estimate] where and when the SAC will approach their area. They also need these services to contact [people, including friends from other villagers] for [to share] food [between each other]. According to local villagers, people from Pyin Tha Taw, Tha Phyu Chaung, Gin Tha Inn, Myin Hka Baw, Nyaung Ton, Thit Ket Chaung and Htan Ta Lon villages in K’Moh Thway area, Ler Doh Soe Township also did not have access to phone or internet connections., Due to phone and internet connections being cut while they were displaced, villagers from four villages (Pa Ka Yi, Yay Wine, A’Nya Pya and Htee Ler Klay villages) who fled from their villages on May 10th, and remained displaced until the end of May 2022, did not know whether other villagers or their houses were hit by the SAC shelling and whether villagers died or not due to the shelling. A grandmother from Htee Ler Klay area said, “We don’t know whether any villager from other villages died or not from the SAC shelling”., Between May 17th and 19th 2022, the phone and internet connection was restored in Htee Ler Klay and K’Moh Thway areas. However, on May 19th 2022, at 10:00 pm the internet and phone connection was cut off again. The internet [connection] was restored again at 1:00 am on May 20th. Then, it was cut off again in the afternoon. Between May 21st and 23rd 2022, the internet was completely cut off. Local villagers were really worried that the SAC would conduct air strikes when the phone and internet connection was cut. [The SAC frequently cuts off the internet in order to restrict communication between members of the opposition during air strikes and fighting.] It was cut off in a KNU-controlled area of Brigade 4 [Mergui-Tavoy District]. Villagers wonder and fear when the SAC will fire mortars. Villagers are mentally exhausted. They cannot live in peace., Shelling and a lack of communication services were the main challenges for civilians [in this reporting period] and they were frustrated with the situation. The situation was very terrifying. Villagers who live near the main road [between Htee Ler Klay area and Dawei Town] were afraid to stay in their houses because they were worried that they would be arrested to be used as porters and would be tortured by the SAC when the SAC were operating on the road. They [villagers] went to stay in the village monastery and their relatives’ houses nearby., Further background reading on the human rights situation in Mergui-Tavoy District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, “Mergui-Tavoy District Situation Update: Fighting and displacement, property damage, deaths caused by landmine explosion, travel restrictions, and the COVID-19 situation, December 2021 to February 2022”, June 2022., “Mergui-Tavoy District Situation Update: SAC militia shoots teenage villager, CDM and protester protection, SAC troop movement, arbitrary taxation and livelihood, healthcare and education challenges, March 2021”, January 2022., “Mergui-Tavoy District Situation Update: Attendance at KECD schools, the Civil Disobedience Movement, COVID-19 and the movement of SAC troops (March to June 2021)”, September 2021, Footnotes:, [1]The present document is based on information received in May 2022.

"Myanmar: No Justice, No Freedom for Rohingya 5 Years On [EN/AR/MY/ID]",News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,24 Aug 2022,"Anniversary of Atrocities Highlights International Inaction, (Bangkok) – Rohingya Muslims are still awaiting justice and protection of their rights five years after the Myanmar military began a sweeping campaign of massacres, rape, and arson in northern Rakhine State on August 25, 2017, Human Rights Watch said today. More than 730,000 Rohingya fled to precarious, flood-prone camps in Bangladesh, while about 600,000 remain under oppressive rule in Myanmar., No one has been held accountable for the crimes against humanity and acts of genocide committed against the Rohingya population. This anniversary should prompt concerned governments to take concrete action to hold the Myanmar military to account and secure justice and safety for the Rohingya in Bangladesh, Myanmar, and across the region., “Governments should mark the five-year anniversary of the devastating campaign against the Rohingya with a coordinated international strategy for accountability and justice that draws on Rohingya input,” said Elaine Pearson, acting Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Donors should support Rohingya refugees to study and work freely and safely so they can build independent and self-reliant futures.”, Since August 2017, Human Rights Watch has interviewed hundreds of Rohingya in Bangladesh who fled the Myanmar military’s atrocities. They described incidents in which soldiers systematically killed and raped villagers before torching their homes. Altogether, the security forces killed thousands and burned down nearly 400 villages. Those who escaped to neighboring Bangladesh joined a few hundred thousand refugees who had fled earlier waves of violence and persecution., “Myanmar authorities brutalized us,” said Abdul Halim, 30, a Rohingya refugee in Bangladesh. “They burned down our houses, raped our mothers and sisters, burned our children. We took shelter in Bangladesh to escape that brutality. Now I’ve been living in Kutupalong camp for five years.” Abdul carried his very ill mother on his back when they fled Myanmar in 2017. She died shortly after reaching Bangladesh., The Rohingya who remain in Rakhine State face systematic abuses that amount to the crimes against humanity of apartheid, persecution, and deprivation of liberty. They are confined to camps and villages without freedom of movement, cut off from access to adequate food, health care, education, and livelihoods., “Since we were children in Myanmar, we never had any freedom,” Abdul said. “They called me ‘nowa kalar’ [a slur for Muslims], to say we are like animals.”, Rohingya are effectively denied citizenship under Myanmar’s 1982 Citizenship Law, rendering them stateless. The 2017 atrocities were rooted in decades of state repression, discrimination, and violence., “In Myanmar, we struggled through life,” Hasina Hatu, 40, said. “When we raised goats, the border guard forces took away the goats. When we raised cattle, they took away the cattle. When we farmed paddy fields, they took away the rice.” Hasina’s father died after falling down a muddy slope as they fled in 2017., In February 2021, the generals who had orchestrated the atrocities against the Rohingya staged a coup and detained Myanmar’s elected civilian leaders. The military junta responded to mass demonstrations with a nationwide campaign of mass killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and indiscriminate attacks that amounted to crimes against humanity and, in conflict areas, war crimes. Military units that had been implicated in the 2017 atrocities – since sanctioned by the United States and United Kingdom – have been deployed in renewed operations around the country., The junta has imposed new movement restrictions and aid blockages on Rohingya camps and villages, increasing water scarcity and food shortages, along with disease and malnutrition. Since the coup, security forces have arrested an estimated 2,000 Rohingya, hundreds of them children, for “unauthorized travel.” Many have been sentenced to the maximum five years in prison. Increased fighting between the Myanmar military and ethnic Arakan Army has also left Rohingya caught in the middle., In Bangladesh, about one million Rohingya refugees live in sprawling, overcrowded camps in Cox’s Bazar and the isolated silt island of Bhasan Char. For five years, the Bangladesh government has respected the international principle of nonrefoulement, the right of refugees not to be returned to a country where their lives or freedom would be threatened., However, Bangladesh authorities have recently intensified restrictions on livelihoods, movement, and education that make many refugees feel unwelcome and at risk. Officials have closed community-led schools, arbitrarily destroyed shops, and imposed new obstacles on travel., “If our children can’t be educated here in Bangladesh either, then anywhere we go, we will still be persecuted,” Abdul said., Bangladesh authorities have moved about 28,000 Rohingya to Bhasan Char, where they face severe movement restrictions, food and medicine shortages, and abuses by security forces. Despite the involvement of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), many continue to be transferred without full, informed consent, and have been prevented from returning to the mainland. Bangladesh authorities should lift the new restrictions and end forced relocations of refugees, Human Rights Watch said., “How long will we live like this?” Hasina said. “I don’t think the world will solve our condition.”, The 2022 Joint Response Plan for the Rohingya humanitarian crisis has received only a quarter of its requested US$881 million in funding. Donors including the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, and Australia should increase funding to meet the massive needs of the refugee population to help Bangladesh support the Rohingya and host communities., The Bangladesh government and Myanmar junta have renewed discussions around repatriation, announcing in January joint plans to “expeditiously complete the verification process.” Two prior repatriation attempts failed, with Rohingya refugees unwilling to return due to the ongoing persecution and abuse in Myanmar. Michelle Bachelet, the outgoing UN high commissioner for human rights, announced on August 17, following a visit to Cox’s Bazar, that “the current situation across the border means that conditions are not right for returns.”, “We want to go back to Myanmar but to go there we want justice,” Mohammad Ayaz, 21, said. “How long will we have to live in a tarpaulin house? It’s been five years. Who knows how long we have to live here. Who knows whether the world will help us get justice or not.” Mohammad was shot while fleeing his village of Tula Toli on August 30, 2017. At least 12 members of his family, including his parents and sisters, were killed., In Malaysia, India, and Thailand, thousands of Rohingya refugees are being held indefinitely in immigration detention sites or living without adequate support and protection., The international response to the 2017 violence was fragmented and halting, with governments favoring quiet diplomacy that achieved little over strategic measures to place real pressure on the military, Human Rights Watch said., Building conditions for the voluntary, safe, and dignified return of Rohingya refugees will require a cohesive international response to establish rights-respecting rule in Myanmar and achieve justice for the crimes in Rakhine State. A future Myanmar under democratic civilian rule will entail full citizenship rights for Rohingya and reparations for the atrocities, including for stolen or destroyed land and property., The UN Security Council should end its inaction borne of anticipated vetoes by China and Russia and urgently negotiate a resolution to institute a global arms embargo on Myanmar, refer the situation to the International Criminal Court, and impose targeted sanctions on the junta and military-owned conglomerates., “What are we waiting for?” a US diplomat said in a speech at a Security Council meeting in 2021. “The longer we delay, the more people die. This council is failing in our collective responsibility to safeguard international peace and security. And it is failing the people of Burma.”, The US, UK, EU, and other governments should together strengthen international sanctions to cut off the Myanmar military from the revenue funding its abusive operations, including in Rakhine State. Governments should target the junta’s gas revenues, its largest source of foreign income, totaling about $1 billion in annual profits. The EU sanctioned the junta-controlled Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise in February, but other governments have so far failed to follow suit. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should urgently abandon its failed five-point consensus response to the crisis and instead coordinate strong action against the junta’s abuses., “We hope that, with help from foreign governments and Bangladesh, we will be able to get back our rights,” Abdul said. “That is what we want.”, Governments should explore every avenue for justice and accountability for the Myanmar military’s atrocity crimes, including by formally supporting the case under the Genocide Convention brought by Gambia against Myanmar before the International Court of Justice. Canada and the Netherlands have publicly declared their intention to support the proceedings., Governments should also actively pursue investigations and prosecutions under the principle of universal jurisdiction, an avenue to justice for crimes so serious that all states have an interest in addressing them. The Argentine judiciary has opened an investigation into Myanmar’s atrocities against the Rohingya under universal jurisdiction., “The Myanmar junta’s killing of demonstrators, shelling of civilians, and other abuses reflect in large measure the failure to hold the generals accountable for their atrocities of five years ago,” Pearson said. “Influential governments should overcome their past mistakes and take strong measures to sever the flow of arms and revenue underwriting the junta’s ongoing crimes.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-no-justice-no-freedom-rohingya-5-years-enarmyid
"Dooplaya District Incident Report: SAC shot at villagers, resulting in the death of two villagers in Kaw T’Ree Township, April 2022",Situation Report,KHRG,Protection and Human Rights,23 Aug 2022,"This Incident Report describes events that occurred in Kaw T’Ree (Kawkareik) Township, Dooplaya District in April 2022, including the arbitrary killing of two civilians by the State Administration Council (SAC) and the displacement of villagers. Villagers from Maw Hpoh Kloh village were returning to their displacement site when they were shot at by SAC soldiers. One villager was shot in the chest twice and died immediately. Another villager was injured by a bullet to the stomach, but died shortly afterward because the SAC soldiers took the bodies of the victims and prevented the injured villager from being able to receive medical treatment.

Please use the space prepared below, and create an attachment if needed., On April 8th 2022, two villagers from Maw Hpoh Kloh village, Maw Hkee village tract were shot by the State Administration Council (SAC)[3] in Kwee Hser Hpaw village, Maw Hkee village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township. One died immediately; the other died as a result of being denied medical care. Local villagers do not know which SAC group is responsible because the troops had recently rotated. According to Karen Information Center (KIC), the soldiers were from SAC Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[4] #560, 561, 585 and 559, led by Commander Myint Kyaw.[5], [On March 21st 2022, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[6] attacked the SAC camp in Maw Hkee village.] Villagers in Maw Hpoh Kloh and Maw Hkee fled before the SAC camp was attacked by the KNLA [on March 21st 2022]. [The SAC retaliated and re-occupied the camp on April 6th 2022]. Villagers heard [were informed by the KNLA] that the SAC were going to attack the camp prior to the re-occupation on April 6th, and also saw SAC troop reinforcement and increased SAC activity in the village. [Therefore, villagers who had previously displaced knew not to return to the village. Those who had previously chosen to remain in the village knew to displace to other areas.] Some villagers in Maw Hpoh Kloh sought shelter nearby in Kwee Hser Hpaw village [Maw Hkee village tract]., Two Maw Hpoh Kloh villagers [Baw Hkaw, aged around 50 years old, and his nephew, Saw Ta Thoo, aged around 32 years old] were among the displaced and had been staying in Kwee Hser Hpaw village for a while. On the day of the incident, they had travelled back home to Maw Hpoh Kloh village with a tractor to collect coconuts and bananas to make a sacrifice [as part of a Buddhist practice]. Some other female villagers including their wives and children also went with them. After collecting the fruit, they returned to Kwee Hser Hpaw village. Meanwhile, around 30 SAC soldiers arrived at the village [Kwee Hser Hpaw] ahead of them [and were stationed at the entrance of the village, where they could see traffic entering and leaving]. When the villagers arrived at the entrance of the village at around 10:30 am, two KNLA soldiers passed them on a motorbike. When the SAC soldiers saw them [the vehicles on the road], they fired their guns, hitting two civilians. [Although the SAC may have been shooting at the KNLA, given the nature of the wounds (see below), it is likely that the SAC also intentionally shot at the civilians.], One of the victims, Saw Ta Thoo, was driving the tractor and his wife and other villagers [including Saw Baw Hkaw] were in the [back of the] tractor [where the load is usually carried]. Two men in the tractor were hit by the bullets from the SAC soldiers, Saw Ta Thoo and Saw Baw Hkaw. Saw Ta Thoo died straight away as he was shot twice in the chest. He fell from the tractor as he was driving. Then, the tractor hit a tree and stopped. His wife went down from the tractor and called to him but he was not alive anymore. The other victim, the uncle [Saw Baw Hkaw], was shot once in his stomach but he did not die right away. The villagers in Kwee Hser Hpaw watched the SAC move the bodies away from the site of the incident [so that the villagers could not retrieve them]. Saw Baw Hkaw was still alive., Saw H--- [who witnessed the incident] requested that the SAC give the injured villager, Saw Baw Hkaw, back to the villagers as he was still alive. Saw H--- was hoping to send Saw Baw Hkaw to a hospital across the border in Thailand, to be able to save him. However, the SAC did not allow him to do so. None of the villagers dared to complain about this as they were terrified by the scene made by the SAC soldiers. Saw Baw Hkaw died after a moment [around one hour after he was shot]. Villagers told the SAC soldiers that the two dead men were just normal villagers and requested [that the SAC soldiers return the bodies so that they could] bury the corpses. The SAC soldiers gave the corpses of the two villagers back to the family, and they were buried at their homes after the SAC soldiers had left the village [the same day as the incident]., Both victims were married. They were both from Maw Hpoh Kloh village. Saw Ta Thoo is survived by his wife (who was seven months pregnant at the time of reporting) and a 7-year-old daughter. Saw Baw Hkaw is survived by his wife and three daughters. Saw Baw Hkaw’s oldest daughter is 10 years old. The families have to rely on their relatives to survive. [They did not receive compensation.], The villagers who witnessed this incident recalled that fighting occurred between the SAC and KNLA in Kwee Hser Hpaw village [where Maw Hpoh Kloh villagers had fled due to fighting and military activities in their own village] shortly after the incident. Prior to this fighting, the SAC stopped villagers who travelled on the road and kept them among the soldiers. [These villagers were likely used as human shields during the fighting.] During the fighting, the SAC fired a few mortars [the specific number is unknown] into Kwee Hser Hpaw village., Although fighting was frequent in the area around Maw Hkee village [since March 2022], some male villagers still managed to live in the village, whereas their families fled to other villages. After this killing incident, most of the remaining villagers from Maw Hkee village tract fled to the Thai border as they were highly concerned for their safety. [This is the first time a villager had been shot dead in the village since the coup.] Some villagers from Maw Hpoh Kloh fled to K--- village [a Thai-Karen village] in Thailand., There are around 67 households in Maw Hpoh Kloh village and more than 10 households in Kwee Hser Hpaw village. [The number of households in Maw Hkee village is unknown.] Most households in these three villages have now fled. Villagers left their livestock, stocks of rice and household materials, when they displaced. Villagers in Maw Hkee village tract have faced around two months of displacement. Sometimes, displaced villagers sneak back into the village to take some of their paddy to their displacement site. However, it is dangerous because the SAC often patrol the village and fighting can happen at any time between the SAC and the local Karen armed groups (KNLA, Democratic Karen Benevolent Army (DKBA)[7] and Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO)[8])., Part 4 - Permission for Using the Details, Did the victim(s) provide permission to use this information?

The chairperson serves as the de facto head of government of Burma/Myanmar and leads the Military Cabinet of Myanmar, the executive branch of the government. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of SAC chairperson following the coup., [4] A Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) comprises 500 soldiers. Most Light Infantry Battalions in the Tatmadaw are under-strength with less than 200 soldiers, yet up-to-date information regarding the size of battalions is hard to come by, particularly following the signing of the NCA. LIBs are primarily used for offensive operations, but they are
sometimes used for garrison duties., [5] This information was taken from the Karen Information Centre (KIC) facebook page, from a post dated April 8th 2021., [6] The Karen National Liberation Army is the armed wing of the Karen National Union., [7] In 1994, the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA) split from the KNLA over religious considerations.

"Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: Killing, torture and use of human shields and navigators by the SAC and BGF in Bilin Township, May to June 2022",Situation Report,KHRG,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",22 Aug 2022,"This Short Update describes events that occurred in Bilin Township, Doo Tha Htoo (Thaton) District during the period between May and the first week of June 2022. It covers activities of the State Administration Council (SAC) Infantry Battalion (IB) #403 under Military Operation Command (MOC) #8 and Border Guard Force (BGF) Battalion #1011 in the area between Meh Pree and Na Kyee army camps. The SAC and BGF troops committed human rights violations including the arrest of local villagers for use as human shields, torture and killing. SAC and BGF troop movement caused fighting and the local Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO) planted landmines to defend their territory. Two of the landmines exploded, killing a villager’s goats. The villager relies on these goats for the family’s livelihood.[1], Since the coup, State Administration Council (SAC)[2] troops under Military Operations Command (MOC)[3] #8[4] and Border Guard Force (BGF)[5] Battalion #1011 [formerly Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA)[6] Battalion #333] in Na Kyee and Meh Pree army camps, Bilin Township, Doo Tha Htoo (Thaton) District, have increased military activity and movement between their army camps. During patrols, these SAC and BGF troops passed villages including Aee Soo Hkee, Kloo Htaw Law (Kwee Htaw Law) and Wah K’Teh villages in Aee Soo Hkee village tract[7], and Wah Hkaw Pwa, K’Hser Hpoe and Meh Pree Hkee villages in Meh Pree Hkee village tract, in Bilin Township. Moreover, fighting sometimes broke out close to the villages when the SAC and BGF encountered local troops from the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO)[8]. Sometimes the local KNDO troop attacked them, while these SAC and BGF troops patrolled Karen National Union (KNU)[9]-controlled territory. During fighting, the SAC and BGF frequently conducted indiscriminate shelling close to villages. This shelling placed villagers’ lives at high risk and destroyed livestock and property. [Details of the fighting and shelling cannot be confirmed.], As a result of the fighting and the SAC and BGF activities during the period between the beginning of May and June 3rd 2022, villagers were in danger of being hit by bullets and shrapnel, arrested for portering, used as human shields, as well as tortured and killed., Killing, On about May 10th 2022 [the specific date cannot be determined], SAC troops [unknown battalion number] under MOC #8 and BGF troops from Battalion #1011, led by Battalion Deputy Commander Hennery, transported one of their injured soldiers from Meh Pree army camp to Na Kyee army camp for treatment. They stopped at Na Kyee army camp for about one week and then returned to Aee Soo Hkee army camp on May 18th 2022. When they arrived at W--- village, Aee Soo Hkee village tract [on their return to Aee Soo Hkee army camp on May 18th,] they shot at a villager [and a KNDO soldier] beside the village. Both died [immediately from the shooting]., The incident happened when the villager was going to buy food. The KNDO soldier had ordered him to buy food for the local KNDO troops. The villager and KNDO soldier had planned to meet along a path beside the village to exchange the food. The SAC and BGF shot them dead [as soon as they arrived at the meeting place]. Therefore, [villagers suspect that the] BGF and SAC were waiting [in secret] to shoot at them [the villager and KNDO soldier] beside the path since before they arrived. Then, the SAC and BGF troops headed back to Aee Soo Hkee army camp. During the night, other SAC and BGF troops [unknown battalions] passed through Kwee Htaw Law village from Aee Soo Hkee army camp back to Na Kyee army camp, which created a high security risk for civilians. The victims’ family could only get the corpses for the funeral the following day on May 19th 2022, after the local KNDO troop had made sure that there were no landmines around the incident place., The name of the [civilian] victim is Saw[10] H---. He was 34 years old and leaves behind his five young children and his wife. Saw H--- had three sons and two daughters, and his youngest child is only around one year old. As he [Saw H---] was the only breadwinner for his family, it is a big loss for their family’s wellbeing and livelihood. His widow is now deeply concerned about the future education, wellbeing and livelihood of her five children. Even though her four older children could go to school last year, it is uncertain if they will be able to go to school this year or in the future. A family member expressed that, “Everything is a challenge for her [the victim’s wife] because she lost the breadwinner of the family. How can she raise the group of children without her husband? […] Now his children and wife are crying a lot and we cannot do anything now.” Villagers and village leaders from Aee Soo Hkee village tract provided 100,000 kyats [USD 54.01][11] to the victim’s family, but they have not received any compensation or support from any authorities or armed groups., Use of human shields, Whenever the SAC and BGF who are based in Na Kyee and Meh Pree army camps patrolled the area between their army camps, they arrested any villagers they saw on their way to use as navigators and human shields. On May 3rd 2022, the SAC Infantry Battalion (IB)[12] #403[13] and BGF Battalion #1011 arrested a number of villagers [the total number cannot be confirmed] as human shields, including four villagers from Aee Soo Hkee village and four villagers from Wah K’Teh village, and released those villagers when they arrived at the next place [the exact location cannot be confirmed]., Physical assault, Moreover, one villager named Saw L--- from B--- village, was also physically assaulted by being slapped across the face while standing beside his house, without being given a reason. Saw L---’s face became swollen and it was painful. The incident happened in the afternoon of May 3rd 2022, and was perpetrated by a soldier from SAC Infantry Battalion (IB) #403 under MOC #8 and BGF Battalion #1011 under Bo[14] Henry, when the troops arrived at B--- village while patrolling between Meh Pree army camp and Na Kyee army camp., Landmine incident, In May 2022 [specific dates are unknown], two landmine incidents happened near Kwee Htaw Law village, Aee Soo Hkee village tract, Bilin Township. The exploded landmines were planted by a local KNDO battalion, to defend their territory following fighting with the SAC and BGF. One of the incidents happened in a place just outside of Kwee Htaw Law village and the explosion killed three goats. The other landmine exploded in Chaw K’Lee Hta area, beside the Bu Law Kloe River and the explosion killed seven goats. The 10 goats were all owned by one villager from Kwee Htaw Law village. Moreover, the presence of landmines near the community farms [located outside of the villages] also created a high security risk for the nearby villagers [who had to travel to and work on their farms]., From early June 2022, the SAC and BGF stopped patrolling the area between their army camps, so the situation in Aee Soo Hkee village went back to normal and villagers did not have to face armed conflict, arrest, torture and the fear of human rights violations by armed actors. Therefore, villagers are now preparing their farms to start planting paddy for their livelihoods. However, fighting can happen when the SAC and BGF resume their troop movements. Just recently, villagers received information about the SAC and BGF resuming their military activities. So once again they fear conflict and other abuses so need to be cautious., Further background reading on human rights violations in Doo Tha Htoo District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in June 2022. It was provided by a community member in Doo Tha Htoo District who has been trained by KHRG to monitor human rights conditions on the ground.

The chairperson serves as the de facto head of government of Burma/Myanmar and leads the Military Cabinet of Myanmar, the executive branch of the government. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of SAC chairperson following the coup., [3] Military Operations Command (MOC) is comprised of ten battalions for offensive operations. Most MOCs have three Tactical Operations Commands (TOCs) made up of three battalions each., [4] This information was taken from the KNU Doo Tha Htoo News Facebook page, from a post dated May 5th 2022., [5] Border Guard Force (BGF) battalions of the Tatmadaw were established in 2010, and they are composed mostly of soldiers from former non-state armed groups, such as older constellations of the DKBA, which have formalised ceasefire agreements with the Burma/Myanmar government and agreed to transform into battalions within the Tatmadaw., [6] The Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA) was originally formed in 1994 as a breakaway group from the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). Since its separation from the KNLA in 1994, it was known to frequently cooperate with and support the Tatmadaw in its conflict with the KNLA. The original group underwent major change in 2010 as the majority of the original DKBA was transformed into the Border Guard Force (BGF), under the control of the Burma/Myanmar government., [7] A village tract is an administrative unit of between five and 20 villages in a local area, often centred on a large
village., [8] The Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO) was formed in 1947 by the Karen National Union and is the precursor to the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). Today the KNDO refers to a militia force of local volunteers trained and equipped by the KNLA and incorporated into its battalion and command structure; its members wear uniforms and typically commit to two-year terms of service., [9] The Karen National Union (KNU) is the main Karen political organisation. It was established in 1947 and has been in conflict with the Burma/Myanmar government since 1949. The KNU wields power across large areas of Southeast Burma and has been calling for the creation of a democratic federal system since 1976. Although it signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement in 2015, relations with the government remain tense., [10] Saw is a S’gaw Karen male honorific title used before a person’s name., [11] All conversion estimates for the kyat are based on the July 5th 2022 mid-market exchange rate of 1,000 kyats to USD 0.54 (taken from https://wise.com/gb/currency-converter/mmk-to-usd-rate)., [12] An Infantry Battalion (IB) comprises 500 soldiers. However, most Infantry Battalions in the Tatmadaw are under-strength with less than 200 soldiers.

Resilient humanitarian workers redouble efforts to support communities in Myanmar [EN/MY],News and Press Release,UNCT Myanmar,"Protection and Human Rights
Safety and Security",19 Aug 2022,"“The world shouldn’t forget Myanmar.”, All names in this story have been changed to protect confidentiality., “The painful situation that I see our children in pushes me to work even harder,” said Shar Myar, * a humanitarian worker with an international organisation working in Myanmar., Since the military takeover in Myanmar on 1 February 2021, hundreds of children have been abducted, recruited into armies, arrested, and killed by landmines or artillery. Many have no access to basic social services, and millions need humanitarian assistance. Yet international agencies are staying on the ground, working with national organizations to deliver much-needed assistance., Shar Myar, who is from Myanmar and whose job is to monitor and report incidents of grave violations against children and link the children and families with response and support services, recently helped secure the release of two abducted children. As they have done for thousands of other children, her organisation supported them with health care, food, cash support and mental health counselling., Yet other cases end tragically., Shar Myar mentioned the case of four abducted boys, who were found dead in a pit latrine. “I can’t even find the words to express how I felt,” she said., The military takeover came on top of the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and exacerbated protracted conflicts already ongoing in many parts of the country., About 14.4 million people are now in need of humanitarian assistance in Myanmar in a country of about 55 million, according to UN data. Moreover, most states and regions are contaminated with landmines, making Myanmar one of the world’s most mine-affected countries., Finding ways to cope, Most aid workers in Myanmar have been personally affected., While on a short stay in her home state of Kayah, Shar Myar had to flee with her family. She now lives with seven members of her extended family in Yangon, in a small apartment. She has recently learned her family’s house in Kayah was burnt down., Kyaw Moe*, who works for another humanitarian organisation in Shan State, was in the office when he heard about the sudden military takeover. “It reminded me of the past,” he said. “I was scared for my country. I was so depressed that for the first week I found it difficult to get out of bed.”, Another humanitarian worker, Aung Tun*, said that talking with children and families since the military takeover has been challenging., “I found it traumatising. I couldn’t sleep,” he said. “But I had to toughen up.”, Aung Tun said he practises meditation and encourages his friends, particularly his male friends who are not used to seeking mental health support, to ask for help., New ways of operation, Most aid and civil society organisations have had to find innovative ways to help affected people. Many staff of Myanmar origin find it hard to believe how the nature of their work has changed so quickly., Kyaw Moe used to work with the government. Now, much of his work is managing humanitarian assistance and addressing human rights violations, including organizing legal aid support., Security challenges and restricted access have hampered the provision of humanitarian assistance., However, this year, some humanitarian access has been granted, particularly to provide supplies and services for children and families living in towns., Aung Tun recently visited Kachin State, bordering China. Young people there - most of whom had to drop out of school or university – now take part in activities, including vocational training., While Aung Tun witnessed the positive impact of the activities, he also felt the pain that the young people had experienced. “They are only a few years younger than me,” he said. “They feel their future has been thrown away. I could see it in their eyes.”, And Aung Tun talked on behalf of all humanitarian workers when he said, “The world shouldn’t forget Myanmar.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/resilient-humanitarian-workers-redouble-efforts-support-communities-myanmar-enmy
"Statement by the Humanitarian Coordinator a.i, Mr. Ramanathan Balakrishnan, on the occasion of World Humanitarian Day [EN/MY]",News and Press Release,UN RC/HC Myanmar,"Protection and Human Rights
Safety and Security",19 Aug 2022,"Yangon – On World Humanitarian Day 2022, I want to pay tribute to the dedicated aid workers of Myanmar who are risking their lives to deliver vital assistance to communities in need every day, and also remember those who have died or been injured in the course of their work., I want to use this occasion to call for an end to the unrelenting violence that is terrifying communities and making these brave humanitarian efforts necessary. Civilians should never be a target and humanitarian workers in Myanmar must be allowed to do their jobs free from restrictions and harassment, in line with all the protections afforded to them under international law., It takes a “humanitarian village” to help a community in crisis and the UN, International NGOs and the Red Cross family stand in solidarity with the growing network of local responders who have stepped up to help their own communities and are now the backbone of the Myanmar response. I applaud their tireless commitment to finding new ways of reducing suffering in the face of daily horrors., Never has this work been more important with conflict raging, 1.2 million people now displaced, and poverty and inflation surging. A massive national effort is underway to reach more than 6 million crisis-affected people with assistance before the end of the year and we are half-way to this annual goal despite severe access constraints., The humanitarian community has stayed and delivered, working with local partners to expand our operations on an unprecedented scale. With generous funding from donors, local, national and international humanitarian organizations reached more than 3 million people with assistance in the first half of 2022, but there is still a long way to go., This effort will require improved access to people in need, relief from debilitating bureaucratic constraints and a dramatic scale-up in donor support. Expanded humanitarian access, especially to conflict-affected areas, is vital and negotiations to secure this access should never be politicized or made transactional., The 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan is just 17 per cent funded, 8 months into the year. More resources are desperately needed for us to continue our life-saving work and avoid heart-wrenching decisions about who we cannot help., On World Humanitarian Day, we urge the international donor community to again step-up in these difficult times and give generously in solidarity with the people of Myanmar, supporting the country’s “humanitarian village” to save lives and reduce suffering., Background, On 19 August 2003, a bomb attack on the Canal Hotel in Baghdad, Iraq, killed 22 humanitarian aid workers, including the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello. Five years later, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution designating 19 August as World Humanitarian Day. Each year, World Humanitarian Day focuses on a theme, bringing together partners from across the humanitarian system to advocate for the survival, well-being and dignity of people affected by crises, and for the safety and security of aid workers.

"In first meeting in Nay Pyi Taw, Special Envoy Heyzer states steps State Administration Council must take to de-escalate conflict and reduce suffering of Myanmar people",News and Press Release,UN DPPA,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",17 Aug 2022,"NAY PYI TAW, 17 August 2022 – Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Myanmar Noeleen Heyzer met withState Administration Council (SAC) Chairman Senior General Min Aung Hlaing in Nay Pyi Taw today, in her first visit to Myanmar as Special Envoy, to communicate in person the pragmatic steps to de-escalate the violence,address the multidimensional crisis and advance unfettered humanitarian assistance free of discrimination to allpeople in need., The Special Envoy’s meeting with the Senior General and his senior advisers is part of broader efforts by the United Nations to urgently support an effective and peaceful Myanmar-led political pathway to return to civilian rule based on the will and the needs of the people. The Special Envoy’s mandate as an impartial actor is to engage with all stakeholders in Myanmar, the region and globally consistent with the principles of the United Nations. The Special Envoy’s visit follows her extensive consultations with actors from across the political spectrum, civil society and as communities affected by the conflict., “The United Nations Secretary-General is extremely concerned about the gravity of the humanitarian, security, economic and political crisis,” Special Envoy Heyzer said. “My visit is to convey the concern of the United Nations and propose concrete steps needed to reduce the conflict and suffering of the people. UN engagement does not in any way confer legitimacy. The people of Myanmar have the right to democracy and self-determination free from fear and want, which will only be possible by the good will and efforts of all stakeholders in an inclusive process.” She added that the United Nations was focused on providing support to women in Myanmar, the protection and empowerment of whom is key to achieving peace and any economic and social transformation., The Special Envoy stated that any progress in Myanmar depended on an end to the violence and visible and significant improvements in the lives of people on the ground. Following the recent death sentences carried out against pro-democracy activists that the United Nations has strongly condemned, the Special Envoy directly urgedthe Senior General to impose a moratorium on all future executions. She also reiterated the United NationsSecretary-General’s call for the release of all political prisoners., “I urged the SAC to implement the Secretary-General’s appeal,” the Special Envoy said. “I also conveyed a specific request from the Australian Government that has asked for the release of Australian economist Sean Turnell. Personally, I call for the release of all children who are being detained in prisons or other facilities.”, The Special Envoy amplified the latest call from the Security Council for an immediate cessation of all forms of violence, full respect for human rights and the rule of law, and full, safe and unfettered humanitarian access to all those in need. She called for immediate and specific de-escalation steps including ending aerial bombing and the burning of civilian houses and infrastructure., The Special Envoy stated her deep concern about civilian displacement across communities and the need for greater space for humanitarian actors to reach those affected with lifesaving support. She underlined that all parties must facilitate the unimpeded and immediate delivery of humanitarian assistance to all people in need without discrimination and free from instrumentalization. She highlighted the importance of delivery through all channels and raised the issue of an inclusive forum for humanitarian engagement, which several key ethnic armed organizations and other actors have asked her to establish, focusing on the emergency that is a direct result of the political crisis., The Special Envoy raised her request for a meeting with State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi following her latest sentencing. “I’m deeply concerned about Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s health and well- being in her current situation, and request that she can return home soon,” Special Envoy Heyzer said. “I want to have an opportunity to meet with her as soon as possible, both because I care about her personally and I believe she is acritical stakeholder for my dialogue with all parties concerned.”, Ahead of her mission to Bangladesh later this month, the Special Envoy told the Senior General she plans to consult with the Government and visit the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazaar that host about 1 million Rohingya and other forcibly displaced people. She highlighted Myanmar’s responsibility for conducive conditions for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of refugees as well as to ensure that the Rohingya’s rights and well-being are integral to the future of a peaceful and prosperous Myanmar., The Special Envoy presented the Senior General with a copy of the UN Charter, on which the ASEAN Charter is based, and emphasized that sovereignty must come with development for all, leaving no one behind, and the promise that every individual in every country has an equal claim to dignity, respect and freedom from want or fear. The UN Charter is the foundation of the rule-based world order, the Special Envoy told the Senior General, adding that these norms and standards must be met if peace and stability are to be achieved., The Special Envoy emphasized the strong commitment of the United Nations to continue making all efforts to provide humanitarian assistance and community-based resilience support and protection services to people in need, guided by the internationally recognized principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence, and asked the Senior General to respect and support these efforts. She highlighted her continued resolve to act in a bridging role and leverage her convening power to address the protection needs and suffering of the most vulnerable and to end the conflict., Going forward, the Special Envoy and the Senior General agreed to engage in frank conversations, focusing on the need for inclusive solutions to a peaceful and democratic Myanmar, reflective of the will of the people., Jeremy Walden-Schertz, Media and Communications Officer, jeremy.walden-schertz@un.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/first-meeting-nay-pyi-taw-special-envoy-heyzer-states-steps-state-administration-council-must-take-de-escalate-conflict-and-reduce-suffering-myanmar-people

"Evidence of crimes against humanity in Myanmar escalates, with women and children severely impacted, according to Myanmar Mechanism Annual Report",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,9 Aug 2022,"Geneva, 9 August 2022 – Crimes against humanity continue to be systematically committed in Myanmar, with ongoing conflicts severely impacting women and children, according to the evidence gathered to date by the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (Mechanism) and outlined in its Annual Report released today., The Mechanism has collected more than three million information items from almost 200 sources since starting operations three years ago, the Report notes. This includes interview statements, documentation, videos, photographs, geospatial imagery and social media material. The available information indicates that sexual and gender-based crimes, including rape and other forms of sexual violence, and crimes against children have been perpetrated by members of the security forces and armed groups. According to the Report, children in Myanmar have been tortured, conscripted and arbitrarily detained, including as proxies for their parents., “Crimes against women and children are amongst the gravest international crimes, but they are also historically underreported and under-investigated,” said Nicholas Koumjian, Head of the Mechanism. “Our team has dedicated expertise to ensure targeted outreach and investigations so that these crimes can ultimately be prosecuted. Perpetrators of these crimes need to know that they cannot continue to act with impunity. We are collecting and preserving the evidence so that they will one day be held to account.”, According to the Report, “there are ample indications that since the military takeover in February 2021, crimes have been committed in Myanmar on a scale and in a manner that constitutes a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population” and the nature of potential criminality is also expanding. This includes the execution of four individuals by Myanmar’s military on 25 July 2022, which was carried out after the Report was prepared., The Report is released just two weeks ahead of the five-year commemoration of clearance operations which resulted in the displacement of nearly one million Rohingya people. Most of the Rohingya who were deported or forcibly displaced at that time are still in camps for refugees or internally displaced persons., “While the Rohingya consistently express their desire for a safe and dignified return to Myanmar, this will be very difficult to achieve unless there is accountability for the atrocities committed against them, including through prosecutions of the individuals most responsible for those crimes,” said Koumjian. “The continued plight of the Rohingya and the continuing violence in Myanmar illustrate the important role of the Mechanism to facilitate justice and accountability and help deter further atrocities.”, With the consent of its sources of information, the Mechanism is sharing relevant evidence to support international justice proceedings currently underway at the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court., The Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM or Mechanism) was created by the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2018 to collect and analyse evidence of the most serious international crimes and other violations of international law committed in Myanmar since 2011. It aims to facilitate justice and accountability by preserving and organizing this evidence and preparing case files for use in future prosecutions of those responsible in national, regional and international courts., For more information visit https://iimm.un.org/ or contact iimm@un.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/evidence-crimes-against-humanity-myanmar-escalates-women-and-children-severely-impacted-according-myanmar-mechanism-annual-report
"Atrocity Alert No. 312: Myanmar (Burma), Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory and DR Congo",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,10 Aug 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., NEW REPORTS REVEAL EVIDENCE OF ATROCITIES IN MYANMAR, Crimes against humanity continue to be systematically committed in Myanmar (Burma), according to a report released by the UN’s International Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (IIMM) on 9 August. Violent conflict -which has engulfed Myanmar since the military launched a coup in February 2021 – is disproportionately affecting women and children. The IIMM documented evidence of sexual and gender-based crimes, including rape and other forms of sexual violence, as well as crimes against children perpetrated by members of the security forces and armed groups. Children in Myanmar have also been tortured, conscripted and arbitrarily detained, including as proxies for their parents., “Crimes against women and children are amongst the gravest international crimes, but they are also historically underreported and under-investigated,” Nicholas Koumjian, Head of the IIMM, said in a press release. “Perpetrators of these crimes need to know that they cannot continue to act with impunity. We are collecting and preserving the evidence so that they will one day be held to account.”, The IIMM’s report was released two weeks before the five-year anniversary of the so-called “clearance operations” by the military against the Rohingya, a distinct Muslim ethnic minority, in Rakhine State. The operations were characterized by brutal violence and grave human rights violations on a mass scale. As a result, over 700,000 Rohingya were forced to flee to Bangladesh. Severe violations of universal human rights and the risk of atrocity crimes persists for the Rohingya population remaining in Myanmar as the military continues to perpetrate widespread and systematic human rights violations and abuses against civilians, particularly those from ethnic minority populations., On 4 August Reuters released an investigative report based on a cache of thousands of official documents that provides significant insight into how Myanmar’s military planned the Rohingya genocide. The documents, collected by the Commission for International Justice and Accountability, reveal discussions and planning by senior military officials weeks before the “clearance operations” began, as well as their efforts to hide the operations from the international community., Liam Scott, Myanmar Expert at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said, “these reports clearly show that the previous government of Myanmar and the military systematically targeted populations within their borders, and that the military junta continues to do so. Based on the growing evidence of past and ongoing atrocity crimes, the UN Security Council should urgently refer the situation to the International Criminal Court and impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Myanmar. Moreover, additional states should formally intervene in The Gambia v. Myanmar Rohingya genocide case at the International Court of Justice.”, INDISCRIMINATE ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES ON GAZA CAUSE SCORES OF CIVILIAN CASUALTIES, At least 46 Palestinians, including 16 children, have been killed and over 360 wounded after three days of indiscriminate Israeli airstrikes on Gaza from 5-7 August. According to Palestinian officials, almost half of the Palestinians killed were civilians. Israeli forces launched this series of airstrikes throughout the Gaza Strip, including Gaza city, Beit Hanoun and Khan Younis, as part of an operation that it characterized as a “preemptive” act of self-defense. The airstrikes also destroyed residential buildings. In retaliation, rockets were fired from several locations in Gaza towards Israel, injuring dozens of civilians and damaging some civilian structures. The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Francesca Albanese, said the airstrikes on the Gaza Strip “not only are illegal but irresponsible.”, Prior to this escalation, tensions were high after as Israeli forces arrested a senior operative of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) armed group in Jenin in the occupied West Bank on 2 August. Following the arrest, the PIJ leadership issued a statement, claiming it would “respond to any aggression.” That same day, Israeli authorities imposed a closure of its crossings with Gaza, prohibiting people and essential commodities – including food and fuel – from entering or leaving. On 7 August the Israeli government and the PIJ reached a truce, brokered by Egypt. Tor Wennesland, Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, described the ceasefire as “fragile,” stressing that, “any resumption of hostilities will only have devastating consequences.”, The deadly airstrikes between 5-7 August marked the worst outbreak of fighting since May 2021, when Israeli airstrikes killed and injured over 2,170 Palestinians in Gaza and rocket fire by Hamas killed at least 12 Israelis. Indiscriminate attacks have frequently occurred throughout Israel’s air, sea and land blockade of the Gaza Strip, that for the past 15 years has inflicted collective punishment on the more than 2 million Palestinians trapped there. Escalations in fighting have exacerbated the already dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza where there are frequent shortages of potable water, food, medicine and other essential goods due to Israeli restrictions. As a result of Israel’s closure of the crossings into Gaza, on 6 August the Gaza Power Plant shut down for two days, causing drastic cuts to electricity supplies., Israel’s continued occupation of Palestinian territory, as well as crimes against humanity, including apartheid and the persecution of Palestinians, has led to recurrent conflict and violations. Israeli authorities must cease its collective punishment of Palestinians and lift its blockade of the Gaza Strip. All violations of International Humanitarian Law should be investigated and perpetrators held accountable., ARMED GROUPS TERRORIZING COMMUNITIES IN EASTERN DR CONGO, From 5-6 August alleged fighters from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) armed group killed at least 15 civilians during two separate attacks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s (DRC) eastern Ituri province. The military governor of Ituri said that the ADF targeted Kandoyi and Bandiboli villages in Irumu territory, where houses were also burned down during the deadly raids. The ADF has perpetrated recurrent atrocities and retaliatory attacks against civilians in Irumu and Mambasa territories of Ituri, as well as in villages surrounding Beni, North Kivu province, killing at least 1,500 civilians since January 2021., The latest ADF attacks come as the security situation in eastern DRC has deteriorated. According to the UN Refugee Agency, “strings of coordinated attacks by multiple militia groups are terrorizing communities on a daily basis in the eastern provinces.” The volume of attacks is straining the capacity of the government’s armed forces (FARDC) and the UN peacekeeping operation in the DRC (MONUSCO) to provide adequate protection to populations. In particular, the redeployment of the FARDC to fight against the March 23 Movement (M23) armed group has created power vacuums and a fragile security environment, leaving civilians more vulnerable to attacks by groups like the ADF., Populations in Rutshuru and Nyiragongo territories, North Kivu, are also at heightened risk of atrocities as a result of the intense clashes between the FARDC and M23. Parties to the conflict have used explosive weapons, such as mortar fire and artillery shelling, leaving civilians and civilian infrastructure at increased risk. According to a report by the UN Security Council mandated Panel of Experts, as of July the M23 controlled a territory nearly three times as large as it did in March. Human Rights Watch has documented abuses in areas under their control, including attacks on villages and summary killings of civilians., Amidst the rising violence, the resurgence of M23 has not only resulted in further displacement and atrocities, but also heightened tensions between the government and local populations, as well as with MONUSCO. After dozens of deaths during anti-UN protests in late July, the Congolese government plans to reexamine the withdrawal of MONUSCO. M23’s renewed offensive has also exacerbated regional tensions, particularly between the governments of DRC and Rwanda. On 4 August several media outlets reported that the UN Group of Experts found “solid evidence” of Rwandan troops fighting alongside and providing other support to the M23., The DRC government and neighboring states should pursue regional diplomacy and dialogue to ease tensions and break the cycle of violence. The international community should suspend military assistance to governments found to be supporting the M23 and other abusive armed groups. The DRC government and MONUSCO must rebuild trust and strengthen their partnership to ensure the mission can effectively carry out its mandate. All armed groups must cease their senseless attacks on civilian populations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-312-myanmar-burma-israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territory-and-dr-congo

Agenda item 4
Human rights situations that require the Council’s attention, Summary, The present document is the fourth report submitted by the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar to the Human Rights Council pursuant to resolution 39/2 of 27 September 2018, and it covers the Mechanism’s activities from 16 June 2021 to 30 June 2022., In August 2022, the Mechanism will complete its third year of operations. August will also mark the five-year commemoration of the 2017 clearance operations in Rakhine State, which led to the displacement of nearly 1 million Rohingya people. Tragically for the Rohingya and all the peoples of Myanmar, progress on ending impunity and ensuring accountability for crimes committed remains limited. Established for the purpose of facilitating justice and accountability efforts, the Mechanism continues to collect and analyse a substantial amount of information on the most serious international crimes committed in Myanmar since 2011, including sexual and gender-based crimes and crimes against and affecting children. The information collected and analysed thus far includes evidence that reinforces the Mechanism’s assessment in its previous annual report that crimes against humanity continue to be systematically committed in Myanmar. Furthermore, the information includes evidence of intensified and sustained violence and the existence of various armed conflicts within Myanmar., Despite increasing challenges, the Mechanism seized opportunities to further deepen its collection and analytical activities, increase testimonial evidence, enhance specialized capacities, deploy cutting-edge technology and strengthen engagement with a range of stakeholders. Having made over 120 formal requests for information and assistance and engaged with nearly 200 sources and information providers, the Mechanism’s repository now consists of nearly 3,000,000 information items, including interview statements, documentation, videos, photographs, geospatial imagery and social media material. The evidence collected will facilitate the Mechanism’s efforts to build files that prove the commission of serious international crimes related to priority incidents and in relation to the individuals most responsible for the crimes. The Mechanism aims to facilitate justice for the people of Myanmar, including in proceedings before the International Court of Justice, ongoing investigations before the International Criminal Court, the ongoing investigation by judicial authorities of Argentina and future relevant jurisdictions., The Mechanism remains steadfast in its commitment to engage with all parts of the international community, in particular Member States in the Asia-Pacific region, in order to demonstrate its value as an effective contributor to justice and accountability for the most serious international crimes committed in Myanmar.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/report-independent-investigative-mechanism-myanmar-ahrc514-enarfresruzh
Myanmar: ASEAN approach requires a reboot to end horrific crimes by the Myanmar military,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,8 Aug 2022,"As the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) marks its 55th anniversary today, Amnesty International urges the regional bloc to acknowledge the failure of its five-point plan published in April 2021 to end the violence and increasing human rights violations in Myanmar., “ASEAN must prove it is not a toothless body but acts decisively to hold the Myanmar military to account for its atrocious human rights violations. The military has decades of blood on its hands and will continue to trample on the lives and rights of millions of people in Myanmar if it is not made to face the consequences of its crimes,” said Ming Yu Hah, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Campaigns., “In the face of the continuing atrocities – including executions following unfair trials, extrajudicial killings and torture committed by the Myanmar military – ASEAN must swiftly adopt a more robust course of action so that military leaders end the escalating violent repression they have unleashed since the February 2021 coup.”, To reinforce this message, Amnesty International projected the words “ASEAN must act now!” onto the building of the ASEAN headquarters in Jakarta on Monday., Since February 2021, the Myanmar military has systematically cracked down on tens of thousands of peaceful protesters nationwide, forcing 700,000 people from their homes, killing over 2,000 people and arresting almost 15,000 individuals., “For ASEAN to retain its credibility, it must change its approach to help end the country-wide bloodshed in Myanmar. ASEAN, collectively as a bloc and as individual member states, must also push for justice and accountability in Myanmar. It is imperative that ASEAN plays a constructive rather than obstructionist role and encourages other members of the international community to maximize pressure on the Myanmar military,” Ming Yu Hah said., “We urge ASEAN to demand immediate action from the Myanmar military, including the release of all those who are arbitrarily detained. ASEAN must also address other urgent needs, including committing to the non-refoulement of refugees or anybody else fleeing violence in Myanmar, facilitating desperately needed humanitarian assistance, and adding its voice to calls for a global arms embargo.”, Amnesty International’s Indonesia office was joined by a number of Indonesian civil society groups on Monday as the message to ASEAN was projected onto the organization’s Jakarta HQ., During an ASEAN summit in Jakarta in 2021, Amnesty International reminded Indonesia of its obligation under international law to investigate Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and other Myanmar military officials on credible allegations of responsibility for crimes against humanity in Myanmar., “Myanmar’s military has made a mockery of ASEAN’s ‘Five-Point Consensus’ to reduce violence following the country’s military coup in 2021,” Ming Yu Hah said., “Instead of implementing the agreement, Myanmar’s military has continued to perpetrate grave human rights violations against the population of 54 million.”, In the latest example of its abusive treatment of the Myanmar people, the military executed four men in July after grossly unfair trails – the first executions since the 1980s – with more than 70 people on death row post-coup., In research published in April, Amnesty International recorded increasing state repression in Myanmar, including shootings and beatings against many peaceful protesters. Testimonies indicated that plainclothes police officers are disguising themselves as fruit sellers and trishaw drivers to spy on anyone daring to express dissent. In retaliation against activists, the military has raided their homes and arrested their family members., A report by Amnesty International published in July showed that the Myanmar military is committing war crimes by laying antipersonnel landmines on a massive scale in and around villages in Kayah (Karenni) State., A further report published by Amnesty International on 2 August documented the Myanmar military’s use of torture tactics in detention, including inflicting sexual and gender-based violence and psychological torture. Amnesty’s investigation found that the Myanmar military also committed enforced disappearances and subjected detainees to torture and other ill-treatment in detention centres.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-asean-approach-requires-reboot-end-horrific-crimes-myanmar-military

It is one of the largest camps in the area., “When we first arrived here, we had to use a communal latrine and it took more than five minutes to get there, and sometimes I had to wait and queue for my turn,” she continued. “Cleanliness was also very poor because no one wants to be accountable for communal latrines.”, Daw Naw Oo’s family had to leave their home in the Hlaingbwe Township - one of thousands forced to flee from clashes between armed groups that first began in 2016., They ended up at the Myaing Gyi Ngu camp in 2019., In October 2021, UNICEF and Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) Myanmar, began a new humanitarian project in the camp, where there were only communal latrines for camp residents., A member of the camp committee explained, “The new semi-permanent latrines are constructed for individual families. They last much longer and provide better hygiene than the communal latrines as fewer people use them.”, “The new latrines give us the privacy and security that we need,” said Daw Naw Oo., The UNICEF-supported WASH project has built 248 household latrines, benefitting around 1,877 people, including Daw Naw Oo and her family.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/new-family-latrines-welcomed-displaced-families-unicef-project-provides-hygiene-and-security-displaced-families-enmy

As of 1 August, there were an estimated 1,244,000 internally displaced people (IDP) across Myanmar, including some 897,000 people who have been displaced within the country since 1 February 2021., In the South-East, small-scale IDP returns to their place of origin were reported in areas where fewer clashes have occurred in the last few weeks in Kayin State. Overall, the security situation remained dynamic with armed clashes continuing to trigger new displacements, mainly in Bago (East) Region and Kayin State. Local partners still face security risks and access challenges in areas of active conflict. UNHCR is monitoring the situation in these locations despite the challenges this unpredictable context has on displacement data collection and information verification and the delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance., In the North-West, the situation remained increasingly volatile following an intensification of armed clashes. Artillery fire, aerial attacks and airstrikes, security operations, destruction of houses and properties as well as use of landmines continued to pose significant risks to people’s safety and security., In Kachin and Shan (North), armed clashes and airstrikes risks further exacerbating an already fragile humanitarian situation with displaced families finding safety in churches and monasteries in nearby villages. The situation has been worsened by heavy seasonal rains and flooding in Kachin State, where affected civilians are now staying in collective centres. Daytime robberies, thefts and burglaries are also reportedly on the rise in urban areas., In Rakhine State, humanitarian activities in the north of Maungdaw, Rakhine State (North), have been temporarily suspended since 18 July due to clashes. In Rakhine (Central), civilian arrests (including youth), increased military checkpoints and road and waterway closures were reported.

"Coming to Terms with Myanmar’s Russia Embrace: Crisis Group Asia Briefing N°173, 4 August 2022",Analysis,ICG,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,4 Aug 2022,"What's new? Myanmar's coup and Russia's invasion of Ukraine have brought these already friendly countries closer together. Myanmar's regime has positioned itself as Russia's most uncritical post-invasion partner in Asia, while Russia has readily backed Myanmar's junta, diplomatically and with arms. They are now gearing up for tighter economic and trade relations., Why does it matter? Russia has thrown Naypyitaw a lifeline as it struggles to quash domestic resistance and secure international legitimacy, thus further antagonising countries pushing for Myanmar's return to democracy. The West worries that Moscow could use these ties to dodge sanctions. Foreign governments supporting positive change in Myanmar have few good options., What should be done? With few realistic ways to disrupt Russia-Myanmar relations, foreign governments should continue imposing targeted sanctions on the Myanmar regime and strengthen enforcement of bilateral arms embargoes. They should press ASEAN to keep excluding the regime from high-level meetings but avoid prematurely ending consensus diplomacy at the UN Security Council., Overview, Myanmar's relations with Russia have moved into higher gear in recent years with regular high-level exchanges and closer cooperation. Naypyitaw has also grown increasingly reliant on Moscow for advanced weapons systems and technical training of military officers. Myanmar's February 2021 coup and Russia's invasion of Ukraine a year later have deepened the trends: facing stronger international sanctions and diplomatic isolation, the two countries are actively exploring ways to strengthen their security and economic ties. Countries trying to promote positive change in Myanmar, many of which have adversarial relations with Russia, are concerned that the growing bond undermines efforts to sanction both, but there is little they can do to change it. Instead, they should continue imposing targeted sanctions on Myanmar's military regime, enforcing bilateral arms embargoes, and pressing Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members to continue excluding the regime from high-level meetings to dent its legitimacy. At the UN, however, they should avoid diplomatic moves that might break the Security Council's fragile modus vivendi on Myanmar., Over the past two decades, the Myanmar military has tried to hedge its reliance on China as a diplomatic ally and arms supplier by forging stronger links with Russia. This trend stalled when the country drew closer to the West starting in 2011, and then accelerated following the army's violent expulsion of the Rohingya in 2017, which undermined its nascent engagement with Western militaries., Since then, the two countries have grown closer, with Myanmar Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing making annual visits to Russia. Moscow has so far looked at Naypyitaw primarily as a military and technical partner, with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu leading the effort to position Russia as Myanmar's main supplier of sophisticated weapons, such as helicopters, fighter jets and air defence systems. Russia has also provided postgraduate education to at least 7,000 Myanmar officers since 2001. Beyond military ties, Shoigu also sees advantages in securing a strongly committed partner where South and South East Asia meet, in addition to Russia's longstanding partnerships with India and Vietnam. Until recently, the two countries' economic and non-military trade relations remained modest, but they appear to be deepening. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's 3 August visit to Naypyitaw may accelerate that trend., Following the Myanmar military's coup and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, both countries have become more heavily sanctioned and diplomatically isolated, increasing the importance of their relations with each other. Russia has provided unstinting support for the junta in Naypyitaw following the coup, as well as continued weapons shipments, and the Myanmar regime has in turn positioned itself as Russia's most uncritical friend in Asia, vocally supporting the invasion of Ukraine. In recent months, the two countries have been developing direct banking and finance channels to support greater bilateral trade, including Myanmar purchases of Russian energy products.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/coming-terms-myanmars-russia-embrace-crisis-group-asia-briefing-ndeg173-4-august-2022

The increase was largely driven by rising edible oil prices., Edible oil prices once again surged (+12-13%) following relative stability last month. The increase is due to restrictions placed on imports of palm oil that have led to domestic shortages, combined with high transportation costs., Onion price also surged this month due to low domestic stocks and increase in foreign demand. In some regions, prices are 3-4 times higher than the same time last year., The price of eggs overall stabilized, but with some variability across markets. In Tanintharyi and northern Sagaing, increases were associated with high transportation costs, while in Mandalay, traders again referenced high costs of chicken feed. Across most of the country, egg prices hovered around 1700-2500 Myanmar kyat per 10 eggs., Tomato prices continued to rise this month due to decline in local seasonal production., Fuel price increased from May to June by about 13% and diesel by about 24% and are more than double that of one year ago.

In 2018, camp residents seized the opportunity to start their lives anew when a landowner in the area offered to sell his land to them. Maina Sut Chyai was born after dozens of displaced families procured individual plots with their own personal savings as well as loans from relatives., Construction work commenced soon after with the Karuna Mission Social Solidarity (KMSS), a local partner of UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, constructing houses for each relocated family. To date, 33 formerly displaced families have moved to the village while an additional 65 from the camp are expected move there in the near future., “Previously, we lived in a longhouse with 10 families and did everything there. It was hot, noisy and cramped … it was difficult for us to find privacy,” says Ndau La Raw., Today, his family reside on two spacious plots of land measuring 6,000 square feet with three interconnected structures. The main building functions as the family’s living quarters. Two smaller ones serve as a separate kitchen and a shop where his wife sells groceries. “The shop is my favourite part. It faces the entrance of the village where I get to meet other former camp residents who are now my new neighbours,” says Ndau La Raw., Prospects for return to their villages of origin remain slim for displaced people due to continued fighting and insecurity. Nevertheless, examples of displaced communities finding opportunities to move out of camps and into areas like Maina Sut Chyai, where they can better integrate, are increasingly common in Kachin State. Despite an escalation of armed conflict across Myanmar following the military takeover of 1 February 2021, more than 2,300 Kachin displaced people, out of a population of 95,000, have sought to rebuild their lives by relocating to 19 locations last year., “While not without their challenges, these community-led initiatives are a crucial first step to enabling communities to build a better future for themselves after a decade of displacement,” said Andrew Mok, UNHCR’s Head of Office in Myitkyina, the state capital., To secure a real future in Maina Sut Chyai, residents have been proactive in advocating for key infrastructure. Apart from constructing a hand pump well on their own to draw clean water, the community also sought the support of KMSS and UNHCR to install latrines. The village is also in the process of being connected to the electricity grid with electrical poles and lines gradually installed., Ndau La Raw remains hopeful about the future. Having taught himself carpentry skills, he hopes to set up a business making furniture. “I currently have a workshop in the camp. Once electricity becomes available in Maina Sut Chyai, I will build a new workshop on my own land and grow my business from there.”, Maina Sut Chyai’s relative proximity to Myitkyina, on the opposite bank of the Ayeyarwady River, makes it an attractive place to settle. The city is a regional centre for education, healthcare and work opportunities., “My three kids were young when we were displaced. Two of my children attend university in Myitkyina. I hope to give them the best future so that they can take of themselves as well as me and my wife when we are old,” he says., Written by, Reuben Lim

15 days felt like 15 years: Torture in detention since the Myanmar coup [EN/MY],Analysis,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,2 Aug 2022,"Myanmar: Detainees tortured to crush opposition to coup, Authorities in Myanmar’s prisons and interrogation centres routinely subject people detained for resisting the 2021 military coup to torture and other cruel or degrading treatment, Amnesty International said today in a new briefing, more than a year and a half after the power grab shattered the country’s halting transition to civilian rule., Based on 15 interviews carried out in March 2022 with former detainees, lawyers of prisoners and experts, as well as a review of over 100 news reports, the briefing, 15 Days Felt like 15 Years, documents the horrific experiences of individuals from the moment they are arrested, through their interrogation and imprisonment, and after their release., Since the 1 February 2021 coup, Myanmar’s military has arrested more than 14,500 people and killed more than 2,000, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP)., From showing up without an arrest warrant and forcing confessions through torture or other ill-treatment, to enforceable disappearances, reprisals against relatives, and holding detainees incommunicado from family and legal counsel, military authorities flout the law at every stage of the arrest and detention process., This was horrifically demonstrated in the unlawful execution of four men in July, including a prominent pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker, following their death sentences by a military court. The executions were the first to be carried out in more than 30 years. More than 70 people remain on death row in Myanmar while 41 have been sentenced to death in absentia, according to AAPP., “Myanmar has stooped to unimaginable new lows in its vile and brutal treatment of detainees as part of an overall strategy intended to break their spirits and compel people to give up any resistance to the 2021 military coup,” said Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnes Callamard., “But it is having the opposite effect. The Myanmar people remain unbowed even after the litany of violations, including most recently the shameful and despicable executions of Kyaw Min Yu – also known as Ko Jimmy – Phyo Zeya Thaw, Hla Myo Aung and Aung Thura Zaw.”, “As a matter of urgency, Myanmar’s military must free thousands of people languishing in detention simply for exercising their rights, and let them return to their families. The United Nations Security Council must increase the pressure on the Myanmar military with a referral to the International Criminal Court, a global arms embargo and targeted sanctions.”, Tased and beaten, Amnesty’s research reveals how prison officials kicked and slapped detainees, and also beat them with rifle butts, electrical wires and branches of a palm tree., Detainees allege they were psychologically tortured with death and rape threats to force confessions or extract information about anti-coup activities. One person was presented with a parcel delivery that contained a fake bomb., Several former detainees interviewed by Amnesty International observed that other detainees had visible injuries on their bodies, including blood, broken limbs, and swollen faces., “When they [the police] found us sleeping, they beat us. When they caught us sitting, they beat us…They pointed G3 rifles at our foreheads and threatened that they could kill us anytime,” said one student arrested in the central Magwe Region., One woman heard security forces plunging the head of another detainee in a bucket of water and using a taser on the person several times during interrogation., A student activist told Amnesty International that he saw police bang his friend’s head against the wall. Police also used a taser on his genitals and threatened to blow them up with a grenade., Ma Kyu, who was arrested in Karenni State for protesting the coup, told Amnesty what a police officer told her after she was detained:, “We can just kill you after the arrest. We do not even need to put you in jail. We can simply shoot you.”, ‘They took off my clothes’, Interrogators also committed sexual and gender-based crimes., Saw Han Nway Oo is a transwoman who was arrested and detained in September 2021 by the military on suspicion of having attended self-defence training. She was taken to the Mandalay Palace interrogation centre, which has become notorious for reports of torture., Over three days, she was interrogated at the palace centre and at a police station. She said the interrogators scratched her knees with sharp objects and sprayed methylated spirit over the bleeding wounds. She was not given food or water for three days., “During the interrogation, whenever I used feminine pronouns for myself, they said you are gay, so you must like this and exposed their male genitals in front of me.”, They also looked at messages with her doctor and asked if she had had a sex-change operation. They then took off her clothes, looked at her naked body and mocked her., Other LGBTI people also experienced thorough body checks of their private body parts to ‘‘ensure whether they are males or females,” according to one detainee., Humiliating and invasive body searches may constitute torture or other ill-treatment, particularly for transgender detainees., Blindfolded and cut off, Arrests are typically conducted during the night. During these night raids, soldiers and police break down doors, beat residents, ransack houses, confiscate electronics such as phones and laptops, and occasionally take valuable items such as jewellery., Protest leader Ma Win was arrested while travelling on a passenger bus in Mandalay Region. She was slapped in the face, handcuffed, blindfolded and driven to an unknown location., During an interrogation lasting more than 24 hours, security forces wearing heavy boots beat and kicked her and repeatedly threatened to kill her., Lawyers who Amnesty International spoke to described facing difficulties when trying to discover their clients’ whereabouts. At times, they resorted to paying bribes to get basic information., The prison facilities are crowded, with one person describing staying with 50 people in a cell meant for 10. Detainees also found dead insects and worms in their food., Though the experience of detention has exacted a profound psychological toll on those who have survived it, many activists are determined to keep resisting., “We will never give up,” Saw Han Nway Oo told Amnesty. “We are like phones, we will recharge once we run out of batteries.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/15-days-felt-15-years-torture-detention-myanmar-coup-enmy

ILO Brief: Employment in Myanmar in the first half of 2022: A rapid assessment,Assessment,ILO,Protection and Human Rights,1 Aug 2022,"New ILO estimates show Myanmar remains deeply affected by job losses in first half of 2022, Employment remains well below 2020 levels while productivity levels contract further and job quality deteriorates., BANGKOK, Thailand (ILO news) - Myanmar remains deeply affected by heavy job losses 18 months after the military takeover on 1 February 2021 and two and a half years into the global pandemic, according to new estimates released by the International Labour Organization (ILO)., The ILO estimates that 1.1 million fewer women and men are employed compared to 2020, which indicates a small recovery in jobs in the first half of 2022. However, employment remains well below 2020 levels while the quality of jobs is deteriorating. Women are also more affected than men overall., In the first half of 2022, labour productivity contracted a further 2 per cent, adding to an 8 per cent contraction in 2021, reversing the strong gains that had been made in years prior to the military takeover., Labour conditions are deteriorating for many workers with serious violations of labour rights as referred to in decisions of the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association, ILO Governing Body and in the International Labour Conference Resolution of 2021., The situation has taken a toll on enterprises and workers in key sectors. In the garment industry, evidence points to an increase in casual or daily labour, irregular working hours and workers receiving lower pay. ILO research also shows that more widely, entitlements such as severance pay when workers’ jobs are terminated are also often not granted., “Eighteen months on from the military takeover, the employment situation in Myanmar remains very difficult. While there are limited signs of job growth, the ongoing erosion of labour conditions and the decrease in job quality is deeply concerning,” said Mr Donglin Li, ILO Myanmar Liaison Officer., Further details can be found here ., For further information please contact:

Water Sanitation Hygiene",31 Jul 2022,"This regular update, covering humanitarian developments up to 31 July, is produced by OCHA Myanmar in collaboration with the Inter-Cluster Coordination Group and UN agencies. The next humanitarian update will be issued in August 2022., HIGHLIGHTS & KEY MESSAGES, • More than 1.2 million people are currently displaced across the country. This includes nearly 866,400 people displaced by the conflict and insecurity since the military takeover last year., • Inflation in commodity prices, including for food, fuel, shelter materials and NFIs, remains a major concern to partners in addressing the needs of the most vulnerable. Interim measures are being applied to mitigate against its impact on humanitarian programming where possible, but communities are struggling in the face of cost pressures., • Humanitarians are stepping up efforts to expand support to affected people in northwest Myanmar which hosts the majority of the country’s new IDPs (583,100 as of 25 July 2022)., • Contingency planning is underway as tensions escalate in Rakhine., • The unstable security situation and cyclical displacement across the Southeast and Northwest are exacerbating mental health issues among children and their caregivers, generating increased need for child protection responses in these areas., • In northern Shan, forced recruitment, extortion and landmines continue to put IDPs and host communities at risk., • In Rakhine, there remain significant shelter gaps for displaced people. There are also significant deficits in water availability in the AA-MAF sites in Rakhine and Chin., • In the Southeast, shelter and other humanitarian support is urgently needed for newly displaced people including 5,400 new IDPs in Kyaukkyi township in eastern Bago., • The 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) is only 13 per cent funded prompting the need for prioritization in the second half of the year., KEY FIGURES, 1.2M People internally displaced across Myanmar, 866K People currently displaced by clashes and insecurity since February 2021, 346K People internally displaced due to conflict prior to February 2021, mainly in Rakhine, Kachin, Chin, and Shan, 21K Civilian properties estimated burnt or destroyed since February 2021., Displacement figures fluctuate during any given month. These figures represent the number of people currently displaced. Cumulative numbers for returns and displacement are not always available., SITUATION OVERVIEW, The people of Myanmar continue to bear the brunt of ongoing hostilities and a crippling economic situation that has been compounded by increasing inflation since May. Both crises have entrenched people’s pre-existing vulnerabilities and generated new needs. There are currently, more than 1.2 million internally displaced people (IDPs) in camps and informal displacement sites across the country. Of those who are displaced, 866,4002 fled their homes since the 2021 military takeover. A further 346,600 people are in protracted displacement as a result of conflict prior to 2021, the majority of whom are in Rakhine State. Many of the new IDPs have been displaced multiple times. Many have been sheltering for months in the jungle, where it is difficult to reach them with humanitarian assistance, particularly during the rainy season., During the past year, limited numbers of IDPs have managed to return to their places of origin, but this is sometimes short-lived and most people have been unable to return due to insecurity and ongoing hostilities in their places of origin, the destruction of their homes, or lack of livelihood opportunities. More than 21,000 civilian properties, including homes, churches, monasteries, and schools, have reportedly been destroyed since the military takeover.
Humanitarian partners are trying to reach 6.2 million people with life-saving assistance this year, including IDPs in conflict areas, wherever access is possible. Despite the ongoing access challenges and shortfalls in funding, humanitarian partners have been providing affected people with critical life-saving assistance, including emergency shelter and NFIs, food and livelihood assistance, health and nutrition, education, as well as protection services, including child protection, gender-based violence, legal aid and mine action, to alleviate their suffering and strengthen their resilience. Mid-year results are being finalized now and are expected to show at least 3 million people or almost half the 2022 target have been reached with humanitarian assistance since the beginning of the year. The Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG) is working to identify ways of expanding reach into under-served, high displacement areas, particularly in the Northwest where the response has been challenging. On 29 July, the HCT endorsed a proposal to proceed with the establishment of a sub-national ICCG for the Northwest to improve coordination and information sharing, as well as access advocacy.
Myanmar remains one of only four countries in the world classified by ACAPS as having “extreme” access constraints, alongside Eritrea, Ukraine and Yemen.3 A new analysis of the physical, conflict and stakeholder constraints that are affecting accessibility in different parts of the country has been produced by the Humanitarian Access Working Group.
The analysis indicates that humanitarian access is considered ‘difficult’ or ‘very difficult’ to at least 1.4 million people of the 6.2 million targeted for assistance this year. High-level efforts continue to advocate for access to these areas and donors are encouraged to support efforts by partners in underserved locations where needs are severe, on the understanding that this work may take longer, require more human resources and deliver results on a smaller scale because of the access constraints.
Several inter-agency needs monitoring missions have taken place in the first half of the year. In late June, several UN agencies visited one relocation site, one temporary displacement site and three protracted IDP camps in Kyaukme,
Manton and Namtu townships in northern Shan to assess the overall humanitarian situation of the IDPs and identify need and gaps in responses. Based on the findings of this mission, IDPs are in need of more vocational training activities to support their livelihoods. In Namtu township, IDPs are in need of desludging services and water purifying chemicals. Displaced children have access to public education in these two towns, and health services are also provided, but there is a need to scale-up. With the ongoing increase of commodity prices, the running costs for camps have become challenging within existing allocations, especially in protracted IDP camps and relocation sites in Manton and Namtu townships. The UN, in collaboration with its partners, including local organization, is currently arranging responses to the identified needs. The joint distribution mission to southern Shan that was scheduled for early July in response to a prior needs monitoring mission, remains pending due to travel authorization issues. Advocacy is underway to resolve this delay.
It is critical that humanitarian partners have unconditional, unimpeded and safe access to all affected people wherever they are in Myanmar. Funding is also critically needed, especially in light of the increasing inflation since May 2022, in order to save more lives, protect people and alleviate their suffering. As of 27 July, the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan is only 13 per cent funded, leaving a gap of $719 million (FTS) and clusters will be working to make difficult prioritization decisions for the second half of the year.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-update-no-20-31-july-2022
Mobile-based emergency healthcare eases family worries in Myanmar [EN/MY],News and Press Release,UNICEF,Health,26 Jul 2022,"Bright Start brings many families a lifeline, By Saw Wai Moe and Ruth Ayisi, For many families in Myanmar, the cost of health care – if it is even available – can drain a family’s already meagre income., Thinn Yamone, a mother of two young children aged five months and three years, used to work in a toy factory. She now depends on her husband, a mason - but as there is no demand for building jobs during the rainy season (April-October), he can only do low-paying jobs, such as cutting grass., Some days her husband cannot work at all, as he suffers from pulmonary arterial hypertension. “We barely earn enough to live on,” said Thinn Yamone., The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing crisis in the country has pushed an increasing number of families deep into poverty, particularly those living in urban areas under martial law, like North Okkalar Township in Yangon, where Thin Yamone lives., Her family lives in a makeshift home in her aunt’s compound. They have no electricity or running water and must buy water for drinking and fetch water for washing from a monastery, a 15-minute bike ride away., They share her aunt’s latrine. “We had plans to build a latrine of our own, but those plans have been dashed,” said Thinn Yamone., A rapid mini-survey conducted by UNICEF in 2021 on access to basic services in the Yangon townships of Hlaing-Thar-Yar and Shwe-Pyi-Thar found the main barriers to health services included: unavailability of services (61 per cent); financial barriers (30 per cent); and concerns about safety and security in accessing services (17 per cent). [1], Responding to the needs identified, with generous contribution from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Swiss Natcom, UNICEF launched Bright Start in six townships in peri-urban Yangon, which are home to some of the very poorest families., Bright Start – a joint initiative between UNICEF and a private company, Common Health Myanmar, provides innovative, mobile-based primary health care services., The scheme means that Thinn Yamone no longer has to cut back on food in order to afford to take her children to a doctor., “Since I enrolled in the Bright Start programme, I feel reassured that I have a place to turn to if my children get sick,” said Thinn Yamone., “It has really eased my anxieties,” said Thinn Yamone. “My doctor always explains things thoroughly and carefully. She’s patient. It helps reduce some of our worries so we can now focus on making a living.”, The scheme includes free 24/7 on-call health services with a doctor, health information delivered via voice and text messages and other channels, as well as the provision of outpatient costs and hospital cash grants for serious illnesses or accidents., Pregnant women are entitled to free ultrasound, blood tests and tetanus shots. There is also a complaint and feedback mechanism., Dr. Thae Myat Cho, who joined Common Health Myanmar in February 2022, says she is monitoring about 2,000 service users. “I even treated a child with scabies,” said Dr Thae Myat Cho., “The family had been using ointments their neighbours recommended, but the scabies became infected, and the child developed a fever. I discovered the whole family had scabies. They recovered after using the antibiotics I prescribed.”, To increase digital literacy and overcome communication challenges, Bright Start provides digital support through Viber chatbots., As of June 2022, it has provided free health care to more than 30,000 people, including more than 18,000 children under the age of five and 9,000 under the age of seven., [1] UNICEF survey by phone to 306 household, 31March to 2April 2021",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/mobile-based-emergency-healthcare-eases-family-worries-myanmar-enmy

They recalled the Secretary-General’s statement of 25 July 2022 and echoed his call for the immediate release of all arbitrarily detained prisoners, including President Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi., The members of the Security Council also recalled the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Chair’s Statement of 25 July 2022, which expressed ASEAN’s denunciation and strong disappointment at the execution despite the appeals of the ASEAN Chair and some ASEAN member States for the sentences to be reconsidered. They noted ASEAN’s view that implementation of the death sentences was highly reprehensible and presented a gross lack of will to support the efforts of the ASEAN Chair in expediting progress on the implementation of the Five Point Consensus. They noted ASEAN’s call for utmost restraint, patience and efforts to avoid escalating the situation, and for all parties concerned to desist from taking actions that would only further aggravate the crisis., The members of the Security Council reiterated their strong support to ASEAN and the efforts of the ASEAN Chair and echoed ASEAN’s call for concrete actions to effectively and fully implement the Five Point Consensus. They underlined the important role of the United Nations Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Myanmar and encouraged close coordination with the ASEAN Special Envoy to ensure synergy., The members of the Security Council called for the pursuance of dialogue with all parties concerned and reconciliation in accordance with the will and interests of the people of Myanmar. They also called for an immediate cessation of all forms of violence, including attacks on infrastructure, health and education facilities, for full respect for human rights and the rule of law, and for full, safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to all those in need. They reiterated their full support for Myanmar’s democratic transition and their strong commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity and unity of Myanmar.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/security-council-press-statement-situation-myanmar-27-july-2022-enmy
"Families in Myanmar lose more than half their income in year of conflict, says Save the Children",News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Education
Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",28 Jul 2022,"28 July 2022 – Families in Myanmar have lost on average more than half of their income since the political crisis and escalation of conflict in February 2021, according to Save the Children, with soaring poverty rates threatening to reverse 17 years of economic progress., The economic impact of the political crisis, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, has left families struggling to feed themselves and their children, the child rights organisation said. Some 80% of families said food was their primary concern, with adults in one in five households cutting back on meals in order to feed their children. A third of households are borrowing food or relying on help from others to feed their families., Kin Thida*, 39, lives with her husband and three children in Yangon, Myanmar. She and her husband used to work as masons on a construction site and all three of their children went to school. But since February 2021 and the ensuing economic turmoil, the couple are now both without jobs., “In the past, I could buy some pieces of meat and some vegetables for two meals with around 3000 kyat (around US$1.5), but for now, it’s only enough for one meal, sometimes not even that,” Kin Thida said., Kin Thida’s 17-year-old daughter, Sabal*, had to drop out of school to work in a garment factory to support her family – before she also lost her job due to factory closures., “I need to find another job, but for that I need a national registration card, and to get that I need to travel to my parents’ hometown to apply. I can’t afford the transport to get there,” Sabal said. “I only want to go back to school – that's the only place I was happy. I was hoping to be a nurse after school.”, The political crisis in Myanmar started when the country was already vulnerable. The economic crisis drove an increase in the share of households experiencing moderate to severe food insecurity between August and October 2020., Since February last year the country has suffered further economic decline, with mass job losses, business closures and weakening of the Myanmar currency (kyat), which has affected households across the country., Even middle-income households that were benefiting from the country’s economic growth since 2011 are now being pushed below the poverty line, Save the Children said. Families are reporting an average price increase of between 30% and 70% for basic foods., Earlier this year, the child rights organisation warned that at least 150,000 children had been forced to flee their homes due to violence, and last month reports showed￼ that the number of children out of school had doubled over the past two years., Save the Children called on the international community to do everything it can to prevent the country plummeting into mass poverty and hunger, including stepping up humanitarian funding., Shaheen Chughtai, Regional Advocacy Director for Save the Children in Asia, said:, “More than a year on from the coup, millions of children do not have enough to eat and families are having to beg or borrow to survive. These new figures are especially sobering at a time where humanitarian response is severely underfunded. At a time when children in Myanmar need us most, they are being let down by the international community., ""Deprivation and hunger on this scale is a worrying step backwards for a country that was already struggling to pull itself out of poverty after decades of political turmoil. The speed at which poverty levels are regressing after 17 years of progress – and the impact this is having on children and their families - is an absolute tragedy, and the world must ensure children in Myanmar are not forgotten.”, Save the Children has been working in Myanmar since 1995, providing life-saving healthcare, food, education and child protection programmes through more than 50 partners and 900 staff across the country., ENDS, Content available here: Save the Children - Search Result (contenthubsavethechildren.org), *Names changed to protect identities., https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/myanmar/publication/myanmar-economic-monitor-reports, For further enquiries please contact:, Emily Wight, Emily.Wight@savethechildren.org;, Daphnee Cook, Daphnee.Cook@savethechildren.org;, Our media out of hours (BST) contact is media@savethechildren.org.uk / +44(0)7831 650409, Please also check our Twitter account @Save_GlobalNews for news alerts, quotes, statements and location Vlogs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/families-myanmar-lose-more-half-their-income-year-conflict-says-save-children

FAO and Belgium provide emergency agricultural assistance to conflict-affected communities in Kayin and Kayah states,News and Press Release,FAO,"Agriculture
Contributions",22 Jul 2022,"Belgium contribution through the Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA), Humanitarian needs in Myanmar continue to rise sharply since February 2021 as a result of political and economic upheaval and increased conflict. Approximately 27 percent of the population (14.4 million people) is in need of assistance and more than 700 000 people are internally displaced., Agriculture is a source of livelihoods for nearly 70 percent of the population of Myanmar. The ongoing crisis is compouding the impacts of recurrent climate-induced shocks and COVID-19, posing an enormous threat to the livelihoods and food security of agriculture-dependent communities. Food production is declining, food prices are soaring, and 13.2 million people are already food insecure (compared to 2.8 million before the crisis). Moreover, according to the latest Food Security Monitoring Assessment by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Programme, 16 percent of surveyed households from 14 states/regions across the country do not have sufficient food intake1. In this context, vulnerable households are increasingly resorting to negative coping mechanisms such as the distress selling of their productive assets, which erodes their capacity to manage future shocks., Through SFERA, the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium contributed USD 500 000 to FAO to mitigate the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable households. With this generous contribution, FAO will provide emergency agricultural assistance to 2 000 vulnerable households (10 000 people) in conflict-affected Kayin and Kayah states, in eastern Myanmar. The intervention will include cash-based interventions to enable food-insecure households to cover their immediate needs. Moreover, FAO will provide the beneficiaries with vegetable production packages to enable them to produce up to 500 kg of nutrient-rich vegetables (worth USD 200 on the local market). The intervention will focus on female headed households (61 percent) and will be implemented during the dry season (August 2022–May 2023).",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/fao-and-belgium-provide-emergency-agricultural-assistance-conflict-affected-communities-kayin-and-kayah-states
"Atrocity Alert No. 310: Myanmar (Burma), Afghanistan and Libya",News and Press Release,GCR2P,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",27 Jul 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., FIRST EXECUTIONS IN MYANMAR IN DECADES UNDERSCORE ONGOING MILITARY REPRESSION, Myanmar’s (Burma) military – also known as the Tatmadaw – announced on 25 July that it had executed two democracy activists, as well as two other men, marking the first known executions in the country since 1988. Accused of violent resistance against the military, all four men – Phyo Zeya Thaw, Kyaw Min Yu (also known as Ko Jimmy), Hla Myo Aung and Aung Thura Zaw – were sentenced to death by military tribunals during closed, politically motivated trials. Since the February 2021 coup, over 100 people in Myanmar have been sentenced to death, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. The executions indicate a grave escalation in the Tatmadaw’s repression., The executions received widespread condemnation from the international community, including from UN Secretary-General António Guterres, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and several governments, among others. The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said, “these depraved acts must be a turning point for the international community. What more must the junta do before the international community is willing to take strong action?”, The executions occurred amidst growing evidence of mass atrocities perpetrated by the military throughout the country, including the scorched earth campaign in the northwest. Last week, the military killed at least ten people and burned approximately 500 homes during a raid on a predominantly Muslim village in Sagaing Region – a resistance stronghold. The victims’ bodies were found burned beyond recognition with their hands bound. Amnesty International also recently reported that the Tatmadaw is “systematically” laying antipersonnel landmines in a “massive scale” in and around at least 20 villages in Kayah State. The military has reportedly laid landmines in homes, on farmland and on church grounds, threatening the lives and livelihoods of civilians in contaminated areas. The military’s use of banned landmines likely amounts to war crimes., The international community – especially ASEAN and the UN Security Council – has a responsibility to respond to the deepening crisis in Myanmar with more than just words. The military should heed the calls of High Commissioner Bachelet by reinstating Myanmar’s de facto suspension on the use of the death penalty. All political prisoners and others arbitrarily detained must be immediately released. Member states must stop providing arms and weapons to Myanmar and support efforts to hold those responsible for atrocities to account., UNAMA REPORT REVEALS SYSTEMATIC HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS BY TALIBAN, On 20 July the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) released a report on the human rights situation in Afghanistan since the Taliban militarily took over the country on 15 August 2021. UNAMA’s findings reveal that the Taliban de facto authorities are responsible for a wide range of human rights violations, including arbitrary arrests and detentions, incidents of torture and ill-treatment, excessive use of force and extrajudicial killings. These violations appear to be perpetrated on a systematic and widespread basis., The Taliban have systematically targeted certain groups. According to the report, those most impacted were former government officials and military personnel despite promises of an amnesty. The report highlights that government officials and military personnel were victims of 160 extrajudicial killings, 178 arbitrary arrests and detentions, 23 instances of incommunicado detention and 56 incidents of torture and ill-treatment. The Taliban also perpetrated scores of human rights violations and abuses against persons accused of affiliation with armed groups, such as the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K) and the National Resistance Front. At least 163 media workers and 64 human rights defenders were affected by similar violations since 15 August., The report documented 2,106 civilian casualties, including 700 killed and 1,406 wounded, since the Taliban takeover. The casualties are primarily attributed to ISIL-K as a result of targeted attacks against ethnic and religious minority communities, in particular Hazara Shi’as, Shi’a Muslims and Sufi Muslims. ISIL-K perpetrated these attacks mostly with improvised explosive devices in places of worship, education and other civilian areas., The deterioration in upholding human rights and protecting civilians has been exacerbated by broader restrictions on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, expression and opinion, as well as sweeping restrictions on women’s rights to fully participate in public and daily life. According to UNAMA, the erosion of women’s rights in the past eleven months is “one of the most notable aspects” of the Taliban’s rule to date. Markus Potzel, Acting UN Secretary-General Special Representative for Afghanistan, stressed, “it is beyond time for all Afghans to be able to live in peace and rebuild their lives after 20 years of armed conflict… The people of Afghanistan, in particular women and girls, are deprived of the full enjoyment of their human rights.”, Taliban de facto authorities must uphold all obligations under International Human Rights Law, as well as guarantee the equal protection and promotion of human rights of all Afghans. The Taliban must investigate the patterns of human rights violations documented by UNAMA and take immediate steps to prevent future violations, including holding perpetrators accountable. The Taliban should also allow the international community to provide assistance in meeting all these obligations., UN URGES PROGRESS ON THE POLITICAL IMPASSE IN LIBYA AMIDST CLASHES IN TRIPOLI, On 21 July clashes broke out between armed groups in Libya’s capital of Tripoli, killing at least nine civilians, including three children, according to the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF). The sporadic fighting took place in several populated areas across Tripoli, resulting in damage to civilian infrastructure and homes. UNICEF condemned the fighting, emphasizing that “all children in Libya deserve to live their lives in peace and without the constant threat of violence.” Two days later, brief skirmishes broke out between rival armed groups along the main coastal highway on the outskirts of the city of Misrata., The armed clashes in Tripoli and skirmishes in Misrata are the latest escalation amidst a prolonged constitutional and political stalemate. After successive rival governments vied for control of the country for several years, during March 2021 a provisional government was established. Presidential elections initially scheduled for December 2021 were postponed indefinitely due to security concerns and fundamental disagreements surrounding aspects of the elections. Protests broke out across the country in early July, with demonstrators expressing their frustration over ongoing political divisions and increasing prices of basic commodities in Tripoli. Some protesters set fire to the parliament building in the eastern city of Tobruk on 1 July., Cycles of political deadlock following the overthrow of former President Muammar Qaddafi have repeatedly devolved into armed conflict that has had a devastating impact on civilians in Libya for over a decade. The UN Human Rights Council-mandated Fact-Finding Mission on Libya has alleged that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Libya during these cycles of violence since 2016 by all parties to the conflict, including third state parties, foreign fighters and mercenaries., The latest confrontations in Tripoli are heightening tensions and increasing the risk of atrocities. On 25 July Martha Pobee, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Africa in the Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations, warned that the stalemate was prolonging a highly volatile security environment and human rights abuses. According to Assistant Secretary-General Pobee, there is a risk of escalation as armed groups mobilize behind their preferred political leaders and military activity has increased in the western region., The international community must continue supporting Libya’s transition. Political elites in Libya should heed the calls of their people and demonstrate responsible leadership by addressing the key drivers of the political stalemate and allow for elections to be held as soon as possible.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-310-myanmar-burma-afghanistan-and-libya
Alleged new use of anti-personnel mines by Myanmar would be a terrible assault on the international norm banning the use of this weapon,News and Press Release,AP Mine Ban Convention,Mine Action,25 Jul 2022,"Geneva -- ""The global norm created against the production and use of anti-personnel mines is at danger. The international community needs to raise in unison to condemn any such activity, by any actor anywhere"", said the President of the treaty that bans the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel mines., H.E. Alvaro Enrique AYALA, Ambassador of Colombia to the UN in Geneva, and President of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention (also known informally as Ottawa Convention or Mine Ban Treaty), made the comments following a report published by Amnesty International on 20 July, indicating that the Government of Myanmar has actively engaged in an activity condemned by over 80% of the world's countries., ""As a Colombian, I know too well the terrible implications of the use of anti-personnel mines. They have a devastating long-term impact on communities, impede the safe return of displaced persons, and generate injuries and suffering that last a lifetime. For this reason, even as armed non-state actors littered our countryside with these weapons, Colombia never responded by employing anti-personnel mines. I urge Myanmar to follow that path and refrain from using them. There is no such thing as 'proper or discriminate use' of a weapon that is so insidious, that can not discern between a military target or a child walking home from school"", added the Ambassador citing communication with Myanmar as one of his priorities., While Myanmar remains outside the treaty, it had progressively made significant gains in mine action and shown greater affinity for the means and ends of the Convention. Just this past June, Myanmar had participated as Observer of a meeting of the Convention in Geneva. In 2018, Myanmar also welcomed the Special Envoy of the Convention to meet with military leaders., The norm created by the Convention has been so strong that only a couple of countries have made use of this weapon in more than two decades; unfortunately, this year alone the Convention has received reports of two countries using anti-personnel mines (Russia (see press release), and now Myanmar), neither one party to the treaty. In contrast, in June during a meeting of the Convention in Geneva, the United States announced that it had re-instated moratoria against this weapon., Editorial note: The Convention was adopted in Oslo and signed in Ottawa 25 years ago, and entered into force in 1999. It is the prime humanitarian and disarmament treaty aimed at ending the suffering caused by anti-personnel mines by prohibiting their use, stockpiling, production, and transfer, ensuring their destruction, and assisting the victims. Collectively, the States Parties have destroyed over 54 million stockpiled anti-personnel mines. The implementation of the Convention has contributed to peace and development by clearing vast tracts of land in more than 50 countries, which now safe again are used for normal activity.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/alleged-new-use-anti-personnel-mines-myanmar-would-be-terrible-assault-international-norm-banning-use-weapon

"Myanmar: Bachelet condemns executions, calls for release of all political prisoners",News and Press Release,OHCHR,Protection and Human Rights,25 Jul 2022,"GENEVA (25 July 2022) – UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet today condemned in the strongest terms the execution of four democracy activists by Myanmar’s military despite repeated calls by the United Nations and the wider international community to not carry out death sentences., “I am dismayed that despite appeals from across the world, the military conducted these executions with no regard for human rights,” Bachelet said. “This cruel and regressive step is an extension of the military’s ongoing repressive campaign against its own people., “These executions – the first in Myanmar in decades - are cruel violations of the rights to life, liberty and security of a person, and fair trial guarantees. For the military to widen its killing will only deepen its entanglement in the crisis it has itself created.”, The High Commissioner called for the immediate release of all political prisoners and others arbitrarily detained, and urged the country to reinstate its de-facto moratorium on the use of the death penalty, as a step towards eventual abolition., On 25 July, Myanmar state media reported that the military had executed four people including former National League for Democracy (NLD) lawmaker Phyo Zeya Thaw, democracy activist Kyaw Min Yu, popularly known as Ko Jimmy. Hla Myo Aung and Aung Thura Zaw were the other two men executed., Ko Jimmy and Phyo Zaya Thaw were arrested on 23 October and 18 November 2021 respectively. Ko Jimmy was subsequently charged with sedition. Both Phyo Zayar Thaw and Ko Jimmy were also charged under the Counter Terrorism Law and sentenced to death by a military tribunal on 21 January 2022. Their subsequent appeals were denied. Hla Myo Aung, and Aung Thura Zaw were convicted on murder charges. Their appeals were also denied., In Myanmar, such cases are being heard by military courts behind closed doors. Since the military coup on 1 February 2021, 117 people, including two children, have been sentenced to death including 41 sentenced in absentia. Over 11,500 people remain in detention for opposing the military’s seizure of power., “Most concerningly, over 30 percent of over 2,100 people killed since February 2021 have died in military custody – most as a result of ill-treatment,” said Bachelet., On 3 June, UN Secretary General António Guterres expressed concern at the military’s decision to go ahead with executions and reiterated his calls for the respect of people’s rights to freedom of opinion and expression. Bachelet echoed his call for the military to “drop all charges against those arrested on charges related to the exercise of their fundamental freedoms and rights” and the immediate release of all political prisoners in Myanmar., “The military seems unconcerned with ending this crisis or reducing violence in accordance with its international obligations, let alone any willingness to respect due process, justice or rule of law,” Bachelet said., The High Commissioner reiterated her call to Myanmar’s neighbours and to the wider international community to hold the military accountable to its commitments under international law, as well as further to ASEAN’s “Five-Point Consensus”.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-bachelet-condemns-executions-calls-release-all-political-prisoners

Myanmar: First executions in decades mark atrocious escalation in state repression,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,25 Jul 2022,"Responding to reports that Myanmar’s military authorities have carried out executions for the first time since the late 1980s, Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific Director Erwin van der Borght said: , “These executions amount to arbitrary deprivation of lives and are another example of Myanmar’s atrocious human rights record. The four men were convicted by a military court in highly secretive and deeply unfair trials. The international community must act immediately as more than 100 people are believed to be on death row after being convicted in similar proceedings.”, “For more than a year now, Myanmar’s military authorities have engaged in extrajudicial killings, torture and a whole gamut of human rights violations. The military will only continue to trample on people’s lives if they are not held accountable.”, “At a time when more and more countries take steps to abolish the death penalty, the resumption of executions after more than three decades not only puts it at odds with the global trend, but is also contrary to the goal of abolition enshrined under international human rights law and standards. Myanmar’s isolation could not be any more glaring. We urge the authorities to immediately establish a moratorium on executions as a first critical step.”, Background:, According to Myanmar state media, four executions have been carried out., Phyo Zeya Thaw, a former member of Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy, and prominent democracy activist Kyaw Min Yu, also known as Ko Jimmy, were convicted of and sentenced to death by a military tribunal in January for offenses involving explosives, bombings and financing terrorism under the Anti-Terrorism Law – charges that Amnesty International believes to be politically motivated. Two other men, Hla Myo Aung and Aung Thura Zaw, convicted of the alleged murder of a woman believed to act as an informer for the military in Hlaing Tharyar in Yangon, also had their death sentences confirmed., All four were named in the report in state-run newspaper Global New Light of Myanmar., The proceedings before a military-controlled court were secretive and grossly unfair., Following Myanmar military’s issuance of Martial Law Order 3/2021, the authority to try civilians was transferred to special or existing military tribunals where individuals are tried through summary proceedings without right to appeal., These courts oversee a wide range of offences including those punishable with the death penalty., Under international law and standards, executions carried out following unfair trials violate the prohibition against arbitrary deprivation of life, as well as the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment., Myanmar’s last known execution was in the late 1980s. Since the military coup in February 2021, Amnesty International has recorded an alarming increase in the resort to the death penalty in Myanmar, where it has become a tool for the military in the ongoing persecution, intimidation and harassment of all who dare to challenge the authorities., Amnesty International opposes the death penalty unconditionally, in all cases and under any circumstances. More than two-thirds of countries all over the world have abolished the punishment in law or practice.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-first-executions-decades-mark-atrocious-escalation-state-repression

The Dynamics of Arakan Politics and the Possibility of Another War,News and Press Release,TNI,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,22 Jul 2022,"A Myanmar Commentary by Kyaw Lynn, Tensions are rising in Arakan (Rakhine State) where a ceasefire exists between the Myanmar military government and Arakan Army. On the surface, the relative stability contrasts with the chaos that has enveloped many other parts of the country following last year’s coup. In this commentary, Kyaw Lynn analyses the changing landscape highlighting that, while confrontations are occurring, neither side appears yet ready to return to open warfare. “Retaliatory” actions, though, are increasing., Twenty months after an informal ceasefire between the Myanmar military and Arakan Army (AA), social and political stability in Arakan (Rakhine State) are deteriorating, leading many local people to worry about the future. Many changes have taken place in the country since the introduction of this de facto ceasefire, not least the coup by the military State Administrative Council (SAC) in February 2021. And it now seems that both parties to the agreement – the Myanmar military and AA – are starting to recalculate their military strategies and political interests. Tit for tat actions have become commonplace. This was highlighted on 22 June, when SAC troops arrested 30 local Rakhine people in response to the AA arresting three government staff from the “Intelligence and Investigation Department” in Mrauk-U, the ancient capital of Arakan and one of the most conflict-sensitive townships in Rakhine State., Before this event, tensions were visibly growing between the SAC and the United League of Arakan (ULA), the political wing of the AA. In the preceding weeks, the AA had arrested military and police force members in Kyauktaw, Ponnagyun and Tin Nyo, Mrauk-U township, as well as Ramree in southern Rakhine State. As an explanation, the ULA-AA spokesperson Khaing Thu Kha told a party press conference on 14 June that they had been arrested in response to the growing number of ULA and AA members being seized by the SAC authorities in different parts of the state. “Hostage exchange” is possible, he said, if the SAC is willing. In the ULA-AA’s defence, he argued that the arrests were an “equivalent retaliation” for the SAC’s breaking the promises of the informal ceasefire not to arrest unarmed and non-uniformed members on both sides. Khaing Thu Kha also had sobering words of warning. During the press briefing, he repeatedly stated that the outbreak of “another war” could happen at any time and that mediation through third parties was not working., The people continue to watch the situation closely. But the past month has not shown any notable improvements, and it seems that the spate of arrests are just the tip of the iceberg in revealing deeper reasons for the changing trends in Arakan politics. A critical time is approaching., A ceasefire of distrust, When the informal ceasefire was initiated in November 2020, it caused surprise for many people both inside and outside of the country. Coming in the aftermath of the 2020 general election, the timing seemed odd, and for many observers the real intentions of the leaders of the Myanmar military for accepting such a ceasefire were only revealed when they staged their coup on 1 February 2021. Until the ceasefire turning-point, it was Myanmar’s military leaders who had always refused to recognise the ULA-AA’s existence in Arakan and insisted that they would eradicate the movement by military means in line with their “black and white” definitions of combatting opponents. In essence, “white” areas are those that the government is perceived to control and “black” are under armed opposition which, military leaders say, must be destroyed., Certainly, in the months following the coup the SAC leaders sought to take advantage in Arakan by a combination of different measures. On the political front, the SAC attempted to build on the rivalry between the National League for Democracy (NLD) and Rakhine political parties – the Arakan National Party (ANP) and Arakan Front Party (AFP) – in the electoral space. To try and achieve legitimacy for the SAC, a number of ANP members were included in SAC administrative structures and Dr. Aye Maung, the AFP chair and a former ANP leader, was released from prison. Such gestures appeared more profitable for the SAC in Rakhine State where, given the electoral opposition to the NLD in many constituencies (especially in the north and centre of the state), the regime faced less protest reaction in urban areas when compared to other parts of the country following the coup., During these difficult months, the AA ceasefire further added to a lessening in security and political challenges faced by the regime after the SAC’s assumption of power – both in Arakan and Myanmar at large. For several months the security situation appeared more stable in Arakan in contrast to the chaos that had enveloped other parts of the country following the coup. This meant that, at the union level, the SAC military no longer needed to provide intensive operational attention to Rakhine State which, until the AA ceasefire, had been the most active conflict region in Myanmar. In line with this new strategy, the SAC leadership sought to contain ULA-AA activities on the one hand while taking profits from political stability and economic extraction on the other. Located on the country’s western seaboard, Rakhine State is an important source of revenue to the regime, including oil and gas pipelines that run to Yunnan Province in China., Containing the ULA-AA, however, did not prove a simple option after several years of warfare. To implement this policy, a raft of activities was laid out. These included re-building military and police apparatus across the state and adjoining Paletwa township in Chin State where the ULA-AA is also based; increasing intelligence surveillance; re-organising broken administrative structures by forcing village-tract leaders not to cooperate with the ULA authorities; and threatening ULA administrative and judiciary activities in territories that the SAC regards as its exclusive sphere of influence., The main focus of these pressures was generally in urban areas of northern Rakhine State as well as southern townships, such as Kyaukpyu, Ramree and Taungup, where there had been no strong AA movement during the previous round of conflict. At the same time, the SAC military presence was reinforced by the maintenance of trade and travel sanctions inside and along the borders of Rakhine State. In essence, although the truce was sustained, many people experienced a more difficult economic and security situation following the 2020 ceasefire., Inevitably, such behaviour proved unacceptable to the ULA-AA leadership. After several months of ceasefire initiation, the ULA-AA chief, Gen. Twan Mrat Naing, declared the movement’s policy of “state-building” and “nation-building” as the fundamental task of the Arakan people on 10 April 2021 on the 12th anniversary of the Arakan Army’s foundation. ULA-AA leaders also called for faster action to support progress on the ground in the ceasefire aftermath. After three years of intense conflict and deepening poverty, the ULA-AA wanted to prioritise reconstruction, resettle displaced peoples, build new infrastructure and promote socio-economic development for the general population while securing political stability in Rakhine State., For this reason, Yohei Sasakawa, Japan’s Goodwill Ambassador for the Welfare of the National Races in Myanmar and Chairman of the Nippon Foundation, had been welcomed to play a visible role in the initiation of the Arakan ceasefire. However, within months of the SAC coup, it quickly became clear that the situation was not developing as the ULA leadership had desired. While trying to crack down on the expansion of ULA administrative and judiciary systems in southern Rakhine State, the SAC was continuing to impose trade and travel restrictions on local communities across the territory., The ULA-AA spokesperson Khaing Thu Kha spoke openly of deepening concerns at the party press conference in June this year:, “We, the ULA-AA, are waiting and watching such aggressive and inhospitable actions of the SAC authority as we want more freedom and better socio-economic conditions for our people while maintaining political stability in Rakhine State. However, if their actions are becoming more aggressive than we can tolerate, we want to warn that it could lead to an even greater deterioration in relations.”, As tensions continue to deepen, many people are asking the same question: “What do we actually get from a de facto ceasefire like this?”, Ceasefire in Arakan but fighting in other areas, In his 2021 address on the 12th anniversary of the AA’s foundation, Gen. Twan Mrat Naing stated that the ULA-AA does not want the Civilian Disobedience Movement and other anti-military or pro-democracy movements to become active in Arakan because the organisation has its own “Way of Rakhita” philosophy to bring about social and political change. Since this time, many people in Arakan and outside became interested in what the “Way of Rakhita” means and how it can guide the civil and political movements in Rakhine State in the face of the complex political landscape that exists countrywide., There is, in fact, no official definition or document about the “Way of Rakhita”. But based on interviews and speeches by the ULA-AA leadership, it is usually summarised as a “way of thinking which is solely based on the national interest of Arakan people rather than any other philosophical or political values and principles.” In line with this philosophy, the ULA-AA leadership started to re-shape the politics of Arakan in new ways following the SAC coup. At the time, they thought this strategy would be better following the ceasefire in pursuit of their political goals and interests., In Gen. Twan Mrat Naing’s most recent speech, however, there was a very different tone. Speaking two months ago on the 13th anniversary of the AA founding, he said: “Comrades, be ready to fight when ordered!”, It was an occasion that attracted attention. On the same day, the rival National Unity Government (NUG) and more than a dozen armed opposition groups, including the (Kokang) Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and Ta’ang National Liberation Army, sent their own “congratulatory statements” in solidarity with the ULA-AA. Notably, a number of these movements are newly established since the coup and are engaged in anti-SAC military activities in other parts of the country. New groups include the Burma People`s Liberation Army, Student Armed Force, People’s Revolutionary Alliance (Magway), Karenni National Defence Force, Asho Chin Defence Force, Mara Defense Force and Chin Defence Force (Mindat). In some of their statements, they mentioned the support of the ULA-AA in terms of military training and equipment., This is not the only link that exists between the ULA-AA and anti-SAC movements. News has continued to emerge about AA soldiers fighting – or being present – in conflict frontline areas in Kachin and northern Shan States alongside other ethnic armed organisations since the SAC coup. In a recent example, six AA soldiers were killed in an air raid in Karen State in early July where they were stationed in territory administered by the Karen National Union (KNU). Technically, the KNU also has a ceasefire with the Myanmar military (initiated in 2012), and the air strike was considered a hostile act. But it is generally safe to argue that the AA, outside of Arakan, has not truly been under a ceasefire following the SAC takeover., Against this backdrop, relations between the SAC and ULA-AA leaderships have been stalling. A lower-level ULA political team attended the 73rd anniversary of Union Day, held by the SAC at Nay Pyi Taw in February, where they argued for the release of their members who have been arrested. But ULA-AA leaders declined a peace talk invitation by the SAC Chairman, Sen-Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, in May this year. Although two key ULA-AA allies in the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee – the United Wa State Army and National Democratic Alliance Army – chose to participate in the talks, the ULA-AA did not release an official statement explaining their refusal. But one informal response by the ULA Secretary Dr. Nyo Twan Awng appeared on social media: “The SAC still does not change its policy about ethnic rights for the peace talks.” Reflecting the deepening divide, the NUG then declared its recognition of the “Arakan People’s Government”, which is led by the ULA, at the end of May following an online meeting between NUG and ULA leaders., All such events are raising speculation in Arakan politics. During the past two years, changes have happened rapidly, and the path that the ULA-AA is following is sure to make the SAC leadership angry. However it is still too early to say that the ULA is totally on the side of the NUG against the SAC, and it will mostly like not want to choose one “government” over another in the struggle between the two camps: the SAC and NUG. In explanation of this ambiguity, the strategy of ULA leaders cannot be understood on the basis of dialectical thinking between the SAC or NUG but only realised through the “Way of Rakhita” philosophy, which is centred upon the “Arakan National Interest” and not subject to any outside political domain., The Rohingya crisis: old challenges and new questions, Adding to the complexity of pressures, the question of the Rohingya community in Arakan is also becoming more difficult to answer. On 21 June, the ULA released a statement warning the people to avoid a recurrence of communal violence in Rakhine State due to a series of incidents that were causing tensions to rise and accused the SAC of being involved. These included the kidnapping of two ethnic Rakhine teachers in Maungdaw township, who were released one week later in exchange for 5 million takas on the Bangladesh side of the border, and the bullying and beating of a young Rohingya man in Pauktaw township. Subsequently, the ULA-AA leader Gen. Twan Mrat Naing accused the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army of being the culprit behind the kidnappings, stating that this was a grave disservice to efforts for social cohesion and trust-building among communities in Arakan as well as to Rohingya refugees who want to come back to their homes., The situation, however, is much changed since the first round of communal violence in 2012. Large segments among both communities today believe that they cannot allow another outbreak of violence in Rakhine State and, if this happened, it would only prove beneficial to the SAC which prefers the tactics of “divide and rule” to cause disharmony among different peoples and communities. At the same time, it needs to be recognised that community reconciliation in Rakhine State is not an all-finished task, and there is still no common vision about the future of Arakan., This theme was taken up in a recent International Crisis Group (ICG) report about the political situation in Arakan, which made a number of points suggesting the formalization of the informal ceasefire with the initiation of a Rohingya repatriation process.* The ICG recommendations, which are based on achieving tripartite relations between SAC, ULA and Bangladesh government, are quite welcoming on a peace and repatriation process. There are, however, still many challenges in implementing such a sensitive programme due to the rise in political instability and lack of common understanding between the different actors and communities that need to become involved., Despite the desire to avoid any repetition of communal violence, many different opinions still exist on the ground. For example, there has been a significant change in perceptions among the ethnic Bamar majority since the SAC coup as well as a NUG policy declaration towards addressing the Rohingya crisis. But these views cannot be regarded as the same as those of ULA-AA leaders nor the Rakhine majority population in Arakan. Similarly, while there is competition between SAC and NUG leaders over gaining international recognition for their governments in handling the Rohingya issue, the ULA-AA is much more focused on building local and international support for the achievement of an Arakan State as part of any process of resolving the Rohingya and other socio-political challenges. The SAC, NUG and ULA see the Rohingya crisis with very different priorities and perspectives., In summary, collaboration will be needed among different actors to solve the Rohingya crisis, and this will mean mediation among competing interests. But, at present, this will not be an easy task at all., The possibility of another war in Arakan, For the moment, it is difficult to estimate the possibility of a resumption of armed conflict in Arakan, and how this might come about. Politics aside, there are other strategic interests that both parties to the ceasefire have to consider. Two, in particular, stand out: intention and capability. Both play important roles in the power competition between the two sides, with the expansion of either party – and hence its capacity – making the other doubtful about their rival’s intentions and vice-versa. As such, an increase in capability has the potential to change the intention of one side or the other at any time. Such is the state of play in Arakan., For this reason, one of the key factors hindering another outbreak of armed conflict in Arakan is the lack of a clear “war mission” for both parties. The current situation, both in Arakan and the country more generally, encourages both parties to keep to the ceasefire status quo and be generally defensive about developing and implementing another war strategy due to their limited capacities on the ground. It is also very difficult to relate the post-coup combat involving new People’s Defence Forces and other anti-SAC movements in other parts of the country, where there are no ceasefires, to the particular challenges in Arakan. In essence, both SAC and ULA-AA leaders may feel that they have more to lose than gain by returning to open conflict in Arakan at this time., If fighting breaks out, for example, the ULA-AA would be expected to try and “conquer and control” some of the urban areas and key communication channels in northern Rakhine State at the least, while the SAC would return to the familiar tactics of the Myanmar military in launching “regional clearance” operations against AA strongholds in rural and mountain areas. In the present impasse, however, both parties appear to have limited capability to carry these objectives out. For the ULA-AA gaining control of new areas requires new technology, human resource training and supplies of military equipment. In contrast, attempts at SAC “domination” will also face logistical challenges and strong resistance because the regime cannot provide enough soldiers or open new battlefronts due to the scale of fighting in other parts of the country., Such realities indicate that the return to war in Arakan may ultimately be determined by the changing military pendulum between the SAC and anti-SAC forces in central Myanmar and the different ethnic states around other international borders. The country is presently in a deep state of civil war in which Arakan has, in many respects, been an exception until now. But this does not mean that there will be no armed clashes between SAC and ULA-AA forces in the meantime. Conditions of what can be termed “limited war” still exist in areas like Paletwa township and other disputed areas where both sides have strategic objectives. Many lives could still be lost and properties destroyed, similar to the intense fighting between 2018-20, and this time the battlefields will be even closer to the major towns and villages, especially in northern Rakhine State., Until the present day, the AA is arresting military and police members in several front-line areas, while the SAC is apprehending civilians suspected of supporting the ULA-AA in such nationalist strongholds as Ponnagyun, Kyauktaw and Mrauk-U townships. Currently, more than 30 local people have been charged by the SAC authority under Article 505 of the Penal Code, accused of incitement or state defamation, although some have been released. Occasional clashes are still being reported, most recently in Maungdaw township where it was reported this week that 14 police and troops were captured and a number killed in a “retaliatory” AA attack for the air raid that killed six members in Karen State. And causing growing anger in local communities, the Rakhine Ethnic Congress reported in early July that six civilians had been killed and eleven wounded during the previous two months in explosions caused by landmines which the SAC military is planting outside its bases. All such incidents are putting pressure on the ULA leadership to fight back against the SAC., Many fear that, whether it suits the SAC or ULA-AA or not, the clock towards a return to open warfare is now ticking. In the international community, there is only one country which can seek to manage the unpredictable and changing dynamics in Arakan: that is China. With strategic and economic interests, Chinese officials have relationships with all sides on Myanmar’s political divides., The situation is different for Western governments. But there are still many things that they can try in order to prevent the outbreak of war in Arakan. They know that Western engagement with the SAC risks legitimatization of the regime which is an outcome that all wish to avoid. Instead, they can prepare in providing emergency and humanitarian assistance through different channels, including trans-border through the Bangladesh and India borders. There is also potential, as the ICG has suggested, that reaching a formal ceasefire agreement between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army might – at some stage in the future – prevent a further humanitarian disaster and provide the chance for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh to return to Arakan., This is not, however, the time for naivety nor failure to understand the complexity of challenges in Arakan and Myanmar at large. The aspirations, needs and perceptions of the people must come first. And, in this respect, the current trends in national politics are loading more weight into negative directions where the future of Arakan is concerned., Kyaw Lynn is a post-graduate student mastering in Political Science at the University of Yangon.

Statement on the ICJ’s Rejection of Preliminary Objections in Rohingya Genocide Case,News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,22 Jul 2022,"The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect welcomes the judgment delivered today, 22 July, by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the preliminary objections raised by Myanmar (Burma) in the case concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (The Gambia v. Myanmar). In rejecting Myanmar’s preliminary objections, the ICJ can proceed with the merits of the case and is one step closer to achieving justice for the Rohingya., The preliminary objections raised by Myanmar were an overt attempt to block and delay justice and reconciliation for the Rohingya, as well as to escape accountability for genocide and crimes against humanity. The objections were also made in an effort to maintain the culture of impunity that has persisted in Myanmar for decades. The Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect appreciates that the ICJ agrees that Myanmar’s preliminary objections lacked any weight or merit., Savita Pawnday, Executive Director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said, “impunity for perpetrators like General Min Aung Hlaing and other military leaders not only facilitated the perpetration of mass atrocity crimes against the Rohingya and other minorities but also enabled the 2021 coup and created a permissive environment for the ensuing violence and atrocities across Myanmar. The Global Centre looks forward to the next stages of the case.”, Justice and accountability are important to upholding the Responsibility to Protect populations from genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Still, accountability processes on their own are not enough. It is important to note that Myanmar has failed to uphold the provisional measures ordered by the ICJ in January 2020 to protect the Rohingya from further violence, and the international community has never put sufficient pressure on Myanmar – both the former civilian-led government and the current junta – to ensure compliance with these measures. The estimated 600,000 Rohingya remaining in Myanmar continue to face systematic discrimination and are at high risk of atrocity crimes, as the military commits widespread and systematic human rights violations against civilians, particularly those from ethnic minority populations., While the ICJ’s decision is a positive development, the road to much needed justice and reconciliation for the Rohingya remains a long one. Ms. Pawnday said, “As the case goes forward, it is essential that the ICJ centers the voices and perspectives of the Rohingya in its proceedings. States should urge compliance with the provisional measures. States can also aid in ensuring accountability by formally intervening in the case — particularly Canada and the Netherlands, who announced their intention to do so in 2020.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/statement-icjs-rejection-preliminary-objections-rohingya-genocide-case

Unofficial, No. 2022/24
22 July 2022, THE HAGUE, 22 July 2022. The International Court of Justice, the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, has today delivered its Judgment on the preliminary objections raised by the Republic of the Union of Myanmar in the case concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (The Gambia v. Myanmar)., Myanmar raised four preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the Court and the admissibility of the Application., In its first preliminary objection, Myanmar argued that the Court lacked jurisdiction, or alternatively that the Application was inadmissible, on the ground that, according to Myanmar, the “real applicant” in the proceedings was the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation., According to the second preliminary objection, the Application was inadmissible because The Gambia lacked standing to bring the case., Myanmar asserted in its third preliminary objection that the Court lacked jurisdiction, or that the Application was inadmissible, since The Gambia could not validly seise the Court in light of Myanmar’s reservation to Article VIII of the Genocide Convention., In its fourth preliminary objection, Myanmar contended that the Court lacked jurisdiction, or alternatively that the Application was inadmissible, because there was no dispute between the Parties under the Genocide Convention on the date on which the Application was filed., In its Judgment, which is final, without appeal and binding on the Parties, the Court:, (1) Unanimously,, Rejects the first preliminary objection raised by the Republic of the Union of Myanmar;, (2) Unanimously,, Rejects the fourth preliminary objection raised by the Republic of the Union of Myanmar;, (3) Unanimously,, Rejects the third preliminary objection raised by the Republic of the Union of Myanmar;, (4) By fifteen votes to one,, Rejects the second preliminary objection raised by the Republic of the Union of Myanmar;, IN FAVOUR: President Donoghue; Vice-President Gevorgian; Judges Tomka, Abraham, Bennouna, Yusuf, Sebutinde, Bhandari, Robinson, Salam, Iwasawa, Nolte, Charlesworth; Judges ad hoc Pillay, Kress;, AGAINST: Judge Xue;, (5) By fifteen votes to one,, Finds that it has jurisdiction, on the basis of Article IX of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, to entertain the Application filed by the Republic of The Gambia on 11 November 2019, and that the said Application is admissible., IN FAVOUR: President Donoghue; Vice-President Gevorgian; Judges Tomka, Abraham, Bennouna, Yusuf, Sebutinde, Bhandari, Robinson, Salam, Iwasawa, Nolte, Charlesworth; Judges ad hoc Pillay, Kress;, AGAINST: Judge Xue., Judge Xue appends a dissenting opinion to the Judgment of the Court; Judge ad hoc Kress appends a declaration to the Judgment of the Court.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/application-convention-prevention-and-punishment-crime-genocide-gambia-v-myanmar-court-finds-it-has-jurisdiction-entertain-application-filed-gambia-and-application-admissible
World court rejects Myanmar objections to genocide case,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,22 Jul 2022,"ICJ Decision Advances Justice for Rohingya, (The Hague) – The International Court of Justice (ICJ) on July 22, 2022, rejected Myanmar’s preliminary objections to the case brought by Gambia under the international Genocide Convention, Human Rights Watch said today. The case concerns Myanmar’s alleged genocide against the ethnic Rohingya population in Rakhine State, with a focus on military operations launched in October 2016 and August 2017., Gambia filed the case before the ICJ in November 2019 alleging that the Myanmar military committed the genocidal acts of “killing, causing serious bodily and mental harm, inflicting conditions that are calculated to bring about physical destruction, imposing measures to prevent births, and forcible transfers … intended to destroy the Rohingya group in whole or in part.”, “The ICJ decision opens the door toward an overdue reckoning with the Myanmar military’s murderous campaign against the Rohingya population,” said Elaine Pearson, acting Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “By holding the military to account for its atrocities against the Rohingya, the World Court could provide the impetus for greater international action toward justice for all victims of the Myanmar security forces’ crimes.”, In February 2022, the ICJ heard Myanmar’s four objections challenging the court’s jurisdiction and Gambia’s legal standing to file the case, as well as Gambia’s response., In its ruling, the court unanimously rejected three of Myanmar’s objections, and rejected one by a vote of 15 to 1. The judgment affirmed that “the applicant in this case is the Gambia”; that “a dispute relating to the interpretation, application and fulfilment of the Genocide Convention existed between the parties at the time of the filing of the application by the Gambia”; and that “the Gambia, as a state party to the Genocide Convention, has standing to invoke the responsibility of Myanmar for the alleged breaches of its obligations under Articles I, III, IV and V of the Convention.”, In response to Myanmar’s argument that Gambia has no standing to bring the case due to its lack of ties to Myanmar or the Rohingya, the court concluded, “All the States parties to the Genocide Convention thus have a common interest to ensure the prevention, suppression and punishment of genocide, by committing themselves to fulfilling the obligations contained in the Convention.”, By rejecting the preliminary objections, the ICJ is allowing the case to proceed on the merits to examine Gambia’s genocide allegations against Myanmar. Myanmar will now have to submit its response to Gambia’s main arguments filed in October 2020 detailing its case., The ICJ case is not a criminal case against individual suspects, but a legal action brought by Gambia against Myanmar alleging that Myanmar bears responsibility for genocide as a state., In December 2019, the court held hearings on Gambia’s request for provisional measures to protect the Rohingya remaining in Myanmar from genocide, which it unanimously adopted in January 2020. The provisional measures require Myanmar to prevent all genocidal acts against the Rohingya, to ensure that security forces do not commit acts of genocide, and to take steps to preserve evidence related to the case. The court also ordered Myanmar to report on its compliance with the provisional measures every six months., Myanmar is legally bound to comply with the order. However, Human Rights Watch and other groups have continued to document grave abuses against the 600,000 Rohingya remaining in Myanmar, contravening the provisional measures. The severe restrictions imposed on the Rohingya by the Myanmar authorities amount to the crimes against humanity of persecution, apartheid, and severe deprivation of liberty. Since the February 2021 coup, the military junta has placed even greater movement restrictions and harsher punishments on Rohingya for attempting to leave Rakhine State., State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi led the Myanmar delegation at the December 2019 opening hearings of the ICJ. Since her arrest during the 2021 coup, Suu Kyi has been sentenced to 11 years in prison, while facing over 180 years total on various fabricated charges., In the preliminary objections hearings, Myanmar was represented by the junta’s Minister for International Cooperation Ko Ko Hlaing and Union Attorney General Thida Oo, whom the United States and other governments have sanctioned for their roles in the military regime. Since the 2021 coup, the junta has imposed a brutal nationwide crackdown, killing over 2,000 people and arbitrarily arresting over 14,000., While the opposition National Unity Government (NUG) and others raised concerns regarding the junta’s representation of Myanmar at the February hearings, the junta’s participation has no bearing on its recognition at the United Nations as Myanmar’s legitimate representative, Human Rights Watch said., The court’s decision on Myanmar’s preliminary objections should encourage the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Canada, and other concerned governments to support Gambia’s case through formal interventions to bolster the legal analysis on specific aspects of the Genocide Convention as it relates to the Rohingya, Human Rights Watch said., Under article 41(2) of the ICJ Statute, the court’s order for provisional measures is automatically sent to the UN Security Council. As the fifth anniversary of the military’s atrocities against the Rohingya approaches, Security Council members should take steps to address the failure to secure justice and security for the Rohingya. Council members should work to adopt a resolution that gives the International Criminal Court (ICC) a mandate over the situation in Myanmar and severs the junta’s supply of arms and revenue, even if the resolution would be vetoed by Russia or China., As the Myanmar armed forces continue to carry out atrocities against civilians and ethnic minorities, the ICJ remains one of the few available paths for holding the military to account. Ethnic groups and human rights defenders have aligned in Myanmar to push for the establishment of democratic rule, efforts that are amplified by the pursuit of justice at the ICJ., “Concerned governments seeking to be leaders for accountability in Myanmar should formally intervene in the Genocide Convention case,” Pearson said. “The case provides an important opportunity to scrutinize the Myanmar military’s abusive policies and practices that have preserved its power over decades.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/world-court-rejects-myanmar-objections-genocide-case
BROUK Welcomes Decision By ICJ – British Government Must Now Join The Case,News and Press Release,BROUK,Protection and Human Rights,22 Jul 2022,"The Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK) today welcomed the decision by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to reject all preliminary objections by Burma to the case brought by the Gambia that Burma broke the genocide convention. This means that the case can finally continue., “This decision is a great moment for justice for Rohingya, and for all people of Burma. This ruling shows that there is a possibility to challenge to the military’s impunity”, said Tun Khin, President of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK). “The objections raised by Burma were nothing but a blatant delaying tactic, and we are pleased that this landmark genocide trial can now finally begin in earnest.”, BROUK also called on the British government to join the case. The British government has used the objections as an excuse not to make a decision on whether to join. This was the latest in a series of flimsy excuses made by the Foreign Office, while at the same time claiming it supported justice and accountability., “For too long, the British government has dragged its feet over justice for the Rohingya, and all the people of Burma. Now, they must join the Rohingya genocide case at the ICJ,” said Tun Khin., Both Canada and the Netherlands together formally declared their intention to intervene in September 2020., The case at the ICJ is the first time ever that Burma has had to defend their record in front of an international court of law. It is not only important for the Rohingya, but all people of Burma who are suffering under the military’s abuses and attacks. Ethnic organisations and civil society organisations from Burma have expressed their support for the case. Moreover, over 100 MPs in the British Parliament have called on the government to join the case., “We are now looking to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to show that she is serous in tackling gross human rights violations and breaches of international law, including genocide, and announce her intention to join the case,” said Tun Khin., For more information, contact Tun Khin on +44 7888714866",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/brouk-welcomes-decision-icj-british-government-must-now-join-case

"Myanmar Economic Monitor, July 2022: Reforms Reversed [EN/MY]",Analysis,World Bank,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition
Recovery and Reconstruction",21 Jul 2022,"Myanmar economy remains fragile, with reform reversals weakening the outlook, YANGON, July 21, 2022 –Myanmar’s economy has faced a series of external and internal disruptions which have impeded recovery from the large contraction in economic activity last year. The absence of a substantial rebound in growth – with GDP in 2022 estimated to still be around 13 percent lower than in 2019 – means that livelihoods and coping mechanisms will continue to be severely strained. About 40 percent of the population is living below the national poverty line in 2022, unwinding nearly a decade of progress on poverty reduction, according to The World Bank’s Myanmar Economic Monitor released today., Myanmar’s economy is projected to grow 3 percent in the fiscal year ending in September 2022, following an 18% contraction last year. Weak economic activity is indicative of the range of constraints facing the Myanmar economy. These include a sharp rise in the prices of imported inputs and consumer goods, partly attributable to the war in Ukraine; elevated levels of domestic conflict; electricity outages; and persistent logistics and financial sector disruptions. Recent policy shifts have added to challenges for businesses. Burdensome trade license requirements, the abandonment of the managed float exchange rate regime, and the imposition of foreign currency surrender rules have resulted in shortages of key imported inputs and inhibited exporters. Uncertainty among businesses has increased due to the rapid issuance of new policy instructions, including exemptions to previously imposed restrictions, followed by subsequent attempts to revoke those exemptions., “Myanmar last year experienced one of the worst economic contractions in the world, and the limited growth we forecast this year leaves its economic recovery far behind other countries,” said World Bank Country Director for Myanmar, Cambodia and Lao PDR Mariam Sherman. “This will continue to test the resilience of the Myanmar people, with household incomes declining and coping mechanisms against food insecurity and poverty increasingly under strain amidst ongoing internal conflict.”, While the overall economy has faced headwinds, some sectors have stabilized or recovered over the past twelve months, driving the modest growth expected for this year. Some firms have reported operating at a higher proportion of their capacity in 2022 than was the case in 2021, particularly in the manufacturing sector, and manufactured exports are recovering. Construction activity has also picked up as work on several projects has resumed after a long pause last year, and the pipeline of issued permits has grown. A rise in mobility at workplaces, retail outlets, and transport hubs has supported overall activity, although indicators of consumer spending are weak., “Despite severe constraints, economic activity has picked up in some areas over the last twelve months, demonstrating the adaptability of Myanmar’s businesses,” said World Bank Senior Economist for Myanmar Kim Edwards. “However, industries more dependent on domestic demand are facing challenges from lower household incomes and rising prices, while agricultural production remains constrained by increased input prices, transport disruptions, and ongoing conflict”., The spike in inflation has disrupted the operations of all businesses. The latest available data indicate that CPI inflation increased to 17.3 percent (yoy) in March. Increases in global oil prices have driven pronounced increases in domestic fuel prices and transport costs, as well as in the cost of running diesel generators to compensate for recurring electricity outages. Kyat depreciation, supply chain disruptions and the spillover effects of higher transport prices have resulted in price increases for a broader range of imported inputs, squeezing already thin profit margins., Beyond the projected 3 percent growth in 2022, the outlook remains weak and subject to substantial risks. Domestic prices for food, fuel, and other imported inputs are likely to remain elevated over the short to medium term, constraining both production and consumption. The balance of payments situation is of growing concern, with U.S. dollar shortages already limiting the availability of several imported products, including fuel. Elevated levels of conflict in many areas of the country are expected to continue to constrain productive activity. As a result, a return to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity is unlikely in the near term, in sharp contrast to the rest of the East Asia and, Pacific region, where GDP in all large countries is estimated to have recovered to above 2019 levels or is projected to do so in 2023., Recent policy shifts are likely to have longer-term effects: inhibiting potential growth, worsening macroeconomic instability, and impairing the efficient allocation of resources. Trade and foreign exchange restrictions have unwound previous reforms to liberalize trade and unify the exchange rate. Stepped up promotion of import substitution and self-sufficiency is reversing much of the increased openness and liberalization that has been a key driver of Myanmar’s strong growth record over much of the last decade. These policy changes have also allowed the authorities greater control over the allocation of resources in the economy, which is likely to benefit some, but ultimately divert resources from their most efficient use. Lessons from Myanmar’s economic history suggest that to the extent that these trends continue, investor confidence and the business environment will weaken further, constraining Myanmar’s growth potential over the longer-term., PRESS RELEASE NO: 2023/006/EAP, Contacts, In Washington, Nick Keyes, +1 202 473-9135, nkeyes@worldbankgroup.org, In Bangkok, Arnold Marseille, +66 612280247, amarseille@worldbank.org",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-economic-monitor-july-2022-reforms-reversed-enmy
"Conflict-affected adolescents change their and others’ lives in Kachin, Myanmar [EN/MY]",News and Press Release,UNICEF,"Health
Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction",15 Jul 2022,"Champions of change empower young people, Ji Taung and Htet Myat Aung, both 22, live in Kachin State, the northernmost state of Myanmar, bordering China. But their life experiences have been poles apart., For the past 11 years, Ji Taung has lived in a camp for internally displaced people (IDPs) with her parents, grandparents and six brothers and sisters. Her family, like tens of thousands of others in Kachin, were uprooted due to protracted conflict., At first, Ji Taung found it hard to adapt to conditions in the camp. “It was suffocating - there were too many people,” she said. “I missed our own home where we raised cattle and farmed. But we adapted to our situation here.” However, the communal unisex bathrooms and the lack of educational opportunities have been much harder for Ji Taung and other girls living in the camp to adjust to., By contrast, Htet Myat Aung has never been displaced and lives at home with his parents and two brothers in Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin State, where his family runs a rice store. Yet in recent years, his family has been facing hardships., “We used to make enough money before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the daily price increases and security challenges worsened our situation,” said Htet Myat Aung. Moreover, like Ji Tuang, his studies were disrupted by the current crisis., “Most of the youths here feel lost and hopeless”, The huge rise in security incidents across conflict-affected states in Myanmar has been particularly catastrophic in Kachin State, coming on top of almost 50 years of conflict in the State that has left more than 97,000 people displaced. Girls are particularly at risk of early and forced marriages, trafficking, and gender-based violence, while boys are likely to be recruited into armed forces or fall into the hands of drug dealers., To support adolescents in Kachin State, UNICEF and Plan International, with funds from the Government of Canada, have started a life skills training programme called Champions of Change. The programme provides adolescents and young people like Ji Taung and Htet Myat Aung with eight weeks of curated training and ‘sharing sessions’ on topics like reproductive health, gender equality, and gender-based violence, and soft skills such as confidence building., The programme prioritises vulnerable children who cannot afford to pursue an education. Graduates of Champions of Change are given the opportunity to pursue vocational training that will prepare them to start small businesses or work in local organisations., Ji Taung and Htet Myat Aung were trained with other Champions of Change graduates for leadership roles as facilitators in peer-to-peer knowledge sharing in their community., Htet Myat Aung saw for the first time how his peers in the camps have been living, after he became a facilitator. “Unlike our wards, the camps are tightly packed with not much spare space. Each family gets only one room, and it must be unbearably hot in summer,” said Htet Myat Aung., These days Htet Myat Aung visits the camps both to facilitate sessions and to meet friends that he has made there., “I have gained the ability and courage to speak up for myself and others.”, Besides helping their peers and communities, Ji Tuang and Htet Myat Aung both say they have been empowered, too. Ji Taung recalls how she and her friends from IDP camps used to be bullied at school, and they were sometimes called ‘exiles’. “I was young and was afraid to stand up for myself,” she said., Now, Ji Tuang said, “I have gained the ability and courage to speak up for myself and others.” She also found the session on gender-based violence powerful. “We have a saying here that a husband beats his wife because he loves her too much, and I learned that it is wrong and it's just domestic violence. It has stayed in my mind ever since.”, Htet Myat Aung, too, said he has personally gained from the programme. “I used to believe females were inferior to males and that they'll never become good leaders.” He admitted that hearing about gender equality “was challenging to accept at first.” But he said, “Now, I treat everyone equally with respect.”, To date, the Champions of Change programme has benefited over 1,100 adolescents and young people from Kachin State. So far, 700 people have taken part in the vocational training, and 117 of them are now working as professionals., Since 2021, Ji Taung has been facilitating discussions with pregnant women, mothers and young people.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/conflict-affected-adolescents-change-their-and-others-lives-kachin-myanmar-enmy

Background and Context, During the latest years, the situation in Myanmar has been deteriorating with a combination of economic instability, COVID-19, escalating conflict, and a rapid and ever-increasing erosion of human rights. Consequently, the current situation is forcing increasing numbers of people to flee for their houses, sometimes taking shelter in neighboring communities and other times in jungles and forests with limited access to assistance., The Shelter/ NFI/ CCCM Cluster is led by UNHCR and has 41 partners and will strive to identify more partners nationwide to enhance coordination. This will be achieved by working with sub-national level Clusters, the Southeast Working Group and area- based approaches where appropriate to avoid the duplication of activities/services while providing a comprehensive approach to population needs. Additionally, the Cluster aims to respond to identified gaps and reach 621,000 individuals through Shelter/NFI and CCCM activities., The members of the Cluster are organizations or entities that are active in Shelter/ NFI and/or CCCM Cluster and demonstrate a commitment to carry out their accepted responsibilities within the Cluster., The Cluster aims to ensure that the coordination structures established at national, sub-national and area-levels are adapted to the context and capacities to maximize its efficiency. Coordination meetings will take place in Yangon and/or virtually at sub- national and at area levels on a monthly basis and ad hoc when needed. At sub- national and area level, activities will be coordinated according to their mechanisms with channels of communication and information sharing at the national level., During 2021, based on the new challenges and needs, the Cluster developed the Term of Reference (ToR) of the Strategic Advisory Group (SAG). Consequently, in November and December, all Cluster members were invited to apply to be part of the SAG. In January 2022, after an election process, DRC, KMSS and NRC were elected by Cluster members to form the SAG to serve as a forum at national level to provide strategic guidance, recommendations and take key strategic decisions concerning the Shelter/ NFI/ CCCM Cluster response according to its ToR.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/shelter-nfi-cccm-national-strategy-2022-2023

Health
Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",21 Jul 2022,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Bu Tho Township, Mu Traw District during the period between April and May 2022. As a result of State Administration Council (SAC) shelling, a villager’s house and other property, including a rice barn and a rice mill, were destroyed. This constant shelling created fear and resulted in the displacement of villagers. Villagers in the area have also been facing livelihood challenges as they have been afraid to tend their crops. Villagers also do not dare to use light at night these days because they are afraid that their place will be shelled or bombed if they are seen by SAC drones. Although Karen Education and Cultural Department (KECD) schools have already reopened in Bu Tho Township, villagers fear that the schools will be bombed or shelled by the SAC. Villagers, including those who have been displaced, face difficulty accessing medical care. The use of landmines by the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) and Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO) has resulted in multiple landmine incidents, including the death of one villager and injury to another.[1], State Administration Council (SAC)[2] shelling, In order to move more freely from one place to another in the area of Bu Tho Township, SAC troops have been using both big and small weapons [mortars and guns] to frighten civilians as well as the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[3]. On April 28th 2022, SAC Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[4] #407 which is under Military Operations Command (MOC)[5] #8 and led by Battalion Commander Zaw Min Htaik, launched [an unknown number of] 81 mm mortars into Htee Ber Hka Hta village, Meh Klaw village tract[6], Bu Tho Township. As a result of this shelling, the house of a villager named Saw[7] A--- was burned. Almost everything inside the house was destroyed as well., Again, on April 29th 2022, the same LIB [LIB #407] fired [an unknown number of] 81 mm mortars into Meh Nyoo Hta village [Meh Nyoo village tract, Bu Tho Township], destroying a rice barn and a rice milling machine. The owner of the property that was destroyed is Saw B---., On May 4th 2022, SAC troops based in Ku Seik, Ma Htaw village tract, fired [an unknown number of] 81 mm mortars into Day Law Poo village [Meh Klaw village tract, Bu Tho Township], killing one pig and three chickens. The owner of the pig that was killed is Saw C--- and the owner of the chickens is still unknown., During the period between April and May 2022, SAC troops constantly shelled mortars into and near villages [in Bu Tho Township], causing fear in mothers and children. Some children would shake and their hands and legs would become cold whenever they heard the sound of mortar shelling, gunfire, and military aircraft., SAC troops have not only used weapons [mortars and guns] but also used military aircraft [in their offensives], therefore, villagers have constantly lived in fear and worry since the military coup., Displacement of villagers and livelihood challenges, There are 11 village tracts in total in Bu Tho Township. During the period between April and May 2022, villagers who live in villages from three of the village tracts, Meh Klaw, Meh Nyoo, and Meh Hkuh, faced challenges as they had to flee and seek refuge in forests and along riverbanks. Although the situation in villages in other village tracts was still okay [not as critical], villagers from other villages have also lived in fear and have had to constantly stay alert., Since January 2022, villagers have been facing difficulties carrying out their livelihood activities because of the SAC military. [In the current reporting period, villagers continue to face difficulties.] Some of the villagers no longer dare to go and work on their farms because their farms are located near SAC army camps. Some villagers chose places that are far from SAC army camps for their cultivation but they are still afraid of SAC indiscriminate mortar shelling and air strikes., The SAC military also uses drones these days to take pictures of the places where villagers are hiding. Villagers are afraid to use lights at night these days because they are worried that they will be seen by SAC drones and thus, will be bombed or fired at. As a result of the livelihood challenges that villagers have been going through, villagers might face food issues in 2022-2023., Education and healthcare situation, Children have not been able to study properly due to both the COVID-19 pandemic and SAC military activities since the military coup. Karen Education and Cultural Department (KECD)[8] schools in Bu Tho Township have also reopened [since June 2022] but villagers are afraid that they will be shelled or bombed by SAC military aircrafts. As a result, we cannot say that children from those areas have freedom to study., The situation of health care varies from one village to another [in Bu Tho Township]. Since some villages are located near the local clinic, it is easier for the people from those villages to go and get medical treatment. For the villagers who live in villages that are located very far from the clinic, it is difficult for them to receive medical treatment. Due to the SAC military activities in the area [Bu Tho Township] since the military coup, villagers from many villages have fled to the forest. These displaced villagers, especially pregnant women and women with newborn babies, are really in need of medical care., Landmine incidents, [According to the community member preparing this report,] soldiers from the KNLA and the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO)[9] have been trying their best to protect villagers. One of the ways that KNLA and KNDO soldiers protect their territory and villagers is by using landmines. However, the use of landmines has created problems because villagers have often been the victims of landmine explosions. In March 2022, landmine incidents occurred twice in Bu Tho Township. In both cases, villagers stepped on landmines [planted by KNLA soldiers]. One of these villagers, a 46-year-old married man from D--- village, Meh Klaw village tract, Bu Tho Township, died while he was receiving treatment at the SAC military hospital in Hpapun Town. The victim of the other landmine explosion is Naw E---, a 47-year-old married female villager from F---village, Meh Klaw village tract. She stepped on the landmine while she was on her way to pick vegetables from one of her friends' vegetablefarm. The incident happened around 9:00 am between Way Moh and Way Hsar villages in Meh Klaw village tract. The explosion injured her in the chest. She was admitted to the Wah Hka Der clinic in KNLA Battalion #102 area, Dwe Lo Township [Mu Traw District]. [Update from July 14th 2022: Naw E--- has already recovered from her injuries, and was released from the clinic.], Further background reading on the security situation and human rights violations in Mu Traw District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in May 2022.

The chairperson serves as the de facto head of government of Burma/Myanmar and leads the Military Cabinet of Myanmar, the executive branch of the government. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of SAC chairperson following the coup., [3] The Karen National Liberation Army is the armed wing of the Karen National Union., [4] A Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) comprises 500 soldiers. However, most Light Infantry Battalions in the Tatmadaw are under-strength with less than 200 soldiers. Yet up to date information regarding the size of battalions is hard to come by. LIBs are primarily used for offensive operations, but they are sometimes used for garrison duties., [5] Military Operations Command (MOC) is comprised of ten battalions for offensive operations.

MPs denounce lack of humanitarian assistance in Myanmar ahead of International Parliamentary Inquiry’s fourth hearing,News and Press Release,APHR,Protection and Human Rights,20 Jul 2022,"JAKARTA – The Myanmar people are not receiving the humanitarian assistance they need as the crisis triggered by the coup d’état of February last year worsens, parliamentarians from seven different countries in Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe have denounced, ahead of the fourth public oral hearing of their International Parliamentary Inquiry (IPI) on the global response to the crisis in Myanmar, to be held today, 20 July., The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) puts at over 750,000 the number of people displaced by the violence perpetrated by the Myanmar military in order to cement their power since the takeover, bringing the total for the country the record number of over 1 million., Experts audited by the IPI in previous oral hearings have described a rapidly deteriorating situation, marked by a worsening economic crisis, an almost complete collapse of the health system and the systematic targeting of the civilian population by the military., “Time is rapidly running out to prevent the worst-case scenario for millions of people in Myanmar. But instead of increased attention to the situation, we are seeing the opposite: less engagement by regional and international actors, less efforts to lead the junta to the negotiation table, and a unconscionable shortfall of almost 90 percent of funding for the humanitarian needs of the country in 2022. Inaction must end now,” said Heidi Hautala, IPI Committee Chair and Vice-President of the European Parliament., According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), as of June 2022, only 11 percent of the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) for Myanmar has been funded, “negatively affecting the breadth and quality of assistance delivered by humanitarians.”, “The utter failure of ASEAN’s 5-Point Consensus should be clear to all, yet there has been no effort made to change course. Meanwhile, the international community continues to ignore evidence indicating that a primary reliance on ASEAN has not and will not result in an alleviation of the plight of the Myanmar people. Reliance on ASEAN is not a strategy, but rather a disingenuous deflection of responsibility by international actors which must stop in order for solutions to the humanitarian crisis to be found,” said Charles Santiago, IPI Committee Member, Malaysian MP, and Chair of ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR)., To address these and other issues, the IPI will hold its fourth hearing on the global response to the crisis in Myanmar on July 20, at 6 pm (Bangkok time), via Zoom., Experts who have confirmed their participation at the hearing include:, – Matthew Wells – Deputy Director, Crisis Response, Amnesty International., – Dr Ashley South – Research Fellow, Chiang Mai University., – Salai Za Uk Ling – Deputy Executive Director, Chin Human Rights Organisation (CHRO)., – Adelina Kamal -Former Executive Director for the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre), currently Associate Senior Fellow at the Yusof Ishak Institute (ISEAS)., Join the IPI Fourth Oral Hearing by Zoom by following the link: https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZ0rcOyvqjorHNeUbaXpzbMBClSV1ekKN_ci, Livestream: https://facebook.com/aseanmp, All previous hearings can be found at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbpyEyu66jrCv5HORbeIV4w/videos",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/mps-denounce-lack-humanitarian-assistance-myanmar-ahead-international-parliamentary-inquirys-fourth-hearing
Myanmar: Military’s use of banned landmines in Kayah State amounts to war crimes,News and Press Release,Amnesty,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",20 Jul 2022,"The Myanmar military is committing war crimes by laying antipersonnel landmines on a massive scale in and around villages in Kayah (Karenni) State, Amnesty International said today after an on-the-ground investigation in conflict-affected parts of the state., Antipersonnel landmines are inherently indiscriminate and their use is internationally banned. The landmines laid by the Myanmar military have killed and seriously injured civilians and will have significant long-term consequences, including on displaced people’s ability to return home and to farm their lands., “The Myanmar military’s use of landmines is abhorrent and cruel. At a time when the world has overwhelmingly banned these inherently indiscriminate weapons, the military has placed them in people’s yards, homes, and even stairwells, as well as around a church,” said Matt Wells, Amnesty International’s Crisis Response Deputy Director – Thematic Issues., “The world must urgently respond to the military’s atrocities against civilians across Myanmar. Countries around the world must cut off the flow of weapons to Myanmar and support all efforts to ensure those responsible for war crimes face justice.”, From 25 June to 8 July, Amnesty International researchers interviewed 43 people in Kayah State’s Demoso, Hpruso, and Loikaw Townships. These areas have been at the centre of fighting between the military and Karenni armed groups since May 2021, when conflict in Kayah State re-ignited following the military coup., The organization interviewed landmine survivors and other witnesses, as well as health professionals who treated landmine injuries and people who had discovered and deactivated landmines in villages. It also visited several recently demined villages., The Myanmar military is laying several types of landmines that it manufactures itself. These include the M-14, which typically blows off the victim’s foot at the ankle, and the more powerful MM-2, which often blows off the victim’s leg at the knee and causes injuries to other parts of the person’s body, with severe risk of death due to blood loss., Antipersonnel landmines, including the M-14 and MM-2, are inherently indiscriminate and their use is banned under customary international humanitarian law, as well as the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which 164 states have joined. According to Landmine Monitor, Myanmar’s military is the only state armed forces confirmed to have used antipersonnel landmines in 2020-21., Civilians killed and injured, Lu Reh, 62, and his family were displaced from Daw Thea village in Demoso Township in late February 2022 after a Myanmar military air strike killed two people in a neighbouring village. On 10 June, he and others returned to collect things from their property., As he walked along a dirt path to collect jah fruit, Lu Reh stepped on a landmine that ripped off his right leg just below the knee, leaving the bone exposed at the calf. According to a witness and another person with direct knowledge of the incident, it also wounded his left leg and right hand and caused significant blood loss. Lu Reh died on the way to the hospital., The Myanmar military has controlled that area since February 2022 and soldiers from the 66th Light Infantry Division (LID) have based themselves out of several nearby villages., The Karenni Human Rights Group (KnHRG) has documented at least 20 civilians killed or seriously injured by landmines in Kayah State since June 2021. According to activists, local aid workers, and people without formal training who have tried to demine villages, the military’s use of landmines there has soared in recent months, especially as they retreat from certain areas., In early April 2022, Rosie, 52, and her daughter Ma Thein Yar Lin, 17, were trying to return to their home in Loikaw town after being displaced by fighting in January. Rosie parked their motorbike near a rocky path, and Ma Thein Yar Lin walked a short distance away to go to the bathroom., “I heard the explosion, then I looked and saw a lot of smoke,” Rosie recalled. “I heard my daughter yelling, ‘Mama, Mama,’ and I went to look and saw her lying on the ground.”, “I noticed that my daughter had no leg anymore… I went searching for [her leg], but the man who [was passing by and stopped] to help us said, ‘Stop! There will be another landmine. The most important thing is to stop the bleeding.’”, Ma Thein Yar Lin lost her right leg from the mid-calf down and had landmine fragments throughout her left leg. She now uses a wheelchair donated by a friend. She and her mother cannot return to their home partly because the house and bathroom are not accessible., She told Amnesty International that she wants to continue her studies; she had reached Grade 11 before the Covid-19 pandemic and the coup stopped her schooling. She said she also wants to ensure her leg recovers so that she can be fitted with a quality prosthetic., Attack on a church, On 27 June 2022, Amnesty International researchers visited St Matthew’s church in Daw Ngay Khu village in Hpruso Township. The military had planted at least eight landmines on church grounds in mid-June, when there was fighting in the area., Amnesty International photographed areas where landmines had been removed, including along the main entrance path and behind the church. People involved in demining the church believed there were more landmines there that had yet to be discovered., On the afternoon of 15 June, soldiers also burned down the church and the priest’s house next door. When Amnesty International researchers visited 12 days later, the grain stored in the priest’s house was still smouldering., A 41-year-old woman from Daw Ngay Khu told Amnesty International: “That church was the centre of our village. We worried about our things [when the military started coming], so we brought them to the church to keep [them] there. We thought the Myanmar military would not attack the church, that it was a hallowed place.”, Researchers saw a discarded uniform of the 66th LID on the church grounds, along with bullet casings and a used round from a 40mm grenade launcher., Amnesty International previously implicated the 66th LID in war crimes and likely crimes against humanity in Kayah State, in a report published in June 2022., In addition to the church, Myanmar soldiers laid landmines in and near homes in Daw Ngay Khu village, according to six people who lived there as well as people who had demined parts of the village. Other areas of Daw Ngay Khu likely remain contaminated., Widespread displacement and fear, Amnesty International received credible information that the Myanmar military has laid landmines in at least 20 villages in Hpruso, Demoso, and Loikaw Townships in recent months. There are likely many more contaminated villages across Kayah and southern Shan States., The military appears to be systematically laying landmines near where it is based as well as in areas from which it retreats. The region along the main road between Moe Bye in southern Shan State and Hpruso town in Kayah State is particularly contaminated. The military systematically burned homes in the same area from February to April 2022, as Amnesty International reported previously., Soldiers have placed landmines in people’s yards, at the entrance of homes, and outside toilets. In at least one documented case, soldiers boobytrapped a house stairwell with a trip-wire improvised explosive device (IED). They have also placed landmines on paths to rice fields, and credible evidence indicates that at least one civilian was seriously injured recently from stepping on a landmine when going to their field., Displaced civilians across these areas of Kayah State told Amnesty International that fighters from ethnic armed groups had warned them about the military’s use of landmines in their villages and said they should not go back. The warnings have helped to limit civilian casualties so far, but many people are desperate to see their property and to work their fields during the planting season., Paulina, 20, a teacher from Daw Ngay Khu village, said her house was damaged by a military mortar during fighting and that soldiers then based themselves in the village. She said:, “Last year we could move back and forth and get things from our village. But this year we dare not go back… We are worried about landmines, because they plant them anywhere.”, Limited demining is overwhelmingly being undertaken by members of armed groups, who do it by hand with only rudimentary equipment and without any professional training. Contamination remains widespread., The threat to lives and livelihoods posed by landmine contamination remains an issue in other parts of Myanmar where the military has engaged in conflict with armed groups. In 2017, Amnesty International documented several incidents of landmines injuring Rohingya women, men and children along the border of Myanmar’s Rakhine State and Bangladesh., “The military’s depraved use of landmines in homes and villages will continue to have devastating effects on civilians in Kayah State for years to come. We know from bitter experience that civilian deaths and injuries will mount over time, and the widespread contamination is already blocking people from returning to their homes and farmland,” said Rawya Rageh, Senior Crisis Adviser at Amnesty International., “Myanmar’s military leadership should immediately end its use of landmines and join the majority of the world in supporting the Mine Ban Treaty, which includes provisions for demining and victim assistance. “There is an urgent need for a scaled-up humanitarian response that addresses rising food insecurity and ensures proper rehabilitative, psychosocial, and other needed care for landmine survivors, as well as adequate planning for and resourcing of post-conflict demining operations to clear contaminated areas.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-militarys-use-banned-landmines-kayah-state-amounts-war-crimes

After I left, I heard that he had been arrested., Had the bomb not exploded yet when you left?
It had already exploded. About 30 minutes after the bomb explosion, I went to Zayet Gyi village and then I heard that he had already been arrested when I arrived in Zayet Gyi village., What are the reasons that he is suspected [of involvement with the explosion]? What kind of person is he? How did they come to arrest him?
He did not have any particular things [he was not involved in any bad activities] and he was not tied to any organisations as well. He just stayed on his own. Sometimes, he also engaged in having fun like drinking. Although he likes drinking, he was also involved in doing all kinds of social work such as helping people. He was included everywhere in doing that [social work]. I do not know the reason why he was arrested. I also do not know what section of the Penal Code was applied in order to arrest him., Was he the only one arrested in D--- section [of A--- village]?
Yes, he was the only one arrested., Could his parents go with him?
His parents followed him [went to the police station] but they were unable to meet with their son., How did he die then?
How he died was that at 4:00 pm, a phone call came from Htantabin police station that they [the police] wanted to meet with his [O---’s] parents. Then, his relatives came later to the police station. However, his father was on the mountain [doing plantation work] when his son was arrested. [When his father learned that his son was arrested], his father came back [from the mountain] to go to the Htantabin police station [he was just coming back on that day but he could not go to the police station yet]. One of his [O---’s] older sisters and his uncle went to the police station. His uncle is my [the interviewee’s] father’s brother. When they arrived there at about 8:00 pm, a phone was rung [the interviewee got a phone call from his own father] and said that O--- had died. He [O---] was already at the morgue., Is it that he was arrested on the 8th and died on the 9th?
Yes, he died on the 9th but I am not sure whether he passed away in the morning or later. We just learned [that he had died] when we [the other family members] arrived at the police station., Could his parents take his body back home then?
[You mean] whether his parents could bring his body back or not? On the day when they [police] rang [his family members], I am not sure whether they [police] said they would return the body to [his family members] or not, or whether they [police] just phoned [his family members] to sign and release him. [The police did not say why they were calling, just told them to come to the police station]. We just learned that he had died after we [the other family members] arrived there., Do you know anyone who is responsible for arrests in the police?
Yes, I know some of them. It is the [local] police station where they work., Could you please tell me the names of the police officers?
[I heard that] the names of the [local] police officers are Yar Zar Gyi, and the other one is Lin Han Htun. [These local officers accompanied the SAC soldiers and police officers from Htantabin for the arrest.], Do these police officers live in A--- village?
Yes, they were assigned to A--- police station. The other one, Lin Han Htun, married a A--- villager., Have they been assigned to duty in A--- village, currently?
They have currently relocated; they were re-assigned to Htantabin police station., Does he [O---] have any conflicts with anyone?
He does not have any conflicts. He only drinks [alcohol]. He does not do such kind of things [bad things/get in trouble]., O--- was arrested and he passed away the next day. How about you? Do you feel secure [after this incident]? How does O---’s family carry on?
O---’s parents are currently still at the mountain [only his father had previously come to the police station]. His mother does not even know that he has died yet. I am not sure whether she was informed or not. His father and sister already know about it. Currently, we have to avoid the situation [avoid drawing attention to ourselves]. I am not sure whether I will be arrested sooner or later but I have to stay away from that [he is worried that he will also be accused of involvement in the bomb explosion]., So, it is likely they will accuse you even though you did not commit any crime and were not involved in the explosion of the bomb, isn’t it like that?
Exactly, it is like that. They came to arrest him because of the bomb explosion., Do you know who was involved in the explosion of the bomb?
I do not know who was involved in the explosion of bomb., What else do you want to say? You can say whatever you want to.
Even if I talk about this, they [unclear who he is referring to] will not know about it., What I mean is, what do you want to say regarding this incident?
As a brother has died, various feelings affect me. It is hard for me to control my emotions because I am sad hearing about the death of my cousin. I cannot do anything, like go and help with his funeral as I also have had to flee., In that case, it is not possible to bring back the body. Did they [SAC police and soldiers] bury the body by themselves?
For the burial, I am not sure who did it. I heard that he has already buried at Htantabin., The brother who died is O---, right? How old was he?
He was 27 years old., What was his address?
He lived just inside D--- section in A--- village., Thank you for the interview.

10 years in dire conditions perpetuates severe mental health problems for Rohingya,News and Press Release,MSF,Health,14 Jul 2022,"In 2012, when violence erupted between Rohingya and Rakhine communities, Zaw Rina’s home in Pauktaw town was burned down. She was forced to flee with her family to a camp in Ah Nauk Ywe, on an island in the remote western part of the state. The impermanence of the fragile bamboo structure she lives in now belies the decade she has spent in the camp., Flimsy shelter next to flimsy shelter line narrow, muddy pathways through the overcrowded camps in which more than 5,000 people live. Drainage is insufficient, with puddles of stagnant water a breeding ground for mosquitos and disease. There are too many people for too few toilets, while low water supplies, particularly in the dry season, means the facilities are typically filthy. Privacy is almost impossible to find., Violence in 2012 that saw Zaw Rina’s home destroyed and killed hundreds, drove some 140,000 people, both Rohingya and Kaman Muslims, into these camps. Most remain there today where they have limited freedom of movement, denying them access to paid work, education and healthcare. Many embark on perilous journeys over sea and land to Bangladesh and Malaysia in the hope of a better life., The impact on mental health, The day-to-day existence for Zaw Rina and thousands of others like her living in Rakhine state is underlined by fear, struggles to afford food, and feelings of hopelessness. This protracted status quo has drastic consequences on mental health., The stress of living in these conditions was compounded when Zaw Rina’s 20-year-old daughter attempted suicide after her husband asked for a divorce., “She was having a lot of serious fights with her mother-in-law and her husband turned around and said ‘I don’t like you and I want to get divorced, I did not marry you because I loved you’,” says Zaw Rina., Across Myanmar, there are huge gaps in mental healthcare services. Rakhine state is no different, leaving people like Zaw Rina and her daughter with few options. There is one dedicated private mental health clinic in Sittwe, but it is too expensive for most people, while psychiatry services at the public hospital are hugely limited., Exacerbating their challenges, the city is some 10 kilometres across the Kaladan River from the camps in Pauktaw township - both the distance and movement restrictions make it incredibly difficult for Rohingya living in camps to even reach these facilities., Through our clinics in the camps, we are able to come to Rohingya to provide vital mental healthcare support, with counsellors and doctors offering one-on-one appointments, group sessions and home visits. These services are available to anyone who comes to our facilities, no matter their ethnicity or religion., Both Zaw Rina and her daughter received counselling from MSF, helping them better manage their symptoms. “I really felt lost and didn’t know where to ask for help until I met with the [MSF] counsellor,” she says. “I am feeling better now in terms of my mental health, a lot better, and for my daughter too.”, Struggling to earn an income from Sittwe’s ghetto, Although Daw Than Than was born to Buddhist parents in Mandalay, she married a Kaman Muslim, changed her religion and now lives together with Rohingya and Kaman in Aung Mingalar, a Muslim ghetto in the centre of Sittwe., This is where the remnants of Sittwe’s Muslims, which used to number almost half the city’s 200,000 residents, live. The rest fled during the violence in 2012 or were forced into camps like the one where Zaw Rina lives. For 10 years, Muslims in downtown Sittwe have been confined to this small neighbourhood, denied freedom to move and with police outposts guarding it day and night., Daw Than Than is widowed. She has no children or family to support her. When she can, she cooks and cleans in people’s homes. But unable to come and go from the neighbourhood she often struggles to earn an income. Although movement restrictions into and out of the ghetto have eased in the past year, allowing her to move around Sittwe, her physical health worsened, preventing her from working., “I feel sad because I struggle alone in my life. I feel lonely and sad because I have no one to support me when I feel sick. I can’t afford to go to a private hospital,” she says, adding how she does not have enough money to eat properly, often subsisting on rice and green tea., Every Friday, MSF opens a clinic in Aung Mingalar where people from within the ghetto come to receive basic healthcare, mental health support and treatment for non-communicable diseases. “When I speak [to MSF counsellors], I feel some relief. They help me with breathing exercises, which are really helpful for relaxing. During counselling sessions, I cannot control my feelings though, and I cry,” says Daw Than Than, Violence exacerbating Rohingya women’s mental health, The challenging, stressful conditions in which Rohingya are detained in cramped camps, with limited economic opportunities and reliant on humanitarian assistance leaves women and girls at greater risk of abuse, sexual harassment and domestic violence., Khin Phyu Oo first came to MSF’s Sin Thet Maw clinic after having a seizure. When staff from the clinic told her to be careful around the stove when she is cooking because of her condition, her husband was frustrated she could not do her house chores and beat her. This was one of a number of incidents of her husband attacking her, which left her feeling suicidal. This was when she began to receive counselling from MSF, alongside her seizure treatment., “I have no one to open up to [in the community]. Nobody wants to listen to me. I am happy to come here and say everything that is on my mind,” she said., “I feel happier. I think getting treatment is good for me. I can open up to the doctors here and they motivate me, give me suggestions [about how to make myself feel better]. The doctors also gave my husband mental health education.”, Overcoming the root causes of mental health, Rohingya will continue to struggle with their mental health while the root causes of their distress remain unresolved., “I have hope my children can get an education one day,” says Zaw Rina., “And I want a good shelter so I can live a normal and enjoyable life, like I had back in Pauktaw town. When I lived in my own house, I felt secure.”, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been working in Myanmar since 1992, assisting people affected by conflict and struggling to access healthcare. Today, over 1,000 staff provide basic healthcare, HIV, hepatitis C and tuberculosis treatment, and referrals to hospitals for emergency and specialised treatment across Kachin, Rakhine, Shan, Tanintharyi and Yangon states and regions. In Rakhine, MSF teams support communities displaced by conflict, including Rakhine Buddhists, and Rohingya and Kaman Muslims.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/10-years-dire-conditions-perpetuates-severe-mental-health-problems-rohingya

Since February 2021, the RTG estimates that over 21,000 Myanmar refugees have sought temporary safety in Thailand., Refugees are sheltered in temporary safety areas (TSA), which are placed under the general jurisdiction of the Royal Thai Army by the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) established by the RTG in March 2021., SITUATION OVERVIEW ON THE THAI MYANMAR BORDER, The security situation continues to deteriorate in Southeast Myanmar with the intensification of armed clashes reported between the Tatmadaw and ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) or People's Defence Force (PDF) in several areas. The Military continues to deploy security forces and has increased the use of heavy artilleries. In Kayah State, armed clashes continue, and the State Administration Council(SAC) has been deploying more troops to the area since mid-May. According to the Tagaung Institute of Political Studies and the US-based Wilson Center, there are more than 20,000 resistance fighters in Karenni State, In Kayin State, fierce clashes have been ongoing between the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) and the Tatmadaw following a KNLA attack on a military outpost in Myawaddy Township on 26 June. The battle for control over the outpost is the fiercest fighting that has taken place since last year. In neighboring Mon State, around 7,000 residents from six villages in Thaton Township fled their homes due to arson attacks carried out by security forces, the first time such attacks have taken place in the state., In the Tanintharyi region, The People’s Defense Force (PDF), KNU, and the Tatmadaw continue to clash, with the latter pressuring the former with logistic hindrances (e.g., road blockage). Since June 24, around 100 military council troops have been entering the area from Kazina village to Sipin Taung, Myanadi Taung. Fighting was occurring mostly in Dawei and Myeik District and scaled up with the Military using heavy artillery throughout the night., As of 30 June, the total number of internally displaced people (IDPs) in Myanmar displaced since 1 February is 758,500, of whom 244,500 are in the southeast provinces – Kayah, Shan, Kayin, Mon States, and Tanintharyi and Bago regions. In Kayah State, more than 4,000 people were able to return to Loikaw and Demoso Townships.

After the State Administration Council (SAC) Infantry Battalion (IB) #267 fired mortars into K--- village, The Chaung Gyi village tract, Taung Pyauk Taik area, K’Ser Doh Township on March 30th 2022, they entered the village and arrested, tortured and interrogated several villagers. After that incident, villagers there were afraid and went to stay in other places.

According to U A---, a village head who was appointed by the National Unity Government (NUG)[6], the SAC conducted shelling [into the village] because of the opening of an NUG-administered school [no prior warning about the shelling was given, nor were there any threats or warnings about opening a new school]. People who were affected by this were villagers. The shelling was conducted during the time when villagers, who are day labourers, were working in the village., After the shelling, the SAC soldiers [from IB #267] entered the village. When the SAC soldiers entered the village, they arrested some villagers. According to U B---, who was among the arrested villagers, “During the interrogation, they tortured me very badly. They asked me questions, punched me, kicked me, and I could not move any part of my body because they tied me tightly. It’s a serious violation of my rights. I escaped the day before they planned to kill me. Is the international community just going to stay and watch while civilians have to go through things like this? Is there no longer anything they can do to help us?” Due to this kind of SAC military activity, villagers were afraid to stay in their village. Some villagers went to stay in C--- monastery, while others went to stay in D--- village, Kyaw Khay Toh Praw area, K’Ser Doh Township. Some villagers went to stay with their relatives in other places and some stayed in the forest., SAC extortion, Since March 2022, SAC soldiers at roadside checkpoints have been demanding 450 kyats [USD 0.24][7] for each viss [1.6 kg or 3.52 lb] of betel nut that villagers sell [the average selling price of one viss of betel nut is 3,500 kyats (USD 1.89)], and villagers had to give them [SAC soldiers] half a litre of oil when they bought one litre. Villagers had to give whatever they were asked to give out of fear.

Saw O--- has not been released yet, and his family members did not receive any information about him [at first]. Later, the villagers and his family heard that the commander of BGF Battalion #1014 gave an order for the execution of H--- villager, Saw O---. [However, at the time of publication, neither his family nor the other villagers have received any further information, so it is unclear if he has already been executed or if an execution date has been set.], Threats and physical assault by SAC troops, On January 2nd 2022, Saw Maw Nee, a corporal from BGF Battalion #1014, who is based in Meh Pree army camp, took drugs and threatened three villagers [whom he encountered] from E--- village, Meh Pree village tract, Bu Tho Township, by indiscriminately firing about 30 rounds from an ArmaLite Rifle (AR).

Villagers from the nearby villages, including B--- village, Day Wah village tract, Bu Tho Township, were also very afraid. They hid inside their bunkers the whole day and did not get to eat anything., On January 23rd 2022, SAC soldiers [battalion unidentified] and BGF soldiers from Battalion #1014 who were in Htee Th’Daw Hta village tract, Bu Tho Township threatened the villagers by firing five rounds of M79 grenades and approximately 60 rounds from a small gun. This kind of indiscriminate firing has created fear among the villagers., On January 24th 2022, SAC soldiers who were on duty in Hpapun Town, Dwe Lo Township, indiscriminately fired mortars into Section 2 of Hpapun Town, and it [a fragment of one of the mortars] hit a 47-year-old man, N---.

Local villagers were very afraid, not only in Bu Tho Township, but also in Dwe Lo Township. Some villagers went to sleep in the forest because SAC military aircraft had been conducting reconnaissance missions in the local area [of Bu Tho Township] every day and night since January 10th 2022 [and continued as of March 2022]., During the night of January 11th 2022, an SAC military aircraft dropped a bomb in Ma Htaw village, Htee Th’Bluh Hta village tract, Dwe Lo Township. Some of the schools [in the area] had to close for a few days due to this activity by SAC military aircraft. It was mostly the schools with a large number of students and those that are located close to the KNU’s offices that had to close., On January 29th 2022, an SAC military aircraft conducted a reconnaissance mission in Meh Hkah Hta area, Bu Tho Township. The researcher [providing this update] received news that the SAC were coming to drop off food for their troops in Ler Toh army camp., Again, at around 2:15 am on January 31st 2022, the SAC conducted an airstrike at the headquarters of the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO)[12] Battalion #1 in Thee Kaw Hta village, Pah Heh village tract, Bu Tho Township. Some of the buildings and properties [villagers’ houses in Thee Kaw Hta] were destroyed, but no one was injured in this attack. Four bombs during this attack. Although the target of the air strike was not the village itself, but the KNDO headquarters inside the village, villagers [in Pah Heh village tract] were very afraid and these days, they are living in fear., On January 29th 2022, BGF Battalion #1015, together with SAC soldiers [from an unknown battalion] began operating in an area between K’Ter Tee and K’ser Ther Pler army camps, located in Dwe Lo Township, and they indiscriminately fired mortars into Htee Law Thee Hta village, Htee Th’Bluh Hta village tract, Dwe Lo Township. The attack resulted in civilian casualties, including children., Since aircraft from the SAC have been conducting reconnaissance in the local area [Bu Tho Township] every day and night since January 2022, villagers have been living in fear. On January 29th 2022, an SAC military aircraft came to conduct a reconnaissance mission in the local area of Bu Tho Township three times., Landmine incident, Landmine contamination in local areas has always been a major risk for the villagers living in Mu Traw District. Villagers whose livelihoods depend on working in their fields live in fear due to the presence of landmines and previous landmine incidents. [At about 2:55 pm on January 9th 2022, a villager from Meh Klaw village tract stepped on a landmine outside his village sustaining serious injuries in the explosion. Local villagers were warned by the KNLA, who had planted the landmine, about the possibility of landmine contamination in the village vicinity. However, the landmine victim needed to forage in the nearby forest to secure a livelihood for his family. Following the incident, the villager was taken to the Military Operations Command (Byu Ha) Hospital in Hpapun Town for treatment but passed away after he arrived.[13]] This kind of incident makes it difficult for the villagers to continue working in their fields and forage for vegetables in the forest to secure their livelihood., Further background reading on the security situation and human rights abuses in Mu Traw District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, Footnotes:, 1] The present document is based on information received in January and March 2022.

"Atrocity Alert No. 308: Myanmar (Burma), Children and Armed Conflict and Syria",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,13 Jul 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., MYANMAR’S MILITARY USING SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY TO MAINTAIN POWER, Myanmar’s (Burma) military – the Tatmadaw – is planning to install surveillance camera systems with facial recognition capabilities in cities across all of the country’s seven states and seven regions, according to an 11 July report by Reuters. The military claims the projects will help maintain security and foster civil peace. However, recent reporting indicates that the military will increasingly rely upon surveillance technology in an attempt to strengthen its hold on power and oppose resistance efforts. This poses heightened safety risks for activists and resistance groups, including by making it easier for the military to track their movements., Prior to the February 2021 military coup, some surveillance camera systems were already installed or planned in several major cities, including Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyidaw. Local authorities have initiated new camera surveillance projects in at least five cities around Myanmar, including Mawlamyine, the country’s fourth-largest city; Taunggyi, the capital of Shan State; and Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin State. Local firms are sourcing the cameras and other related technology from Chinese companies – Dahua, Huawei and Hikvision – that are tied to the surveillance of the ethnic Uyghur population in China., The surveillance cameras are part of a wider effort to monitor the activities of populations in Myanmar. Last month four UN experts condemned the military’s attempts to establish a “digital dictatorship” in Myanmar with tactics like sweeping internet blackouts, digital censorship and surveillance. According to the experts, telecommunications providers have been pressured to activate surveillance technology and hand over user data to police and military officials., Since August 2021 at least 31 townships in seven states and regions across Myanmar have reportedly experienced internet shutdowns, and an additional 23 have faced severely slowed internet speeds. The internet shutdowns have targeted areas where the military faces strong resistance from opposition groups. The UN experts said, “online access to information is a matter of life and death for many people in Myanmar, including those seeking safety from indiscriminate attacks by the military.” Notably, the imposition of internet blackouts in Sagaing Region coincided with the escalation of a military offensive characterized by arson and airstrike campaigns against civilian areas., The UN experts also noted that “internet restrictions are being used by the junta as a cloak to hide its ongoing atrocities.” The barriers to internet access and lack of connectivity in many parts of the country are hindering the collection of evidence of possible war crimes and crimes against humanity by human rights monitors and journalists., The military in Myanmar must respect the population’s right to privacy. Member states should support civil society efforts to combat censorship and surveillance and impose sanctions to restrict the sale or supply of dual-use surveillance technology., THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN FACING GRAVE VIOLATIONS IN CONFLICT ZONES, The UN Secretary-General’s annual report on children and armed conflict was released on Monday, 11 June, documenting 23,982 verified “grave violations” against children in 21 countries, plus the Lake Chad Basin region, during 2021. Many of the grave violations against children outlined in the report – including killing and maiming, sexual violence, recruitment and use in hostilities, and attacks against schools or hospitals – constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity. More than 8,000 children were killed or maimed, 6,310 recruited and used in combat, over 1,320 subjected to sexual violence and nearly 3,500 abducted in 2021. Both abductions and sexual violence against children increased by 20 percent from 2020., The majority of these violations were perpetrated in countries where mass atrocities are ongoing or have recently been perpetrated, including in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. The Lake Chad Basin had the most significant increase of girls affected by grave violations, including killing and maiming, abduction and sexual violence. The report designated Ethiopia, Mozambique and Ukraine as “situations of concern,” and requested enhanced monitoring of the Central Sahel., Since the UN’s Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM) for children and armed conflict was established, the Secretary-General’s annual report and its annex have been a useful tool for “naming and shaming” known perpetrators. However, several offending parties were once again excluded from the report’s annexes despite UN-verified evidence of their responsibility for grave violations against children. Notably, the government of Israel was omitted despite Israeli security forces killing 78 Palestinian children and maiming another 982, the most casualties caused by a single perpetrator in 2021. The annex also failed to include the Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates-led international coalition in Yemen despite evidence that its forces killed or maimed 100 children., Virginia Gamba, UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, said that, “there is no word strong enough to describe the horrific conditions that children in armed conflict have endured… But we must not let these numbers discourage our efforts. They should serve as an impetus to reinforce our determination to end and prevent grave violations against children.”, All UN member states should implement the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Paris Principles, the Vancouver Principles, and abide by the Safe Schools Declaration. At the upcoming debate on children and armed conflict, UN Security Council members should insist on a single, complete list of perpetrators that is evidence-based and accurately reflects data collected and verified by the MRM. It is imperative that all perpetrators of grave violations against children be held to the same standard., FOLLOWING RUSSIAN VETO, UN SECURITY COUNCIL RENEWS CROSS-BORDER AID FOR SYRIA, Yesterday, 12 July, the UN Security Council (UNSC) passed a resolution re-authorizing cross-border humanitarian aid deliveries through the Bab al-Hawa crossing on the Syrian-Turkish border for six months. Ireland and Norway, co-penholders of Resolution 2642, emphasized that the six-month renewal is far shorter than what is required to meet current humanitarian needs and that the mandate will now expire during brutal winter months, a critical time for aid deliveries. Ahead of the mandate’s expiration, UN Secretary-General António Guterres emphasized that a 12-month renewal is a “moral imperative.” The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs highlighted that a 12-month renewal of cross-border aid deliveries would be “critical for the lives and wellbeing of 4.1 million people trapped in the non-government-controlled northwest of Syria bordering Türkiye.” Bab al-Hawa is currently the only point through which crucial aid is allowed to be delivered to people in northern Syria., Prior to yesterday’s vote, the existing cross-border mandate expired on 10 July because the UNSC was unable to reach consensus. On 8 July the draft resolution attempted to renew the Bab al-Hawa crossing for 12 months. It received 13 votes in favor and Russia vetoed the draft., The UNSC first authorized cross-border deliveries in 2014, creating four points through which humanitarian aid could be delivered by road from Türkiye, Iraq and Jordan. Most Council members support the cross-border mechanism, recognizing that these operations are critical for addressing the scope of humanitarian needs in Syria. However, Russia – a close ally of the Syrian government – and China have routinely expressed that aid should be delivered across domestic frontlines from government-held areas to people living in areas outside government control. In 2020, due to Russian pressure and several joint vetoes with China, the UNSC reduced the number of cross-border delivery points from four to one., Following Russia’s 8 July veto, the UN General Assembly is scheduled to hold a session on Syria on 21 July in accordance with Resolution 76/262. During this meeting, the wider UN membership should explore more sustainable and efficient avenues to ensure that critical humanitarian aid reaches all Syrians in need throughout the country, as well as address the challenges inherent in the UNSC.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-308-myanmar-burma-children-and-armed-conflict-and-syria
Myanmar: Urgent Needs for Displaced Communities in Southern Shan,News and Press Release,ICRC,"Food and Nutrition

Protection and Human Rights",13 Jul 2022,"Shan State in Myanmar is home to many diverse communities., It is the largest state in the country, bordering China to the north, Laos to the east and Thailand to the south. But for decades, this beautiful land has experienced ongoing clashes leading to waves of displacement., While long-term displacement in the north exacerbates vulnerability both to conflict and COVID-19, newly displaced communities in the south also need urgent humanitarian support., ""I lost everything,"" says Daw Nu Rai*, a mother of five children who now lives in Hsi Hseng, southern Shan. ""We've been displaced for a year now. We couldn't sleep properly till we arrived at this camp three months ago."", Following intense clashes in Kayah State, several thousand people from Loikaw, Demoso, Hpruso and Pekon were forced to leave their homes and seek refuge in southern Shan State. ""I didn't know what to do first when the fighting started. I have five children who depend on me,"" says Daw Nu Rai., Some undertook their journey by car, some took trucks and others rode motorbikes as they left their homes behind. ""We tried to fit four people on one bike when we crossed the Shan and Kayah border. It took us about 12 hours to reach a place that we felt safe in,"" Daw Nu Rai says., When people are forced from their homes by conflict, they often have to leave almost everything behind. They arrive at sites of temporary shelter without daily household items like soap, water filters or a roof overhead -- things all too easily take for granted. Many rely on the hospitality of temporary host communities in monasteries, churches or the homes of relatives., ""They have gone through so much over the past months. I can't even imagine the physical and mental trauma that they are going through right now,"" says Daw Myint* from one such displacement site in Hsi Hseng. As a member of the host community, she has been helping to care for the displaced people from Kayah State., With multiple generations of a family -- children to grandparents -- displaced together, there is a range of humanitarian needs within the community., ""Every weekend we try to conduct psychosocial support sessions for adults, where we listen to their stories of trauma and comfort them,"" says Daw Myint., While dealing with conflict trauma is always challenging, it can be even more difficult for children who are still learning and growing. ""We organize playtime and lessons for children to help them refocus their mind and slowly process what is going on around them, at their own pace,"" says Daw Myint, Alongside the hospitality of the host communities, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been working with the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) to support people displaced by violence in Pin Laung and Hsi Hseng and provide emergency aid., ""We recently completed our second trip to Hsi Hseng and Pin Laung. Together with the MRCS, we were able to provide rice, peas, oil and salt to nearly 2000 families to ensure that they don't go hungry,"" says Martin Samtan from the ICRC Lashio team., Beyond emergency assistance, we shared life-saving information about landmines and other explosive hazards that continue to be a risk to all communities. We also shared our ICRC hotline number to help people connect with loved ones separated by clashes or displacement., Our teams are still on the ground, working with communities affected by conflict, alongside the MRCS, to identify and respond to those most urgent needs., *Name changed",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-urgent-needs-displaced-communities-southern-shan

As of 4 July, an estimated 1,116,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) were reported, including some 769,000 people who have been displaced within Myanmar since 1 February 2021., In the North-West, ongoing fighting continued to undermine the safety and security of civilians with sporadic clashes reported in Chin State and Magway and Sagaing regions., In the South-East, armed clashes generated some displacement largely due to the deteriorating security situation in Mon State, Bago (East) and Tanintharyi regions. Humanitarian access remained challenging although new displacement and IDP returns to areas of origin continues to be monitored. In protracted situations, many IDPs face acute food and supply shortages, which have been exacerbated by a shortage of essential goods and services in the host community., In Kachin and Shan (North), IDPs’ limited access to financial services continued to undermine their capacity to engage in sustainable livelihoods. Access to education was another challenge, particularly in Kachin and Shan (North) as a result of school closures in response to COVID-19 and security-related measures. Other challenges facing children and adolescents include forced recruitment and child marriage., In Rakhine State, simmering tensions spilled over into clashes in Chin State’s Paletwa Township on 27 June. The abduction of two teachers in Maungdaw (North) also heightened existing anxieties within communities. The evolving situation stands to impact the already limited freedom of movement for the Rohyinga communities, further impeding access to services and social cohesion.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-emergency-update-6-july-2022

Equity assessment of childhood immunisation at national and subnational levels in Myanmar: a benefit incidence analysis,Analysis,BMJ,Health,8 Jul 2022,"Zin Mar Win, Tom Traill, Zarni Lynn Kyaw, Khaing Thandar Hnin, Phway Thinzar Chit, Thazin La, Ashwini Sunil Deshpande, Osondu Ogbuoji, Wenhui Mao, Abstract, Introduction, Myanmar, a conflict-affected geographically and ethnically diverse lower middle-income country, was in the donor transition phase for health prior to the political unrest of the last year. This study analyses the distribution of benefit and utilisation of basic childhood vaccinations from the highly donor-dependent Expanded Program on Immunization for populations of different socioeconomic status (SES)., Methods, We conducted a benefit incidence analysis with decomposition analysis to assess the equity of benefit. We used basic childhood immunisations—BCG, measles, diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT)/pentavalent, oral polio vaccine (OPV) and full vaccination—as measurements for healthcare use. Childhood immunisation data were collected from Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey. Cost of vaccines was obtained from UNICEF document and ‘Immunization Delivery Cost Catalogue’ and adjusted with regional cost variations. We reported Concentration Index (CI) and Achievement Index (AI) by SES, including wealth quintiles, maternal education and across geographic areas., Results, Nationally, better-off households disproportionately used more services from the programme (CI–Wealth Index (CI-WI) for BCG, measles, DPT/pentavalent, OPV and full immunisation: 0.032, 0.051, 0.120, 0.091 and 0.137, respectively). Benefits had a pro-poor distribution for BCG but a less pro-rich distribution than utilisation for all other vaccines (CI-WI: −0.004, 0.019, 0.092, 0.045 and 0.106, respectively). Urban regions had a more pro-rich distribution of benefit than that in rural areas, where BCG and measles had a pro-poor distribution. Subnational analysis found significant heterogeneity: benefit was less equitably distributed, and AI was lower in conflict-affected states than in government-controlled areas. The major contributors to vaccine inequality were SES, antenatal care visits and paternal education., Conclusion, Donors, national government and regional government should better plan to maintain vaccine coverage while improving equity of vaccine services, especially for children of lower SES, mothers with less antenatal care visits and lower paternal education living in conflicted-affected remote regions., Read the full report here",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/equity-assessment-childhood-immunisation-national-and-subnational-levels-myanmar-benefit-incidence-analysis

Protection and Human Rights",8 Jul 2022,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Dwe Lo and Bu Tho Townships, Mu Traw District between January and February 2022. In January and February 2022, the State Administration Council (SAC) and the Border Guard Force (BGF) indiscriminately shelled and bombed several villages in Dwe Lo Township, killing three villagers, injuring a further 14, and prompting locals to flee. The attacks also destroyed civilian property, including houses and livelihood areas. SAC forces continued to hunt down perceived opponents. They arbitrarily arrested nine people from Hpapun Town for allegedly leading anti-regime protests. In early February, 16 people fled Hpapun Town and another 6 from a nearby village after they were accused of being connected to People's Defence Forces (PDF).[1], Mortar shelling, On the night of January 17th 2022, State Administration Council (SAC)[2] soldiers from Maw Loh Kloh army camp fired mortars into Lay Hpoh Hta village, Lay Hpoh Hta village tract[3], Dwe Lo Township. At 6:00 pm on January 29th 2022, SAC troops and Border Guard Force (BGF)[4] Battalion #1013, which is led by Deputy Battalion Commander Kyaw Win, fired mortar shells from Ka Ser Ther Hpler army camp (Taung Thon Lo army camp) into Htee Law Thee Hta village, Htee Th’Bluh Hta village tract, Dwe Lo Township. [No villagers were injured in these two incidents.], On February 5th 2022, at 3:00 pm, SAC Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[5] #434 fired mortars at Kyaw Hklee Loh village, Ma Htaw village tract, Dwe Lo Township, injuring one villager. At 3:00 pm on February 12th 2022, SAC LIB #341 fired two mortar rounds into Hkler Hkoh village, Ma Htaw village tract, Dwe Lo Township. The shelling destroyed two houses and a rice barn, killed a dog, and injured one villager. From 7:15 to 7:30 pm on February 16th 2022, SAC LIB #341 fired mortars into Hkler Hkoh village again. The mortar shells landed on Pu Y’Thit monastery and destroyed a clock as well as other property in the monastery., At around 9:42 pm on February 16th 2022, BGF Battalion #1013 from Ka Ser Ther Hpler army camp shelled mortars into Hpway Htaw Roo village, Htee Th’Bluh Hta village tract, Dwe Lo Township. On February 18th 2022, the same battalion fired mortar shells into Hpway Htaw Roo village again, damaging two houses. On February 24th 2022, BGF Battalion #1013 also fired mortars into K’Pee Hkee village, Htee Th’Bluh Hta village tract, killing one villager and injuring six or seven others - two of which were critically injured. Twelve houses were also destroyed., Air strikes, At 1:00 am on January 4th 2022, three SAC military jets conducted an air strike (each jet dropping one bomb) on Wah Hka Der village, Meh Thuh village tract, Dwe Lo Township. At around 2:05 am on January 12th 2022, two SAC military jets dropped two bombs (total) on Wah Hka Der village again, destroying a Karen Department of Health and Welfare (KDHW) clinic and one latrine. This suggests that the SAC targets civilians [rather than legitimate military targets, in violation of international humanitarian law]., At around 1:00 am on February 5th 2022, the SAC conducted another air strike on T’Dwee Hkoh village, Ma Htaw village tract, Dwe Lo Township. The air strike killed two people (husband and wife), injured six other villagers, and destroyed four houses. At 2:00 am on February 18th 2022, three SAC military jets carried out air strikes on Khaw Klah, Htwee Thee Auh, and Ler Ghay Hta villages, Ma Htaw village tract, Dwe Lo Township. The attack destroyed one farm in Khaw Klah village. Villagers can no longer work on that particular farm because of the damage. In Htwee Thee Auh and Ler Ghay Hta villages, the bombs landed on and destroyed local villagers’ plantations. The same day at 2:00 pm, the SAC also launched an air strike on Nah Koh Hkee village, Nah Koh Hkee village tract, Dwe Lo Township, damaging the villagers’ betel trees and farms., Landmine incident, At 3:00 pm on February 7th 2022, a 31-year-old woman with an intellectual disability from Way Mone village, Meh Klaw village tract, Bu Tho Township, was killed in a landmine explosion while she was walking in a forest near her village. [The incident happened near a road that is commonly used by local villagers.], Threats and arrests by the SAC, On February 6th 2022, six people fled from Way Hsar village, Meh Klaw village tract, Bu Tho Township, and 13 people fled from Section #2, Hpapun Town [all were accused of being connected to People’s Defence Forces (PDFs)[6], presumably by military informants]. Among the six villagers who fled from Way Hsar, four were men and two were women. On February 12th 2022, another three people from Section #2 fled from Hpapun Town because the SAC accused them of being connected to the PDF. The SAC also arrested nine people in Hpapun Town [for allegedly leading anti-regime protests], and only one of them has reportedly been released [KHRG was not able to obtain more information regarding this specific case, but the arrests took place during the reporting period]., Displacement of villagers, Due to the SAC air strikes and mortar shelling, some villagers from Ma Htaw, Htee Th’Bluh Hta, K’Ter Tee, and Lay Hpoh Hta village tracts, Dwe Lo Township have been displaced. In Bu Tho Township, villagers from Peh Klaw, Meh Nyoh, Meh Hkoo, Meh Mweh, Day Wah, and Kyaw Pah village tracts have also been displaced [KHRG was not able to establish the exact number of displaced villagers]., Livelihood challenges, Villagers from the above-mentioned village tracts have been living in fear and facing livelihood challenges since the beginning of 2022 because they are afraid that the SAC might conduct air strikes on their villages, and that SAC and BGF soldiers from nearby army camps might shell their communities [the villagers remain on permanent alert and are afraid to conduct their daily activities, such as tending to their crops as usual]., Further background reading on the human rights and security situation in Mu Traw District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, “Mu Traw District Short Update: SAC troops fired mortars into a village, killing seven villagers and injuring four, March 2022”, March 2022., “Mu Traw District Incident Report: A villager died due to a landmine explosion in Bu Tho Township, January 2022”, February 2022., “Mu Traw District Situation Update: Human rights violations including looting, killing, arbitrary arrest and torture, and the burning of houses and villages, April to July 2021”, January 2022., “Mu Traw District Incident Report: Torture of three villagers in Dwe Lo Township by an SAC officer, August 2021”, January 2022., Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in February 2022.

Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of SAC chairperson following the coup., [3] A village tract is an administrative unit of between five and 20 villages in a local area, often centred on a large village., [4] Border Guard Force (BGF) battalions of the Tatmadaw were established in 2010, and they are composed mostly of soldiers from former non-state armed groups, such as older constellations of the DKBA, which have formalised ceasefire agreements with the Burma/Myanmar government and agreed to transform into battalions within the Tatmadaw., [5] A Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) comprises 500 soldiers. Most Light Infantry Battalions in the Tatmadaw are under-strength with less than 200 soldiers, yet up-to-date information regarding the size of battalions is hard to come by, particularly following the signing of the NCA. LIBs are primarily used for offensive operations, but they are sometimes used for garrison duties., [6] The People’s Defence Force (PDF) is an armed resistance established independently as local civilian militias operating across the country. Following the February 1st 2021 military coup and the ongoing brutal violence enacted by the junta, the majority of these groups began working with the National Unity Government (NUG), a body claiming to be the legitimate government of Myanmar, which then formalized the PDF on May 5th 2021 as a precursor to a federal army.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/mu-traw-district-situation-update-sac-air-strikes-and-indiscriminate-shelling-villages-dwe-lo-township-kill-three-and-injure-least-14-civilians-january-february-2022

The Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) continues to be supported by many in Myanmar, impacting public services, including health, schools, and government administrations in states and regions across the country., Clashes and targeted attacks between various armed actors, including the People’s Defence Forces (PDFs), ethnic armed organizations (EAOs), and the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF), continue and have intensified in several states/regions. Simmering historical tensions exist across certain key states, and, in some locations, these tensions have become exacerbated as a consequence of military intervention. Numerous new forces have emerged, and several ethnic armed groups, established many years before the military intervention, have become increasingly recommitted to the insurgency resulting in fighting occurring in areas that have been without conflict for decades., Some sources have recorded nearly 13,000 political violence and protest events throughout 2021. The degree of violence against civilians has been severe. The number of casualties has increased, while thousands of houses and the properties of other civilians have been burnt down or destroyed. This has triggered multiple large scale population displacements. As of 28 February 2022, roughly 873,000 people have been internally displaced in Myanmar. About 502,600 people have been displaced by insecurity and the increased vulnerability of host and resident communities in affected areas since 1 February 2021. The northwest part of Myanmar (Sagaing, Magway and Chin) has recorded the highest level of new internal displacements, with 246,600 internally displaced persons (IDPs) (49 per cent), followed by the southeast part of Myanmar (Kayin, Kayah, and Shan) with 233,600 IDPs contributing 46.5 per cent. Displaced populations face significant challenges in access to basic needs and services, specifically, food, healthcare, shelter materials, clean water, and sanitation facilities., Myanmar is also experiencing a socio-economic crisis exacerbated by the protracted COVID-19 epidemic. The local currency, the Kyat, has fluctuated with a significant drop in value by 60 per cent7 in the month of September 2021, while costs for food items, fuel, and other essential goods have soared. In September 2021, inflation increased to 7.3 per cent. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that in 2021, some 1.6 million jobs were lost, leaving only 18.9 million women and men employed. The farming, construction, garment, tourism, and hospitality industries are among the hardest hit. The economic and political volatility is projected to have driven almost half of the population into poverty in 2022., The 2022 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) for Myanmar , which was published on 31 December 2021, predicts that approximately a quarter of the population (14.4 million people – 4.9 million women and five million children) will be classified as requiring humanitarian support during 2022, up from about one million people in need before February 2021. This increase is driven by the social, economic and health impacts of COVID-19, worsening food insecurity, and the mass movement of the population since the events of 1 February 2021 and subsequent need for protection. These factors have generated an array of new needs and exacerbated the vulnerability of specific groups., The HNO analysis estimated that 14 out of 15 states and regions in Myanmar are now within the critical threshold for acute malnutrition. Prices for key commodities in some states and regions have increased significantly, resulting in some food items no longer being affordable to many families. At the beginning of 2022, fuel prices increased by 14-18 per cent from the previous month. Compared to the pre-crisis period through to March 2022, fuel prices skyrocketed by 82-150 per cent , impacting transportation costs and contributing to unpredictable commodity prices., Humanitarian access to reach conflict-affected populations remains a major challenge for the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) and other humanitarian organizations. Travel restrictions are currently in place due to the security context, military checkpoints, stringent administrative authorization requirements, and COVID-19 regulations., This has impacted the distribution of humanitarian resources, direct support from personnel and disrupted monitoring and evaluation activities, including data collection and verification. Several private companies have withdrawn and/or halted services in Myanmar, which has impacted transportation, the supply chain, and costs, eventually delaying humanitarian assistance from reaching those most in need., With continuous dialogue and advocacy efforts with all stakeholders and state administrators, the MRCS gradually secured safe access to wider vulnerable populations. This engagement is based on autonomous Red Cross Red Crescent-led needs assessments and a decision-making process that supports independent humanitarian action. The MRCS collaborates with both International Red Cross Red Crescent Movement (the Movement) and non-Movement partners, such as UN agencies, to deliver assistance to broader geographic areas. The National Society remains flexible and adaptive to the dynamic operational context to reach the most vulnerable and affected populations whilst ensuring compliance with security protocols for mobilizing personnel.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-asia-pacific-complex-emergency-emergency-appeal-ndeg-mdrmm016-revised-operational-strategy

Food and Nutrition",5 Jul 2022,"Highlights, The cost of the basic food basket (rice, oil, chickpeas, salt) remained stable in most areas, except in Mon where the price of chickpeas and salt increased as the rainy season contributed to ongoing transportation challenges and costs., Edible oil prices were stable overall in May, although with some variation seen across markets due to transportation costs. It is unclear to what extent the rate setting of edible oil prices at wholesale level, implemented by the Ministry of Commerce in an effort to stem price escalation, affected retail prices in retail markets., Slight seasonal increases in rice prices (+3% overall) were observed as planting season got underway., Egg prices continue to rise (+10%) due in large part to high costs of chicken feed, linked to declining availability of livestock feed amidst Russia-Ukraine conflict. Almost all areas are now seeing prices more than 50% higher than last year., Tomato prices increased across most markets due to decline in local seasonal production., Transportation is still affected everywhere by insecurity (particularly in Chin, Sagaing and Kayin) as well as the high costs of fuel – Octane fuels rose by about 13% and diesel by about 24% month-on-month since April and are more than double that of one year ago.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/wfp-myanmar-market-price-update-may-2022

Localisation Approach of Humanitarian Protection Responses in Myanmar - HARP-Facility,Evaluation and Lessons Learned,Crown Agents,Protection and Human Rights,30 Jun 2022,"This case study has been written by HARP-Facility (HARP-F), bringing together perspectives from the local protection organisations HARP-F partnered with in Kachin state, experiences of the national Technical Assistant (TA) hired by HARP-F and the HARP-F regional programmes team. This case study aims to showcase how the HARP-F localisation approach was applied in the protection sector through partnership with two local organisations. The case study discusses the localisation context at the time of partnership and HARP-F’s approach, both the broader approach HARP-F took and specific approach within protection in Kachin state. Finally, the case study discusses achievements, lessons learnt and emerging recommendations from the experience of HARP-F and the partners., Localisation Context: Protection Sector Experience, Humanitarian protection response is one of the main humanitarian-thematic responses in Myanmar as identified in the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). Housing, land, property, general protection, women’s protection, and child protection are notably the key protection clusters that have been implemented across Myanmar. The implementation modality most applied is through INGO partnership with local protection organisations. This is due to access restrictions and the sensitivities of engaging with ethnic armed organisations, particularly in Kachin state. Some INGOs apply direct implementation, though this is more common in Rakhine state than Kachin state., Transparent, professional, and friendly relationships between INGOs, UN Agencies, intermediaries and local partners are the foundations of achieving localisation partnership objectives. However, as was observed by some protection stakeholders, many local organisations were continually reluctant to share challenges and difficulties with upstream partners. This occurred as a result of two main beliefs; first, that their own funding could be impacted as the result of sharing challenges faced in implementation, and second, that the upstream partner might be monitoring them under the guise of technical assistance and support. These perceptions resulted in less openness from local organisations with their partner organisations, despite efforts by INGOs and UN Agencies to ensure that strong partnership foundations were properly communicated and maintained., Another challenged by local protection organisations is the varied standards of training and technical guidelines, as well as on-the-job learning opportunities provided by international organisations to their local partner organisations. This was due to the structure in which protection projects were implemented through. Generally, technical staff and experts were managed by protection INGOs and intermediaries, while field implementers were managed by LNGOs. As those two workforces are distinct from each other and physically located in two different areas, several challenges emerged. Firstly, protection technical staff have only filtered knowledge, as they rely on updates from implementing organisations. These updates were often limited to project-only information and lacked the broader contextual and organisational information. This made it difficult for technical staff to provide effective protection and technical inputs, or to prioritise the protection issues for programming as they couldn’t ascertain all the difficulties that the partner team were facing. Secondly, the protection technical staff based in INGOs offices had multiple tasks and had to cover wider project areas. This limited their capacity to spend sufficient time with partners, at partner offices and in the field. Thirdly, many protection technical staff from INGOs had a dual role of technical support and grant management of the partners. This meant LNGOs were reluctant to be transparent with them due to concerns of monitoring by the INGO., Despite several years and different forms of support from international protection agencies, local protection organisations still had a high level of technical dependency for project implementation. Due to the nature of protection interventions, as a service provided to beneficiaries, rather than an item that is distributed, it is almost impossible to maintain a project without high quality staff. However, staff retention for local protection organisations was a challenge as many found it difficult to keep staff members once a certain level of skills and experience had been achieved. In addition, local partners were unable to provide long term growth and learning opportunities to skilled staff nor competitive benefit packages. Therefore, local organisations rely on the international protection organisations to fill technical capacity gaps within their humanitarian protection projects.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/localisation-approach-humanitarian-protection-responses-myanmar-harp-facility

On the night of November 26th 2021, a 15-year-old girl named Naw O---, who lives in E---village, Hteh Wah Law village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township, Dooplaya District reported being sexually assaulted by a G--- High School committee member named F---, a 54-year-old male living in A--- village, Noh Taw Plah village tract, Noh T’Kaw Township, Dooplaya District, after he asked her and two other female students from the school to help peel betel nut at his home. After the incident occurred, it was difficult for the victim to continue her education. Although the case initially seemed to have been brought to local authorities, the family eventually decided not to pursue the case further. The school had also been waiting for a decision by local authorities before taking action, but in the meantime, F---‘s contract ended and he left the school.[1], Excerpt, Part 2 - Information Quality, 1. Explain in detail how you collected this information., The KHRG field researcher first found out about the incident from Naw[3] R---, a teacher at H--- school [another local school] who lives in H---village, Noh Taw Plah village tract, Noh T’Kaw Township, Dooplaya District. The researcher also talked with two teachers from G--- High School (the victim’s school) in A--- village, Noh Taw Plah village tract, the mother of the victim, and the victim herself., 2. Explain how the source verified this information., The information was provided by the victim herself, the victim’s mother, two teachers (Naw Y--- and Naw P---) from the victim’s school in A--- village. The victim talked about the incident with the people who are close to her., Part 3 – Complete Description of the Incident, Describe the Incident(s) in complete detail. For each incident, be sure to include 1) when the incident happened, 2) where it happened, 3) what happened, 4) how it happened, 5) who was involved, and 6) why it happened. Also describe any villager response(s) to the incident, the aftermath and the current living situation of the victims. Please use the space prepared below, and create an attachment if needed., Fifteen-year-old Naw O---, who lives in [is from] E--- village, Hteh Wah Law village tract, Kaw T’Ree (Kawkareik) Township, Dooplaya District [but is studying in A--- village, Noh Taw Plah village tract, Noh T’Kaw (Kyainseikgyi) Township, Dooplaya District] reported to KHRG that she was sexually assaulted by a G--- High School committee member named F---, a 54-year-old male living in A--- village, Noh Taw Plah village tract, Noh T’Kaw Township, Dooplaya District on the night of November 26th 2021., According to Naw O---, she accompanied two of her female school friends to the house of the G--- High School committee member, F---, on the evening of November 26th, after they had been asked to go to his house to help him peel betel nut. They had been told they would receive some pocket money in exchange for their work. The three female students live at the G--- High School dormitory (the dormitory is situated in the G--- High School compound)., On the evening of November 26th 2021, the school committee member, F---, picked up the three female students at the G--- High School dormitory and brought them to work at his house. According to Naw O---, the three female students helped peel betel nuts for a few hours., Due to the late hour that they finished, the girls stayed the night. The three girls (along with a 15-year-old female villager from A--- village) stayed the night and slept together in the same room. Naw O--- was sleeping in between the other girls. Naw O--- stated that during the middle of the night, she felt cold and realised that the blanket that she had covered herself with when she went to sleep had been pulled away. She could feel something touching her thigh. At first she thought it was a cat, but then realised that it was a hand. When she grabbed her torchlight, the hand pulled away. She then turned on her torchlight and saw the school committee member sitting nearby on the steps, with his back to her. From what she could see, he was not wearing his shirt, just short pants. She then turned the light off and tried to go back to sleep. She was not able to sleep the rest of the night, and was afraid. She added: “I felt really sad.”, The next morning, she and the other students continued working, but she felt too discouraged to work. When she could not control her tears thinking about what had happened to her, she told her friends that she wanted them all to return to their dormitory. They were each given 1,000 kyats [USD 0.56][4] for the work they had done before they returned to the school. They returned to G--- High School at 1:30 pm. She first talked about the incident with one of her friends who lives in the same village with her while they were returning home., She called her mother that evening, and the next day, on November 28th 2021, her mother went to meet her at her school. Her mother met with two teachers. The teachers told her that they would handle the case, but [at the time of the interview with KHRG on January 3rd 2022] Naw O---’s mother said that she had not yet heard any reply from them. She then returned home, but told her daughter to stay at the school, believing it would be better for her to finish out the academic year: “My daughter wanted to come back with me. I am afraid the news about this will spread that is why I let her stay there. I will let her finish school there this year. Next year, I will remove her from the school. She will surely be embarrassed among her friends. She is convincing herself and her friends also [try to] convince her to finish her studies [the academic year]. I don’t want this kind of situation to happen in the future so my daughter will be able to study without any disturbance.”, According to one of the teachers with whom Naw O---’s mother had spoken, after the incident happened, the parents from the same village as the victim, and who keep their children - especially their daughters - at the dormitory did not want to keep their children at the dormitory anymore. [Information about the incident circulated among the other students, who then told their parents.] She added that the school’s head secretary encouraged the parents to let their children live at the dormitory until the end of the school year as there were only two or three more months to be finished. If the students dropped out from the school, they would lose the whole year. That is why the parents waited until the end of the academic year to move their children to another school. [A total of 11 children (four male, seven female) from E--- village were studying at G--- High School. When the school year resumed, all seven female students went to study at N--- refugee camp in Thailand.], Naw O--- is afraid she will be harmed by the perpetrator. According to her teacher, at one point she asked to stay with her because she was afraid to stay in the dormitory, but the teacher thought that it would lead to rumours. Naw O--- stated: “I want this case to be solved. I worry I will be threatened. It didn’t happen in my village so I am afraid. I am away from my parents. I do not know anything about whether this case will be solved by the local authorities from A--- village. I would like this case to be solved. I am thinking of dropping out from the school. I am afraid of him [the school committee member] and would like to stay away from him. Actually, I want to study, but I am afraid to continue to study and stay here. I feel embarrassed staying among my friends. I don’t want this kind of situation happening to my friends.”, After the incident, Naw O--- was not as active as she used to be. However, after a few weeks, she began to play and work on her studies as normal. Naw O--- told another teacher: “This incident became my nightmare and [the source of my] worries.” Naw O--- also said that she does not dare return to G--- High School for the next academic year., The G--- High School teachers would also like to see a resolution to the case, but noted that the decision about dismissing the school committee member is up the local authorities in the area. Thus, the school’s decision on whether F--- will be dismissed from the school or not is still on hold., One of the G--- High School teachers added, “It is a violation of her rights both physically and mentally by looking at [if we consider] child rights, women’s rights and youth and student rights.” Another teacher stated, “It would not be alright for this case to disappear. […] How can this child depend on us (authorities) [if we do not resolve the case]?”, Update from June 3rd 2022: Despite the initial interest by the teachers and the victim in seeking justice regarding this incident, no further action has been taken. The school committee member continued to work at the school following the incident. He has since left the school, but not because of a decision by the school or local authorities. Rather, he left because his three-year term had ended. There are currently no judicial bodies undertaking this case either because the victim’s family did not want to report this case to the authorities. The victim’s parents said they do not want to report this case to the court as they would not know what to say in court. The parents also worry that the perpetrator is good at talking and will reject the accusation of sexually assaulting their daughter, Naw O---., Part 4 - Permission for Using the Details, Did the victim(s) provide permission to use this information?

Protection and Human Rights",1 Jul 2022,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, This report covers the period January to December 2021 and outlines TBC’s progress based on the organisation’s Strategic Directions for Thailand and Myanmar 2020–2022., The Myanmar Armed Forces staged a coup on 1st of February, citing false claims of electoral fraud. following the coup nationwide protests were held in opposition to the unconstitutional seizure of power by the SAC. Over 1,300 people were killed by the military in its crackdown against protests and conflict between both EAOs and PDFs against the military increased. The National Unity Government was formed in opposition to SAC and has played a major role in opposition to SAC in the international arena. In southeastern Myanmar indiscriminate artillery attacks against civilians in northern Karen and Kayah States were the primary cause of displacement for 200,000 people by the year’s end. The humanitarian situation inside Myanmar became increasingly dire, with few avenues for positive developments. TBC provided an emergency response where over 200,000 civilians benefitted from access to multi-sectoral humanitarian aid to alleviate basic needs. The coup, and subsequent breakdown in central government exacerbated the threats of COVID-19 and facilitated a failing vaccine drive and inadequate healthcare support to those with COVID-19. By the end of the year 16,000 people had died from COVID-19. The coup also devastated Myanmar’s economy and banking system and vastly increased the number of people living in poverty., In Thailand, outbreaks of COVID-19 occurred in eight refugee camps. Coronavirus Infection Prevention & Control (IPC) protocols continued to be implemented throughout the year and has led to largely remote communications with camps. Despite these challenges food security remained strong and stable in all camps. Indeed, the humanitarian needs of encamped refugees of food, cooking fuel and shelter were met, while TBC also facilitated key activities in nutrition, shelter and camp governance. Due to COVID-19 and the military coup, the UNHCR-facilitated voluntarily repatriation, postponed in 2020, as well as TBC’s assistance for return preparedness, remained on hold. TBC also provided emergency humanitarian support to those displaced from fighting in Myanmar and who sought refuge in Thailand. Since February 2021, approximately 16,000 refugees crossed into Thailand to flee fighting and seek protection. They were disallowed entry to the established refugee camps and the majority of these new refugees returned to Myanmar, mostly under duress, with 3,200 still in Thailand in Temporary Safety Areas at the year’s end. At the end of December 4,800 officially remained in Temporary Safety areas. Meanwhile, 80,982 people remained in the nine camps in Thailand of whom, during the year, 410 were resettled to third countries and 1,313 children were born in the camps.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/border-consortium-2021-annual-report-enmy
Myanmar Military Atrocities Laid Bare in Gruesome Footage,News and Press Release,HRW,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",4 Jul 2022,"UN Member States Should Press for Arms Embargo, ICC Referral, Manny Maung, Myanmar Researcher, Asia Division, Shocking footage has recently emerged on social media of brutal killings allegedly in Myanmar’s Sagaing Region where a United Nations investigator has documented apparent war crimes by the Myanmar military., The footage, recovered from a cell phone belonging to a Myanmar soldier and verified by media outlet Radio Free Asia (RFA), but not independently verified by Human Rights Watch, shows about 30 men captured after a Myanmar military raid in Mon Taing Pin village, Ayadaw township, on May 10, 2022. At least five of them later appear dead, their hands bound, shot from behind. RFA reported that a villager had found the phone after it had been dropped. In the footage, three soldiers discuss in Burmese the number of people they have killed. A sergeant, identified by the insignia on his uniform, brags about shooting and killing 26 people. Another soldier says he killed five people by slitting their throats., The images are further damning evidence of the brutal military operation underway in Sagaing Region. They reinforce a pattern of killings that Human Rights Watch and other human rights groups have documented that bear the hallmarks of the military’s atrocities., As international attention to Myanmar wanes, its soldiers appear to be more willing to record even the most horrific acts of violence against the civilian population. Military-linked Telegram accounts post images of brutality. There is no evidence whatsoever that military commanders are acting to stop such atrocities; they may be directly responsible for them. Since the February 2021 coup, Human Rights Watch and others have documented that the military and pro-military militias have summarily executed and forcibly disappeared civilians and razed villages during military operations., International efforts to hold the military junta accountable are falling short. Concerned governments should persistently press the UN Security Council to impose an arms embargo and refer the country situation to the International Criminal Court. If Russia and China choose to veto it, they will have to explain to UN member states why they have chosen to side with a military implicated in numerous atrocity crimes. In the meantime, governments should use national and regional mechanisms to expand efforts to financially isolate the junta., Unified international efforts are needed or the post-coup reality for Myanmar’s people will remain one horror after another.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-military-atrocities-laid-bare-gruesome-footage

This BGF unit is led by Lieutenant Colonel Saw Kyaw Win., The incident began when Ko O---’s car was stopped at the BGF checkpoint on his journey to Kamamaung Town to buy food ordered by other villagers living in E--- village.

In Myanmar, while wasting/ acute malnutrition has decreased from 13%3 in 1991 to 7%4 in 2018, the prevalence of wasting/ acute malnutrition remains above the global target and progress has likely deteriorated due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the coup d’etat in February 2021., Wasting/ acute malnutrition treatment in Myanmar is integrated into the existing health service delivery system where healthcare workers who provide wasting/ acute malnutrition services also treat children with pneumonia, malaria and other diseases.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Jul 2022,"Highlights, • Halfway throughout the year, UNICEF has only received 19 per cent of the required financial resources to respond to increasing humanitarian needs. This is severely affecting the capacity to respond. Without additional resources, targeted children in need will not access humanitarian assistance and services., • The national total of internally displaced people (IDP) has reached an unprecedented 1.1 million, including 758,500 IDPs since 1 February 2021, consequently increasing the multisectoral needs of the displaced communities., • Direct distribution was provided by UNICEF to IDPs in Loikaw and Demoso townships in Kayah from 7 to 14 June. A total of 16,023 individuals from 3,566 households received much-needed WASH, child protection, education, health and nutrition supplies., • 1,862 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition have received treatment since the beginning of the year, representing 5 per cent of the target. The nutrition programme has a funding gap of 86 per cent. With additional funding, the targeted 37,503 severely malnourished children could be provided with therapeutic treatment., Funding Overview and Partnerships, UNICEF Myanmar Country Office is appealing for US$151.4 million to deliver humanitarian assistance to the displaced and host populations across the country. The Myanmar Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) estimates that a total of 14.4 million people, including 5 million children, are in need of assistance this year. UNICEF has received generous contributions from the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/BHA), the Government of Denmark, the European Commission/ECHO, the German Federal Foreign Office (GFFO), the Government of Japan, the Korean Committee for UNICEF, the Government of Norway, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), and the Global Humanitarian Thematic Funding. These funds will contribute to delivering much-needed assistance through UNICEF Child Protection, Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Education, Health and Nutrition programmes and responses to affected populations. Although US$29.13 million has been received so far through the UNICEF Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) appeal, the funding gap of 81 per cent is severely affecting our ability to provide aid to the targeted populations, especially children in need of humanitarian assistance and services. Continued donor support is critical to continue scaling up the response. UNICEF expresses its sincere appreciation to all private and public donors for their contributions to supporting the children of Myanmar., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, The humanitarian and security situation remains extremely serious across the country, particularly in the northwest and southeast regions, where active fighting continues to be reported, resulting in continuous population displacement. As of 20 June 2022, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported a national total of more than 1.1 million displaced civilians1 , including 758,500 internally displaced people (IDP) across the country since the military takeover of 1 February 2021, in addition to 346,600 IDP estimated to be displaced before the coup. For the past two months, a considerable surge of displacement has been reported in Sagaing, with a total of 395,600 IDPs located within the region, including an estimated 146,000 children and their families with immediate needs for essential services. Clashes and insecurity are currently hindering most partners from accessing the area, and the deteriorating situation is triggering severe concerns as needs are expected to increase, while access remains restricted. The restrictions and barriers on access to internet, in addition to the constraints related to transportation of basic supplies, pose further obstacles to the coordination and distribution of aid in the region., In the southeast, the overall number of people displaced by conflict remains stable, and new displacements during this period have been offset by reported returns. At the beginning of June, UNHCR reported2 approximately 83,000 IDPs in Kayah and more than 50,000 IDPs in southern Shan. UNICEF accessed Loikaw township in Kayah state, where a significant number of IDPs was reported to have returned. Immediate delivery of humanitarian assistance was provided by UNICEF through the direct distribution modality from 7 to 14 June. A total of 16,023 individuals from 3,566 households in Loikaw and Demoso townships received basic WASH, child protection, education, health and nutrition supplies. UNICEF provided mine risk education through pamphlets to 1,500 families, 340 pregnant and lactating mothers received multi-vitamin tablets covering a period of 3 months, 864 children aged 6 to 59 months received nutrition bowls and feeding messages, 1,400 children aged 5 to 12 years received storybooks about COVID-19 prevention and social skills to reinforce reading capabilities, 2,500 children under the age of 18 received child protection kits, and 33 communities received water purification tablets and knowledge on how to use them in order to prevent waterborne diseases. The overall distribution was achieved successfully and brought considerable relief to the returned communities. UNICEF hopes to build upon this experience to foster continuous access to areas previously out of reach. Unimpeded access remains crucial for the delivery of life-saving assistance and appropriate coverage of essential services for the most vulnerable population, including children, often located in areas with severe operational constraints.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-myanmar-humanitarian-situation-report-no-5-1-30-june-2022

In a 2020 report, High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet noted that discrimination and exclusion against ethnic and religious minority groups have been the hallmark of the laws and policies of Myanmar for over half a century., Speaking at the panel, Bachelet reminded the Council that more than one million Rohingyas have fled their homes in Rakhine State to seek refuge in neighboring Bangladesh since the military unleashed a military campaign five years ago., “At the same time, in the wake of the military coup of February 2021, we also continue to witness the re-escalation of armed conflicts and violent repression in many other parts of Myanmar, inflicting yet more displacement and suffering on ethnic and religious minorities,” Bachelet said., The High Commissioner urged the international community to stand united in pressuring the military to halt its military campaigns., “The international community must use its influence to restore rule of the country to a legitimate and independent civilian government with no military oversight of the executive, legislative and judicial powers.”, “Living in an open prison”, Nu, who travels the world to speak publicly on the plight of Rohingya women and girls, described the situation in Rakhine State as “living in an open prison.” She said the military junta has declared that it will enforce the death penalty of four democracy activists., Over 600,000 Rohingyas continue to live in apartheid-like conditions, she told the panel, including 140,000 forcibly segregated in internally displaced person camps, where they are denied access to basic needs and livelihoods., The military requires Rohingyas to obtain permission to travel within and outside of Rakhine State, arresting those who allegedly violate such a discriminatory policy, she said. Rohingyas must also present national verification cards which do not confer citizenship and identify them as “Bengali” to conduct their daily activities, including traveling for medical treatment and schools., Those who have fled the country have not met better conditions, with refugees living in squalid refugee camps and detention centers in neighboring countries and facing the threat of falling victim to sex traffickers, Nu said., Thyn Zar Oo, co-founder and programme director of the Public Legal Aid Network, blamed Myanmar’s violence on institutional racism, ultranationalist attitudes and colonial-era fears of losing cultural and religious identity. To move forward, the county needs to implement reforms that promote equality and freedom, and access to justice and information rather than propaganda., “The country needs a change of mindset,” Oo said., Laetitia van den Assum, a diplomatic expert and member of the Rakhine Advisory Commission headed by the late Kofi Annan, said ending segregation and reintroducing ethnically mixed schools would help bring an end to violence. Statelessness is not only an issue for Rakhine State and the Rohingyas, she noted., “There are thousands of others who are considered stateless, including Gurkhas, Tamils, Hindus and Chinese. If Myanmar does not bring its legislation in line with international standards, its problem will continue to grow,” Van den Assum said., For Imtiaz Ahmed, Professor of International Relations and Director of the Centre for Genocide Studies at the University of Dhaka, Myanmar’s policy towards the Rohingya is rooted in an “unspoken racial feeling” of the military and civilian elite of the country, which led to the national Constitution of Myanmar, a charter that does not recognize the Rohingyas, “It is clear that without bringing pressure, including economic and political sanctions, nothing will change the tragic fate of the Rohingyas,” Ahmed said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/activist-accuses-military-seeking-erase-myanmars-rohingyas

Humanitarian Financing",30 Jun 2022,"Humanitarian situation in 2021
In 2021, Myanmar faced an unprecedented political, socioeconomic, health, human rights and humanitarian crisis with needs escalating dramatically following the military takeover on 1 February and a severe third wave of COVID-19. The expansion of the conflict into areas that were previously peaceful and clashes between Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and People’s Defence Forces (PDF) increased displacement and drove worsening needs. Civilians endured hostilities and insecurity, with hundreds of thousands displaced and vastes swathes of the country affected by the destruction and burning of homes and property., COVID-19 pandemic
COVID-19 cases and related deaths reached their peak in July of 2021 and declined for the remainder of the year. By the end of 2021, slightly over 531,000 confirmed cases were reported, with more than 19,200 fatalities. Testing was extremely limited, suggesting that cases were likely to have been significantly undercounted. The health, social and economic impacts of this third wave were devastating with the country struggling to cope with the combined shocks of the pandemic and the military takeover within six months. Low vaccination rates at the time of the third wave were a contributing factor. Vaccinations for those on the priority list, including senior citizens aged above 65, healthcare workers and volunteers, resumed in December across many parts of the country. By the end of November 2021, slightly over 28.7 million vaccine doses had been administered. Overall, access to health facilities remained challenging with the Civil Disobedience Movement seeing medical staff and patients boycott public facilities and significant gaps in alternative services. Aid partners supported access to care for COVID-19 and other essential services while sustaining life-saving humanitarian operations., Internal displacements
The number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) within Myanmar rose substantially in 2021. According to the UN, of the 690,000 IDPs in Myanmar as of 27 December 2021, about 52 per cent were women, and 34 per cent were children. Of the total, 320,000 were displaced because of armed conflict and insecurity since 1 February 2021. Most of the new displacement occurred in Myanmar’s northwest (Chin, Magway, and Sagaing) and southeast (Kayah, Kayin, Mon, and Tanintharyi) as well as in Kachin and Shan states. The new IDPs faced terrible conditions—some in camps, some in host communities and others in the jungle, without adequate food, shelter, sanitation, and medical care. The new IDPs are in addition to the 346,000 people already displaced in Kachin, Kayin, Rakhine and Shan states before February 2021. By the end of 2021, more than 19,000 people had crossed the borders into neighbouring countries since February 2021., Security and access constraints
COVID-19 restrictions, limited availability of cash and supplies as well as road blockages due to armed conflict challenged the delivery of humanitarian aid. At the same time, increasingly slow and complex bureaucratic processes, including delays and denials of Travel Authorizations (TAs), the volatile security situation and increased scrutiny of humanitarian supplies and personnel, delayed the delivery of assistance. Humanitarian workers partnered with local civil society organizations (CSOs) and community-based organizations (COBs) to sustain life-saving responses in isolated areas that larger international actors could not reach., People in need
Across the country, three million people needed assistance and protection 2021. This included one million people identified in the original 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and another two million people subsequently identified in the Myanmar Interim Emergency Response Plan (IERP) in the wake of the February military takeover., The total requirement for the two plans amounted to US$385.6 million (HRP 2021 at $276.4 million and IERP 2021 at $109.2 million). By December, the response plans were collectively 64 per cent funded at $246 million. Donors’ contributions to the MHF represented 8.5 per cent of the funding secured against both response plans combined.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-fund-annual-report-2021

"Myanmar South East - Monthly Displacement Snapshot - Trend of people displaced in South East since Feb 2021 and remain displaced, as of 30 May 2022",Infographic,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,31 May 2022,"SE WEEKLY HIGHLIGHTS, In the South-East during the first week of May, the number of IDPs increased from 236,000 to 249,500, a level not seen since the start of the year. About 13,000 new IDPs were verified due to the rapid deterioration of the security situation in Mon State as well as continuous fighting in Kayin State. This includes 500 displaced individuals who were displaced within Myawaddy Township, Kayin State following clashes between the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) and security forces in Myawaddy town. In Kyarinseikgyi Township, Kayin State, similar clashes displaced 4,750 individuals. In Mon State, two weeks of tension and clashes between the Tatmadaw and the local armed groups in Billin Township led to a significant increase of IDPs with 8,460 individuals displaced within the township. Most are seeking safety in nearby villages and the jungle although returns of up to 1,030 IDPs were also recorded in the same township. Similarly, fighting between the Tatmadaw and People’s Defence Force (PDF) in Palaw Township, Tanintharyi Region resulted in the displacement of 1,000 individuals to nearby villages and into the jungle. Continued deterioration of the situation may cause secondary displacements to take place., In the second week, the displacement trends remained stable and the total number of IDPs was similar to the first week with 249,500 IDPs. Besides the continuous influx of IDPs in Bilin township due to the deterioration of the situation, the presence of 444 new IDPs from Hpapun Township were verified in Myaing Gyi Ngu area, Hlaingbwe Township. In addition, 603 new IDPs were verified in Palaw township. The situation in Myawaddy remained volatile however, in some areas the fighting had ceased, enabling the return of 320 IDP to their villages and 1,040 individuals had reportedly come back from the Thai side of the river., In the third week, the total of IDPs continued to increase, reaching a total of 253,100. The situation deteriorated in Bago East, especially in Shwegyin Township where clashes between MAF and KNLA were reported, resulting in the displacement of 1,929 individuals towards Nyaunglaybin Township. In Kayin, the conflict remained active in Myawaddy township where 665 new IDPs were verified in the jungle nearby Kwin Ka Lay village Tract while 55 new IDPs reportedly arrived in Hpa-pun township. In addition, UNHCHR and its partners have verified a total of 1,364 IDPs in Kalaw and Taunggyi townships in Shan State (South) who were displaced at the beginning of the year from Loikaw and Shan State (North), In Shan State (South), IDPs continued to be very mobile with arrivals of new IDPs but also IDPs returning to their villages of origin in Pekon and Loikaw Township, respectively 168 and 200 individuals. It is worth noting that about 8,400 IDPs remained in critical situation in Bilin township in Mon State with a limited access to humanitarian assistance., In the Fourth week, the total number of IDPs continued to increase, from 253,100 week before to 258,300. 5,200 individuals were verified during the week of 16 May 2022. In addition, 1,700 individuals were verified as a secondary displacement. Thus the total figure of IDPs stood at 258,300 individuals as of 23 May 2022. As most areas continued to be affected by generalized violence, there were no report of individuals returning to places of origin. While Mon State was relatively calm, Tanintharyi Region saw the largest displacement following the increased presence of the Tatmadaw with 2,400 individuals fleeing into the jungle and other places. In Bago Region (East) and Kayin State, 900 and 500 individuals respectively sought safety elsewhere due to indiscriminate shelling and sporadic attacks. In Shan State (South), armed clashes caused 1,070 individuals to flee to Pekon and Pinlaung townships, while 2,000 others were secondarily displaced to Loikaw Township in Kayah State., In the last week of May, the total number of IDPs decreased from 258,300 the week before to 256,000. Due to the sporadic armed clashes and general insecurity, verification on the number of individuals affected by new displacement had not taken place. Nonetheless, Tanintharyi saw 300 individuals experiencing secondary displacement, while 100 individuals who previously sought safety to Tanintharyi and also experienced secondary displacemen, were able to return to their places of origin. In Kayah State, over 1,700 individuals returned to Loikaw town and Demoso Township. Furthermore, more than 400 individuals have returned to their places of origin in Kayin State. A very small number of individuals were also recorded to have left Shan State (South) to their places of origin",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-south-east-monthly-displacement-snapshot-trend-people-displaced-south-east-feb-2021-and-remain-displaced-30-may-2022

Nevertheless, the security situation in Demoso Township continues to be unstable with more than 2,000 people unable to return to their places of origin and experiencing another displacement. About 600 IDPs were forced to move further north to Pekon Township in Shan State (South). In addition, more than 1,000 people were verified as having been displaced in Pekon Township following armed clashes. It is also worth noting that 200 IDPs were verified to be in Shan State (South) due to armed clashes in Kayah State’s Loikaw Township in early June.

Protection and Human Rights",29 Jun 2022,"GENEVA (29 June 2022) – Time is running out to save Myanmar’s stricken generation, the UN Child Rights Committee warned today, urging the international community to take swift action to protect the country’s children., Citing alarming findings in a report by the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, the Committee said 7.8 million children in the country remain out of school, 250,000 are internally displaced, and children have reportedly been abducted and recruited for armed conflicts. The Committee issued the following statement today:, “Children continue to bear the brunt of the Myanmar military's ongoing attacks to assert control over the territory., At least 382 children have been killed or maimed by armed groups since the February 2021 coup. In addition, over 1,400 children have reportedly been arbitrarily arrested since the coup. Children who took part or were suspected of having participated in protests, are among those detained by the military. At least 274 child political prisoners remained in the military’s custody as of 27 May this year., The military also takes children of human rights defenders hostage to pressure their parents to surrender. According to the latest report by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, at least 61 children are currently being held hostage by the junta., Rohingya children have been arrested and detained for alleged migration-related offences. Torture and ill-treatment, including sexual abuse, have allegedly been inflicted on these children., The number of children being abducted for recruitment purposes is on the rise, as well as children joining local defence groups and being particularly exposed to the danger of being killed or injured. They have been dispatched to participate in armed conflicts., The economic and humanitarian crises are having devastating impacts on children and fueling all forms of violence and exploitation. The Committee is deeply concerned that the military intentionally impedes access to food, funds, medical aid, and communication to weaken the support base for armed resistance and provoke fear. Child trafficking and child labour are reportedly on the rise in Myanmar., According to UN figures, the estimated number of internally displaced people since the coup in the country has passed 700,000, including more than 250,000 children, as of 1 June 2022., More than half of the country’s child population, about 7.8 million, remain out of school. The UN has documented 260 attacks on schools and education personnel since the coup, and 320 cases of the use of schools by armed groups between February 2021 and March 2022., It is estimated that 33,000 children will die from preventable causes in 2022 merely due to the lack of routine immunizations. In addition, 1.3 million children and more than 700,000 pregnant or breastfeeding women require nutritional support. As a result, experts warn of a looming food crisis and a dramatic increase in rates of childhood malnutrition., The rights of children in Myanmar must be respected and protected under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, both ratified by Myanmar, as well as under the international humanitarian law., The Committee urges Myanmar’s military to cease involving children in the hostilities, stop taking children hostage, end unlawful detention and torture and ill-treatment of children in captivity, and release all detained children immediately and unconditionally., Perpetrators of atrocity crimes against children must be held accountable before impartial and independent courts. The Committee also reiterates its call for the UN and civil society organizations to have safe and unrestricted access to deliver assistance and services to Myanmar’s most vulnerable children., The Committee calls on the international community to urgently reassess and redesign the global response to the crises in Myanmar, prioritize children’s rights over other considerations, and take concrete measures to alleviate their suffering.”, ENDS, For more information and media requests in Geneva, please contact:

Food and Nutrition",27 Jun 2022,"Key points, Humanitarian needs in Myanmar continue to rise sharply since February 2021 as a result of political and economic upheaval and increased conflict., Myanmar is facing a rapidly growing food security crisis, and nearly one in four people are already food insecure. Ongoing violence, economic crisis, recurrent climate-induced shocks, population displacement and COVID-19, among other factors, are disrupting the entire national food system., Since January 2022, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has assisted 14 115 households (70 575 people) through the provision of staple crop seeds and fertilizers along with the implementation of cash-based interventions, enabling them to produce their own food and meet their basic needs., Challenges facing food security and agriculture, Agriculture is a source of livelihoods for nearly 70 percent of the population of Myanmar. The ongoing crisis is reversing hard-won agricultural development gains and posing an enormous threat to the livelihoods and food security of agriculture-dependent communities. Intense violence is triggering new waves of population displacement and disrupting livelihoods across the food supply chain. In 2021, 24 percent of farmers reduced the size of their planted areas and 18 percent reported a reduction in expected harvest. Moreover, while the incomes of smallholder farmers continue to decline, the cost of production inputs continue to rise. For example, the cost of fertilizers is currently 3.6 times higher than in 2019 and high-quality seeds are increasingly becoming unavailable or unaffordable. As a result, food production is declining and food prices are soaring, leading to unprecedented and critical levels of food insecurity with 89 percent of households adopting at least one negative coping mechanism. Against this backdrop, protecting the livelihoods of smallholder farmers to enable them to feed themselves and their communities is a frontline humanitarian response. Without urgent and scaled up interventions to protect agricultural livelihoods, the food security crisis will inevitably deteriorate further and the numbers of people who resort to negative coping mechanisms and/or rely on food aid for their survival will continue to grow., In collaboration with its local and international partners, FAO is responding to the crisis through providing smallholder farmers across Myanmar with access to fertilizers and high-quality seeds along with the implementation of cash-based interventions. Furthermore, FAO will provide livestock keeping households with animal feed to enable them to keep their livestock assets alive, healthy and productive. FAO is also focusing on enhancing the technical knowledge and skills of community-based service providers, and on promoting healthy diets among highly vulnerable groups.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-response-overview-june-2022

In Rakhine State, women, children and men of all ages are exposed to these challenges, especially the hazard of landmines, that continue to disrupt their lives and livelihoods., The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) works with the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) to promote awareness of the risks that landmines pose for all communities. By sharing life-saving information in our training sessions, which the participants then pass on to their communities, we can help thousands of people every year., ""Dangerous explosive hazards can be found in the forests and gardens close to where communities live. Since surveys and demining of land contaminated by such hazards remains uncertain, it is vital to continue our risk awareness sessions,"" said Ko Than Htun, who runs these training sessions for the ICRC., Besides these trainings, we also provide medical and financial assistance to survivors and families of landmine incidents.

The next humanitarian update will be issued in July 2022., HIGHLIGHTS & KEY MESSAGES, • The number of displaced men, women and children in Myanmar remains above one million. This includes nearly 760,000 people displaced by the conflict and insecurity since the military takeover in February last year., • The monsoon season continues to cause heavy rain and flooding. In June in Kachin State, 600 people were relocated to higher grounds due to flooding. Responses by the de facto authorities and humanitarian partners are underway in high-risk areas., • Humanitarians continue providing critical life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable people despite access challenges and limited funding. Concerted advocacy efforts have led to new, but modest access in the country’s southeast. Expanded access in hard-to reach areas across the southeast and the northwest (Chin, Sagaing and Magway) is still much needed., • Inflation in commodity prices, including food, fuel, shelter materials and NFIs, remains a major concern to partners in addressing the needs of the most vulnerable people. Myanmar is particularly vulnerable to price hikes given its heavy dependence on importation of products., • More than four million children—half of the school-aged children in Myanmar—have not accessed education for two full academic years., • The limited availability of staff, health facilities and supplies are contributing to the worsening of maternal and child health outcomes and poor emergency health care. The monsoon season will increase the spread of communicable diseases, which requires urgent action and expansion of basic primary health care and preventive measures., • Approximately 71,600 internally displaced people (IDPs) in MAF-AA displacement sites in Rakhine State lack treatment programs for malnourished children and pregnant and lactating women. This is a critical gap given levels of malnutrition in IDP communities in Rakhine State., • The funding situation for 2022 remains dire with the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) only 11 per cent funded six months into the year. This leaves a gap of US$740m (FTS), negatively affecting the breadth and quality of assistance delivered by humanitarians., KEY FIGURES *, 1M People internally displaced across Myanmar, 758K People currently displaced by clashes and insecurity since February 2021, 346K People internally displaced mainly in Rakhine, Kachin, Chin, and Shan due to conflict prior to February 2021, 18K Civilian properties estimated burnt or destroyed since February 2021., *Displacement figures fluctuate during any given month. These figures represent the number of people currently displaced. Cumulative numbers for returns and displacement are not always available., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Fighting has escalated across multiple states and regions in Myanmar, particularly in the southeast and northwest during the reporting period, with no signs of abating. Nearly, 2,000 civilians were killed during hostilities and other fatal incidents, including landmines and explosive remnant of war (ERWs) since the military takeover. The number of IDPs has also continued to increase despite some reported returns. According to UN figures, the estimated number of IDPs since the military takeover has passed 758,000, including more than 250,000 children bringing the total number of IDP across the country to over 1,100,000. Over 40,000 people remain in neighbouring countries since the takeover. More than 18,058 civilian properties, including houses, churches, monasteries, and schools are estimated to have been destroyed during hostilities, although figures are difficult to verify. The level of destruction of civilian properties, particularly homes, combined with the seemingly never-ending fighting will very likely prolong the displacement of the IDPs and would further deteriorate their already fragile living conditions., The current volatile security situation and its associated restrictions, such as bureaucratic processes, systematic blocks on access approvals, continue to hamper humanitarian access and delay the delivery of assistance. People’s suffering across the country will be prolonged. Despite these obstacles, humanitarian partners, including local partners, continue to stay and deliver critical and life-saving assistance to address both pre-existing and new emerging needs of the most affected people, including IDPs and host community, wherever possible. These include responses to temporary evacuated people who are affected by this year’s monsoon season. In parallel, recent concerted advocacy efforts to gain principled access have borne fruits in the past two months and partners managed to reach areas previously not fully accessible in Kayah, reaching tens of thousands of people with shelter, NFI, hygiene and food assistance. A multisector needs identification mission of the displaced population from Kayah to southern Shan was also possible. This will be followed by a multi-sectoral distribution at the end of June/early July. It is hoped that these openings could be a step towards broader access in hard-to-reach areas across the southeast. Despite these modest improvements, overall access to conflict areas remains a challenge especially in areas outside the control of the State Administration Council (SAC). Humanitarian access to the northwest also remains heavily restricted although some support is reaching people at a modest scale., On top of access constraints, funding remains critical to provide the breadth and quality of humanitarian assistance. Six months into 2022, the Humanitarian Response Plan is only 11 per cent funded, leaving a gap of US$740m (FTS). The ability of humanitarian partners to save more lives and reduce suffering throughout the remainder of the year will be dependent on increased funding, improved access approvals, application of creative, flexible funding and response modalities, as well as the removal or easing of the bottlenecks such as visa delays and banking restrictions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-update-no-19-28-june-2022

Southeast Asian MPs urge ASEAN economic ministers to immediately tackle food crisis,News and Press Release,APHR,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",27 Jun 2022,"JAKARTA – As food and fuel prices are rising at alarming rates throughout the world, Parliamentarians from Southeast Asia are urging the economic ministers of their countries to gather in an emergency summit and agree on measures to tackle impending food shortages and widespread hunger currently threatening millions of their fellow citizens., The global economy, already weakened by the pandemic, is taking another blow with the war in Ukraine, one of the main producers of grain in the world. Shortages of food, increases in oil prices, and fears of a global recession are already increasing prices of essential commodities. The average inflation rate in ASEAN went from 3.1 percent in December 2021 to 4.7 percent in April 2022, compared to 0.9 percent in January 2021. And, as always, this affects the poor most dramatically., “ASEAN needs to act collectively, and needs to do it now. Climate change, the ravages of Covid-19, inequality in access to resources, and now Russia’s war on Ukraine, are having devastating impacts that no country can solve alone. It is necessary to urgently put in place a coordinated effort to protect the most vulnerable from a potentially devastating economic downturn,” said Mercy Barends, Member of Parliament in Indonesia and Board member of ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR)., Inflation in food prices could even further increase the number of undernourished people in ASEAN. According to data from the World Bank, the share of undernourished people ranged in 2019 from 5.3 percent in Laos to 6.5 percent in Indonesia, 6.7 percent in Vietnam, 7.6 percent in Myanmar, 8.2 percent in Thailand or 9.4 percent in the Philippines., People displaced from their homes are particularly vulnerable to increased food prices, which take an even higher toll on women and children. In Myanmar, there are over a million internally displaced persons (IDPs), most of whom were pushed to flee their homes as a consequence of the conflict triggered by the illegal coup d’état on 1 February 2021., ASEAN member states adopted in 2020 the Integrated Food Security Framework, outlining food security measures that included food emergency and shortage relief measures, but it needs to be updated and enhanced in order to address a problem which is worsening. ASEAN must prepare for the future and act decisively to facilitate easy access to food for all, support its producers, and scale-up targeted, and nutrition-sensitive, social protection programs., “Our economic ministers must come up with a clear roadmap on how to tackle the severe consequences of the current rise in food prices on those who are already experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity and hunger. We need trust and cooperation, and only through a collective effort will we be able to overcome the many challenges that have combined to create this crisis,” said Barends.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/southeast-asian-mps-urge-asean-economic-ministers-immediately-tackle-food-crisis

Fighting and indiscriminate shelling have caused the death and injury of villagers and their livestock, property damage and prolonged displacement. IDPs are facing more challenges in their temporary shelters due to strong winds and heavy rain. The constant fighting and increased military activity have led to more livelihood challenges for the local villagers. A teenage boy stepped on an SAC landmine and lost one of his legs. A villager was tortured by State Administration Council (SAC) soldiers following fighting between the SAC and Karen National Liberation Army., Noh T’Kaw (Kyainseikgyi) Township, Fighting and indiscriminate shelling, At around 8:00 am on December 31st 2021, fighting broke out between State Administration Council (SAC) Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) #432 and an unknown group in Than P’Yan village, Dali village tract, Noh T’Kaw Township, Dooplaya District, and the fighting lasted for a few minutes. During the fighting, the SAC fired mortars into the village killing a female villager named Ma Thun Hla., The SAC increased their activity in Noh T’Kaw Township since the first day of January 2022. Since January 1st 2022, SAC soldiers from LIB #432 have been shooting on a nightly basis. Although there have not been any injuries, it has created fear among the villagers. The villagers did not dare to go out at night because if they went out at night, they would have had to use a torchlight and they did not dare to use it [if villagers use a torchlight, they are at risk of being seen by SAC soldiers, who may shoot at them or arrest them]. They [the villagers] were also afraid to go and tap their rubber trees, which has created livelihood challenges for the villagers., On January 4th 2022, the person who was in charge [commander] of SAC LIB #432 met with the Kyain village head and asked him to tell the People’s Defence Force (PDF) not to attack them [SAC soldiers] when they enter the village., On January 20th 2022, fighting occurred between the SAC and Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) Battalion #18 in Aaw Hpa Lay village, Aaw Hpa Hpadoh village tract, Noh T’Kaw Township, Dooplaya District. Approximately 354 villagers fled to B--- village, and other nearby places. On January 21st 2022, the SAC indiscriminately fired mortars into the local area.

"End of Mission Statement: Thomas Andrews, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar (23 June 2022)",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,23 Jun 2022,"Myanmar: UN expert encouraged by Malaysia’s leadership on Myanmar crisis; urges regional states to adopt similar stance, KUALA LUMPUR (23 June 2022) – The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, today expressed his appreciation for Malaysia’s increasing leadership on the crisis in Myanmar, and urged States in the region to adopt a similar approach to the human rights catastrophe unfolding under military rule., “Too much is at stake for Myanmar and its people to accept complacency and inaction by the international community,” Andrews said in a statement at the end of an eight-day visit to Malaysia., “Junta forces have killed more than 2,000 civilians, arrested more than 14,000, displaced more than 700,000, driving the number of internally displaced persons well over one million, and plunged the country into an economic and humanitarian crisis that threatens the lives and wellbeing of millions., “The military’s attacks on the people of Myanmar constitute crimes against humanity and war crimes. No one has been spared the impact of the military’s violence.”, Andrews said that even before the coup, the Myanmar military had committed atrocities against the people of Myanmar. “The Rohingya faced genocidal attacks by Myanmar security forces. I have learned that there are over 104,000 registered Rohingya in Malaysia who have fled from Myanmar seeking safe haven with untold numbers who are unregistered., “My mission here provided me with a unique opportunity to sit face to face with dozens of courageous men and women and children .who fled the horrors that have engulfed many areas of Myanmar, including those who have recently arrived in Malaysia. They provided me with firsthand accounts of what they witnessed or directly experienced. These stories, without exception, emphasized the terror that is raging across the country, “A young woman told me: ‘You are walking on a path that you don’t know, towards a place you don’t know, and you could die on the way but you still go forward, because the persecution is worse behind you’., Those who fled Myanmar also told Andrews about the challenges they faced in Malaysia, citing fears of being sent to migration detention, insufficient education opportunities for their children, and instances of extortion by police officers., “Let me be clear, refugees from Myanmar are here because they were forced to come here. Their inability to return to their homes in Myanmar is directly linked to the military junta’s human rights violations and war against the people of Myanmar. It is impossible to address issues related to those seeking refuge in Malaysia and other nations in the region without directly and effectively addressing the crisis inside of Myanmar.,” Andrews said., Malaysia not only recognizes this fact, it has been willing, through the words and actions of Foreign Minister Saifuddin, to challenge ASEAN to reexamine their current policy on Myanmar, the UN expert said, adding that Foreign Minister Saifuddin had called on ASEAN to move from a policy of “noninterference” to, in his words, one of “non-indifference”., “Malaysia has given voice to the obvious fact that after more than one year, nothing has moved and since nothing has moved, more people are being killed and more people are being forced to flee the country,” Andrews said., He has not only called for ASEAN to engage with the Myanmar National Unity Government, he has begun engaging with the National Unity Government’s Foreign Minister Zin Mar Aung, Andrews said., “I look forward to working to support Malaysia’s foreign policy leadership on Myanmar, to affirm the human rights of a people under siege and to reduce the incredible scale of human suffering in Myanmar.”, ENDS, Mr. Thomas Andrews, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar;, The Special Rapporteurs, Independent Experts and Working Groups are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",23 Jun 2022,"LIFT/UNOPS response addresses immediate needs while also supporting longer-term development., Thousands of Myanmar families share a typical plight of being stuck in a cycle of conflict, rising levels of food insecurity and protracted healthcare crisis, and many have experienced multiple displacements, leaving behind their homes, crops, and livestock. For the first time, the number of displaced men, women and children in Myanmar has exceeded one million, including 700,000 people displaced by the conflict and insecurity since the military takeover in February last year. Host communities who were already struggling to sustain their livelihoods are also supporting those that have been displaced., The Livelihoods and Food Security Fund (LIFT), a multi-donor fund managed by the United Nations Office for Projects Services (UNOPS) delivers relief, livelihood and resilience programming to vulnerable communities across Myanmar aiming to sustainably improve household food security and community resilience to economic and climatic shocks and stresses. Below are several examples of how LIFT/UNOPS and its partners help support vulnerable communities and households through income generation and employment creation, strengthening of food systems and nutrition support, natural resource management, and community asset creation in a challenging environment., Support for community-based health services, LIFT and partners work with local health practitioners, volunteers and ethnic health service providers to strengthen the community-based health services by providing a wide range of integrated health, WASH and essential nutrition services to more than 300,000 people including internally displaced people, the elderly, people with disabilities, migrants, pregnant and breastfeeding women and their children, and adolescent girls., Cash-for-livelihoods support, 38-year old Ma Toe Lwin (name changed) from Mawlamyinegyun has what’s called a ‘strong business intuition’. Knowing that a high fishing season is approaching, she launched a fishing net weaving and repairing business, with cash-for-livelihoods support from LIFT’s partners. Having been in the fishing business since her early 20s, Ma Toe Lwin is able to distinguish the quality of fishing nets but it was the lack of capital that didn’t allow her to stock nets for trading before the fishing season., With cash support from LIFT, Ma Toe Lwin mobilised a group of women to produce about 100 fishing nets, in time for the upcoming fishing season so they can be sold to the fishermen. During high seasons, Ma Toe Lwin’s enterprise can employ up to 75 women allowing for a faster production chain. Proceeds from their sales are shared between the group members while a portion of earnings is saved for future investments., Agriculture development support, “We keep using traditional growing methods and our planting has faced a lot of problems like pest infection and plant diseases. We did not know very well about the proper usage of fertilizers and pesticides, which caused us low yields”, said U Saw. Having struggled for years, U Saw sought knowledge of advanced agricultural techniques that would help him to improve his farm production and support better access to healthy food for his family., When the LIFT-supported project reached the village, U Saw eagerly joined the training on agriculture to learn small-scale agri-business, good agricultural practices, and plant protection techniques. The practical sessions led him to explore natural composting methods, soil preparation methods and soil pH measurements. “In the past, I used to apply ready-made pesticides on my farm. So, it was costly and I also didn’t wear any protection while I was using chemical fertilizers and I often suffered from nausea and vomiting”., Saw was convinced of the health benefits of organically grown crops, and he upgraded his farm to an organic farm. “The project supported me with a capital fund and black bamboos which are necessary in cultivating tomatoes. Tomato is the main crop I grow and I had an acre for purely organic cultivation this year. I applied all the agricultural techniques I learned from the training and the capital support of the project also helped me step up my farm. The yield this year has really increased as I expected. I am really happy that my earnings are pretty well and I can even repay all my debts,” said U Saw with a big smile on his face., The traditional farmer who used the chemical fertilizers in the past is now stepping up as a leading farmer in the area who shares with his peers on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) that he received from the training. “We need to protect our land and environment by reducing the usage of chemicals so we are introducing organic farming step by step”, a proud and dedicated farmer U Saw said., Support and assistance for internally displaced persons, But as the COVID-19 crisis deepened, Khine Mar lost all sources of income. “It has not been easy for us since the pandemic hit. Some organizations provided us with assistance such as food and essentials, but travel and access restrictions made such support irregular”, he said., So he sought domestic work around his neighbourhood but there was little demand. He thought he had left such uncertainty behind when he fled his home village. Khine Mar was among other residents of the camp to receive a cash transfer of 65,000 MMK, provided by LIFT through its partners as a means to help IDPs cover their most basic food needs or purchase other basic items and services to protect themselves from COVID-19 and its socio-economic impacts., “It’s the first time I receive such significant support and it was timely and helpful”, said Khine Mar of the cash transfer., He used part of the payment to buy food for his children and is cooking more nutritious meals for his children. By scaling up multi-purpose cash transfer assistance, food assistance in kind and vouchers, cash/food for work schemes, psychosocial support and counselling services for trauma and gender-based violence, LIFT and partners have reached over 131,000 vulnerable people with social protection programmes in 2021 alone., Supporting small-scale community enterprises, “We all joined a dry fish (snakehead fish) production training and learned how to cut fish by removing skin and bones and preserve it without using chemicals. We sell our product locally and online, and then share the profit while keeping 5 per cent of earnings in our group’s saving fund,” said Daw Myint., It takes the group seven to ten days for a full production cycle - from purchasing raw fish to selling the ready product. Each member’s profit is sufficient to cover their household expenses such as food, education and healthcare while savings are planned for investing into other businesses. “Dried fish production is a seasonal business, and we are thinking of launching some farming enterprises too”, concluded Daw Myint., Relief & Resilience response across Myanmar, including people living with disabilities, In 2021, 30 of LIFT’s partners from different thematics and geographic regions utilized $11.6 million USD for Relief & Resilience response to reach about 900,000 vulnerable people including internally displaced persons and people living with disabilities in different states and regions of Myanmar with multi-sectoral emergency aid. It is the hand-in-hand collaboration with partners that enabled LIFT-funded support to help restore and boost resilient livelihoods while strengthening the food security of vulnerable groups., Nutrition and WASH awareness, In Kachin and Northern Shan, over 12,000 women from the most vulnerable households have been part of LIFT-funded nutrition-sensitive activities which included nutrition and WASH awareness, training in home gardening and in-kind support (food and WASH items)., Improving working conditions for women garment factory workers, Everyday, hundreds of unskilled women come from rural areas to cities to work in one of over 400 garment factories. Working in a garment factory is often the only possibility for young women from rural areas to earn money and become economically independent, and the income they generate is also used to support the families they’ve left behind. However, working in a garment factory also poses several challenges for these young women: while trying to navigate life in a new city without their family, friends and support network, the women also face harsh working conditions in the factory every day. In an effort to improve working conditions for women workers at garment factories, LIFT’s partners initiated a pilot to collaborate with a factory to upgrade its infrastructure by building or renovating canteens, toilets and healthcare facilities as well as installing cooling systems to provide some basic comfort and amenities as well as to create a space where the women are able to interact with each other. Though at its very early stage, the pilot has already proved success as workers appreciated improvements and it resulted in higher productivity and higher incomes.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/conflict-food-insecurity-and-pandemic-triangle-suffering-myanmar

They were told to go to the public hall without being explained why. When they arrived, they were forced to get a COVID-19 vaccination., The security forces that stopped them in Mone Town asked them to show their COVID-19 vaccination certificate. According to Naw A---, “[…] if we had it [a vaccination certificate], they would let us go. If we didn’t have the certificate and if we had not received any dose of COVID-19 vaccination, we were told to go [to the public hall] and get it.” She added that the security forces had guns with them and they would not allow them to refuse getting vaccinated. “We were afraid of them”, she said., After they reached the public hall, they were given a number and asked to stand in a queue according to their number. At the public hall, there were police officers and five to six soldiers, as well as many SAC-appointed senior administrators from the town. According to Naw A---, their health condition was not examined before they were vaccinated and everyone except pregnant women were made to receive the vaccination. Some people told them that they had health issues and were not willing to get the vaccine but they were told to get it anyway. They did not have the option to choose the type of vaccine, and were also not told what type of vaccine was given to them. Naw A--- stated that she does not know who the people administering the vaccination were but believes that they were not nurses or healthcare workers from Moo (Mone) Hospital as most of the hospital staff are participating in the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM)[6]. She added that the people who gave the vaccine were brought by the SAC. The people who vaccinated them also did not explain anything to them following the vaccination but gave them some sort of vaccination certificate that stated when to come back for a second dose., According to Naw A---, soldiers and police officers were present around the hall, carrying guns with them so civilians were afraid and received the vaccination although they did not want to. Naw A--- added, “After we received the vaccination and exited the building, they [the police officers, soldiers, and administrators who were standing outside] laughed [were smiling and seemed amused].” When asked by the KHRG researcher how she felt, she said that she wasn’t satisfied because she felt like she was forced to get a vaccination without wanting to.

Ongoing fighting between the State Administration Council (SAC) and the People’s Defence Force (PDF) across Mergui-Tavoy District resulted in the displacement of many local villagers. Following fighting between the SAC and PDF, SAC soldiers burned down villagers’ houses. Villagers also faced travel restrictions and were questioned and threatened by the SAC at checkpoints when they travelled. COVID-19 has been spreading across the district.[1], Fighting and displacement, On January 19th 2022, fighting occurred in Yay Waing and Pyin K’To villages, K’Mo Thway area, Ler Doh Soh (Dawei) Township, and over 600 villagers have been displaced. Villagers who have been displaced because of the fighting include villagers from Khaung Taing Pyin, Myin Mat Tat, Ku La Khyaung, and Myin Ka Ni villages. They sought refuge in E--- village. On January 20th 2022, fighting broke out again in Ha Myin Gyi village, and some of the villagers there fled to E--- village.

At 9:00 pm, SAC soldiers burned down five houses in Ka Wer village. The villagers whose houses were burned down were Saw U---, Saw V---, Saw W---, Saw X--- and Saw Y---. These villagers were ordinary villagers who work as day labourers and who secure their livelihood by planting betel nut trees. After their houses were burned down, these villagers had to stay with their relatives. [Since the 2021 coup, fighting has been happening frequently in the area.] Whenever there has been fighting between SAC soldiers and the PDF in P’Law area, Ler Muh Lah Township, SAC soldiers have arrested the local people and burned down villagers’ houses., On January 21st 2022, fighting broke out in Ha Myin Gyi village, which is located in the eastern part of Tavoy Town, Ler Doh Soh Township. After the fighting happened and villagers [from the town area] fled from their village, SAC soldiers burned down one of the villagers’ houses and destroyed the betel nut that villagers had harvested. When fighting occurred in Saw Khay Htoh Proh area, K’ser Doh (Thayetchaung) Township in the past SAC soldiers also blocked the road, checked the local villagers and terrorized them. Whenever there was an incident, SAC soldiers would terrorize the local people who lived near the place where the incident took place., Landmine incident, After fighting broke out between the SAC and PDF on January 8th 2022 in Ler Muh Lah Township, SAC soldiers increased their movement in the area during the night. They [SAC soldiers] planted a landmine beside a villager’s house, and at around 5:30 pm on January 23rd 2022, a mother and her child stepped on that landmine. The mother died immediately and the child also died, shortly after being taken to P’Law Hospital. After this incident, fear and worry increased among the villagers., Travel restrictions, Due to the recent fighting, local villagers in K’ser Hkler area in K'Ser Doh Township started facing travel restrictions because SAC soldiers came and set up their checkpoints on the road and threatened civilians. If villagers wanted to travel to other places, they had to go and get a travel recommendation letter from the village head. If villagers went to buy food, SAC soldiers would also check them, ask them questions, and threaten them by accusing them of buying food for the PDF. Another issue that local villagers faced regarding transportation was that they were checked to see whether they had already received the COVID-19 vaccine or not when they travelled. Local villagers in other parts of Mergui-Tavoy District also faced travel restrictions and were checked by the SAC at checkpoints when they travelled from one place to another. The things checked were phones, motorcycle licenses, car licenses, and COVID-19 vaccination certificates., COVID-19 situation, COVID-19 has been spreading throughout the entire district of Mergui-Tavoy, and many people have been infected with the virus. Some of the local people went to get treatment at SAC government hospitals, while others received treatment at private hospitals and clinics, or at the local health centres in KNU-controlled areas. Some villagers just used traditional/herbal medicines [to treat the symptoms]. However, during the period between December 2021 and February 2022, there were no COVID-19 related deaths. The SAC has set up centres for people to get COVID-19 vaccines in every local area [in the district], but no awareness training regarding the COVID-19 vaccination has been provided to local civilians. In KNU-controlled area, a list of local villagers has been collected for the vaccination, but villagers didn’t know when the vaccination program would begin in their local area., Further background reading on the human rights situation in Mergui-Tavoy District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in March 2022.

"Kler Lwee Htoo District Short Update: SAC airstrikes destroyed two houses and resulted in the displacement of villagers in Ler Doh and Hsaw Htee townships, March to April 2022",Situation Report,KHRG,Protection and Human Rights,22 Jun 2022,"This Short Update describes events that occurred in Ler Doh (Kyaukkyi) and Hsaw Htee (Shwegyin) townships, Kler Lwee Htoo (Nyaunglebin) District in March 2022. SAC air forces conducted airstrikes in two respective areas of KNU-controlled Kler Lwee Htoo District on March 19th 2022. There were no casualties among villagers, but the bombs destroyed two houses and resulted in the displacement of villagers living in these areas.[1], On March 19th 2022 at 2:00 am, a jet from the Burma Army [State Administration Council (SAC)[2] military[3]], came and conducted an air strike in A--- place, near B--- village, in Loh Hkee village tract[4], Hsaw Htee (Shwegyin) Township, Kler Lwee Htoo (Nyaunglebin) District. At that same time, they [SAC military] also conducted an air strike in C--- village, Kwee Lah village tract, Ler Doh (Kyaukkyi) Township, Kler Lwee Htoo District. Both incidents took place in areas controlled by the Karen National Union (KNU)[5]/Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[6] Brigade #3. Civilians in both Hsaw Htee and Ler Doh townships fled from their villages and became displaced., According to the villagers, on March 19th at 2:00 am, SAC air forces dropped two bombs in Loh Hkee village tract, Hsaw Htee Township, Kler Lwee Htoo District. The bombs landed on a road between D--- village and B--- village. Two civilians’ houses were damaged from the air strike [while the families were sleeping in the houses], but there were no civilian casualties. The two houses that were damaged from the bomb explosion belong to B---villagers’, Naw[7] E--- and Saw[8] G---. The bomb explosion caused a hole in the roof of Naw E---’s house and two holes in the roof of Saw G---’s house., At the same time, another SAC fighter jet dropped two bombs beside C--- village, Kwee Lah village tract, Ler Doh Township, Kler Lwee Htoo District. There were no casualties during this incident, as the bombs fell and exploded beside the village. However, the roof of a villager’s house that was close to the explosion was damaged [from a piece of shrapnel that came into the village]., According to the villagers, the SAC used two fighter jets for the air strikes [on this day]; one fighter jet dropped two bombs beside B--- village in Hsaw Htee Township, and another fighter jet also dropped two bombs beside C--- village in Ler Doh Township., Displacement during the air strikes, [Due to the air strikes on March 19th,] villagers from C---, D---, H---, J--- and other nearby villages in Hsaw Htee Township had to flee from their villages and displace to safer places in the forest nearby. They no longer dared to sleep in their village and slept in the forest instead. In particular, children and mothers with new-born babies had to confront various challenges, as there was no proper shelter for them to take refuge in the forest. The villagers, who became displaced due to the SAC air strike, were not aware of or informed about the air strike prior to the incident. They were all asleep in their houses in the villages at the time of the incident, and immediately fled from their villages to escape, [following] the air strike., Since then, from the beginning of April to April 30th, villagers in over half of the villages from Hsaw Htee Township have had to displace to forests to save their lives [due to ongoing military activity]. They still do not dare to return to their villages to sleep over night, as they worry that the SAC might conduct air strikes again and enter KNU-controlled areas to attack the KNLA., The air strikes that were conducted by the SAC have led to villagers becoming fearful. The villagers are afraid to engage in their livelihoods, travel and carry out other [day to day activities]., [KHRG has also documented and published an incident where the SAC conducted an air strike on March 30th 2021 at Moe Aung gold mining site, located in Meh Theh Hkee place near Htee Hpa Doh village, Meh Yeh Hkee village tract, Hsaw Htee Township. It killed eight mine workers and a KNLA radio operator; two others were injured (one mine worker and a member of the KNU Forestry Department).[9]], As well as conducting air strikes in Kler Lwee Htoo District, the SAC air forces conducted several air strikes into civilian places in KNU-controlled areas in Doo Tha Htoo, Mu Traw and Dooplaya districts in 2021 and these types of incidents continue at the time of reporting in April 2022., Further background reading on the situation on human rights violations in Kler Lwee Htoo District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in March and April 2022.

"Death sentences announced by Myanmar military may constitute a serious international crime – Statement by Nicholas Koumjian, Head of Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,20 Jun 2022,"Geneva, 20 June 2022 – The Independent Mechanism for Myanmar is closely following events surrounding the recent announcement by the Myanmar military that it intends to carry out death sentences imposed on four individuals by military courts following non-public trials. Imposing a death sentence, or even a period of detention, on the basis of proceedings that do not satisfy the basic requirements of a fair trial may constitute one or more crimes against humanity or war crimes., The Myanmar military announced on 3 June 2022 that it intends to execute four individuals who have been sentenced to death by a military court. The available information strongly suggests that under international law, fundamental rights of the convicted persons were blatantly violated in these proceedings. One of the most fundamental attributes of a fair trial is that it be held in public to the greatest extent possible. Exceptions based on national security or other considerations must be limited to the extent that they are strictly justified.[1] Yet it appears that there were no public proceedings nor are the judgments publicly available. The secrecy of proceedings is itself a violation of one of the most basic principles of a fair trial, and casts doubt on whether any of the other fair trial guarantees have been respected, such as the requirement that the tribunal was impartial and independent., Imposing a prison or death sentence in such circumstances could constitute crimes against humanity or war crimes. The crime against humanity of persecution is the severe denial of a person’s fundamental rights under international law when committed on discriminatory grounds, such as a person’s political affiliation. Imprisonment as a crime against humanity is committed when a person is detained without due process of law, including in violation of fundamental rules of international law. It is also a war crime to impose sentences and carry out executions without a judgement by a regularly constituted court, affording all judicial guarantees which are generally recognized as indispensable. National laws or procedures relied upon to justify a conviction and sentence must not violate international law., In particularly egregious situations, such as those presented in the Nuremberg case of Altstötter* et al*., the imposition of the death penalty following proceedings that blatantly violate basic fair trial rights – including holding such proceedings entirely in secret and without proper records – can lead to the inference of a “mock trial” that “is not a judicial proceeding but a murder.”[2] The participation of those involved in such proceedings is not excused on the basis that they were merely following domestic law. Even judges and prosecutors, as in the Altstötter case, can be found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity for their roles in such proceedings., The Mechanism will continue to monitor and collect evidence in relation to these cases, and any other cases involving the imposition of the death penalty in circumstances that appear to violate fundamental fair trial guarantees., ­­­­­­­­­, The Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar (The Mechanism) is mandated to collect evidence of the most serious international crimes committed in Myanmar and to prepare files that can facilitate prosecutions of those responsible in national or international courts, For more information contact: iimm@un.org, [1] UN Human Rights Committee, General Comment No. 32 (Art. 14), CCPR/C/GC/32, para. 29 (“the judgment, including the essential findings, evidence and legal reasoning must be made public”)., [2] United States v.

ICRC Regional Director for Asia Pacific visits Myanmar,News and Press Release,ICRC,Protection and Human Rights,20 Jun 2022,"International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Regional Director for the Asia Pacific Christine Cipolla visited Myanmar last week for meetings with State Administration Council ministries, including the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Ministry of Health. The meetings followed up on key humanitarian concerns and requests expressed by ICRC President Peter Maurer during his visit to Myanmar in June 2021., During the meetings in Nay Pyi Taw from June 15 to 18, the Regional Director discussed ICRC's humanitarian response and expressed deep concern about worsening armed conflicts and other situations of violence in states and regions across the country, as well as the escalating toll on civilians., At times when working conditions for the ICRC are increasingly challenging and access to hundreds of thousands of people in need of urgent help remains very limited, the Regional Director called for the facilitation of humanitarian responses in Chin, Kayah and Kayin States, as well as in Magway or Sagaing regions, including in areas where ethnic armed organizations are present. Regarding Rakhine State, she also emphasized that after more than eighteen months without major clashes and while COVID-19 preventive measures are being progressively lifted, restrictions over humanitarian access that have been in place since early 2019 should be re-assessed., ""Many communities displaced by violence are in dire need of basic necessities – such as food, water and shelter – and have no access to healthcare and other essential services. Parties to the conflict must do their utmost to facilitate the rapid and unimpeded passage of neutral and impartial humanitarian relief,"" the Regional Director said. ""I reiterated ICRC's offer to do more for those people most in need in both old and new areas of conflict, as ICRC is one of the few organizations able to work in today's very difficult security environment and who enjoys the trust of all sides""., During her visit, the Regional Director also called for the earliest possible resumption of ICRC and family visits in prisons, both suspended by Myanmar authorities in March 2020, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide., ""Capitalising on the recent improvement of the COVID-19 situation and at a time of growing concerns and distress of families of detainees, I asked for the gradual resumption of our humanitarian visits and underlined the importance of allowing families to be in contact with their loved ones in prison as soon as possible,"" the Regional Director said., The ICRC regrets that no agreement on these two points was found yet with the detaining authorities but remains determined to continue its action in support of people detained and their families., In the framework of ICRC's bilateral and confidential dialogue with all parties to the conflicts, the Regional Director also shared the ICRC's view on issues pertaining to respect of International Humanitarian Law and other applicable standards on the use of force by armed and security forces., Finally, the ICRC Regional Director met with the leadership of the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) to discuss further cooperation and coordination at a time of growing humanitarian needs. She emphasized the importance of building on the complementarity of the ICRC and the MRCS respective mandates, expertise and capabilities to assist more people, particularly in hard to reach areas. In the current polarized environment, both organizations reiterated their commitment to uphold principled humanitarian action and to act in line with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement's Fundamental Principles of impartiality, neutrality and independence.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/icrc-regional-director-asia-pacific-visits-myanmar

Shelter and Non-Food Items",6 Jun 2022,"Overview, The events of 1 February 2021, and the ensuing political and security related developments, had a significant impact on UNHCR operations and on people of concern in 2021. By year-end, the population of concern to UNHCR stood at 1.2 million people - 51 percent more compared to the end of 2020. The overall situation has been further exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which continues to affect people of concern - particularly in view of the already strained/disrupted health services, as well as by cyclical natural hazards such as flooding. Furthermore, the situation for the 600,000 Rohingya and stateless populations or people at risk of statelessness in Rakhine State remained largely unchanged with slim prospects for a comprehensive and lasting solution to their plight. Despite immense challenges faced over the year, UNHCR continued to address the most pressing humanitarian needs to assess the protection environment and to mobilize partners to place protection and solutions at the center of their humanitarian action.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-2021-key-achievements-31-december-2021
Op-ed for World Refugee Day 2022,News and Press Release,UNHCR,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",20 Jun 2022,"Solidarity with displaced populations and host communities in Myanmar needed more than ever, Every year on World Refugee Day, the international community comes together to celebrate the strength and resilience of those forced to flee their homes as well as the host communities who welcome them. For my colleagues and I at UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, it is an opportunity for us to reaffirm our commitment in supporting the people of Myanmar., Solidarity for Myanmar is needed now more than ever amid a growing humanitarian crisis. The realities are sobering. In addition to pre-existing conflict-affected populations, hundreds of thousands more have been displaced across the country in the past year., As conflict intensifies, the UN projects that the rate of displacement is likely to increase for the foreseeable future. While tens of thousands have sought safety in neighbouring countries like India and Thailand as refugees, the vast majority remain in Myanmar as internally displaced people (IDPs)., The challenges faced by those displaced are numerous. Conditions have deteriorated while vulnerabilities have increased as instability has led to disruptions in health services, food assistance, livelihood opportunities, banking systems and telecommunications. Armed conflict has also impeded the ability of affected populations to seek safety and urgent lifesaving assistance., Yet, in the face of so much adversity lies the incredible strength of the human spirit. While the challenges and obstacles faced by the people of Myanmar are regularly reported, much less talked about are the stories of courage, solidarity and resilience displayed everyday by individuals., Acts of kindness and generosity are abound. Whenever my colleagues and I go into the field to distribute humanitarian supplies, IDPs often tell us that they will only take what they need and urge us to give the rest to those in greater need - a beautiful display of empathy and compassion despite many having lost their homes, travelling long distances and sometimes losing family members to conflict., The assistance UNHCR provides is part of a wider collective effort undertaken by the humanitarian community to support those forced to flee. Just as impressive as the acts by IDPs themselves, are the numerous examples of host communities and local organizations stepping up and acting as first responders. We are all touched by the hospitality offered by monasteries, churches, schools, community halls and even strangers’ homes, welcoming displaced people with open arms and hearts so that they can have shelter, food and safety., UNHCR continually emphasizes that our assistance merely complements what courageous individuals and caring communities are doing to help those displaced by conflict. As part of our commitment to stay and deliver, we continue to work round the clock to deliver lifesaving aid. In 2021 alone, core relief items, including kitchen sets, blankets, sleeping mats and solar lamps, among other items, reached 182,000 people, while 113,000 benefitted from shelter support. Furthermore, an additional 100,000 people were reached in the first six months of 2022., Despite these efforts, much work remains to be done. Humanitarian organisations face many constraints, including access limitations and insecurity, in the delivery of assistance and protection services to people in most need. Of particular challenge is reaching those located in rural and difficult-to-access areas where food, clean water, shelter and basic household items are in short supply., Every person has a right to seek safety. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that people have access to safety and their basic needs met. Together with our sister UN agencies, we continue advocacy efforts to facilitate safe and unimpeded humanitarian access to ensure that no one gets left behind., Our responsibility does not end there. Once out of harm’s way, we need to ensure that displaced people continue to feel safe and treated with respect and dignity. As the current crisis persists, affected communities are at-risk of finding themselves in a situation of prolonged displacement – a state of limbo exponentially increasing their vulnerability. As community support capacities weaken over time, the need to strengthen programming around resilience building becomes ever more critical., In this vein, UNHCR will endeavour to mitigate risks faced by IDPs, returnees and host communities by building their resilience in an inclusive manner, while facilitating critical life-saving assistance and protection services. We are here to stay and here to deliver together with partners, committing ourselves to protect those forced to flee and provide vital live-saving assistance to people in need across Myanmar., Hai Kyung Jun is the Representative of UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, in Myanmar.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/op-ed-world-refugee-day-2022

By 2020, more than one million people received a total of 35.6 million USD worth of CVA, distributed by 63 organisations nationwide. Even so, government acceptance of CVA was not uniform in all contexts and sectors of implementation., On 1st February 2021, the Myanmar military overthrew the government in a coup d’état.

Localisation in Myanmar: Supporting and reinforcing Myanmar actors [EN/MY],Analysis,Crown Agents,Coordination,15 Jun 2022,"I. THIS REPORT, 1. Purpose, This report explores the question of whether and how to support [further] localisation in the current conditions in Myanmar, which are assumed to remain similar for the next few years. It does this primarily from the perspective of international aid actors who, through their funding, hold much power over Myanmar actors. But it also speaks to what Myanmar actors need to do or do more of. Ihe report addresses questions such as: What do we understand by ‘localisation’? Why should we see this as an objective globally and in Myanmar specifically? What does it mean in practice, for example regarding funding, capacities, standards, risks, coordination, and political positioning? It provides recommendations for actions, based on clearer reflection on the why and how of localisation., 2. Target audience, Its target audience are all international and national/local actors responding to the crises in Myanmar today. This includes donors, the UN agencies, the Red Cross agencies, international NGOs [INGO] and the different Myanmar actors. Most international actors operating in Myanmar have formally subscribed to the Grand Bargain commitments. While focused on humanitarian action, their intention equally applies to development and peace actors. Turning these into practice is a collective responsibility., 3. Sources, The report draws on several sources: A ‘state of localisation in Myanmar’ assessment, itself drawing on relevant documents and interviews conducted in late 2020': a 2021 review of how the Humanitarian Assistance and Resilience Facility [HARP-F] put the localisation commitment into practice; other reviews commissioned and reflective webinars hosted by the HARP-F in 2021 and 2022; short conversations with other funding instruments that continue to operate in Myanmar, notably the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund (MHF], Access to Health ([A2H}; LIFT (Livelinood and Food Security Fund) and the Nexus Response Mechanism [NRM]; earlier and other work by RAFT Myanmar and the Global Mentoring Initiative [GMI] in Myanmar; and GMI's involvement in global work on localisation and programming in volatile environments, and what is being learned from that., 4. Limitations and value, Due to the challenges of the current context in Myanmar, primary research for this study was conducted remotely. Shorter online interviews cannot substitute for observing meetings, actions in progress and being present to speak both formally and informally with many more people than those deemed ‘key informants’. The report cannot have the in-depth and up-to-date insights that agencies operating in Myanmar will have. Its value lies in its comprehensive perspective on localisation and the connection with a wider learning that is relevant for it. Lack of a comprehensive perspective can be one impediment for more intentional and collective action to turn the locatisation commitment into practice., 5. Structure of the report, The second section provides a very Summary picture of Myanmar as a protracted and currently deepening crisis. The third section situates the question of internationalisation or localisation at the strategic level and that of the collective of all responders. It appreciates the dilemmas all face in the current circumstances, and invites clarity about the why of localisation, what we mean with it, and what success would look like. section four examines how localisation is or must be turned into practice in key areas: the quality of collaboration, financing, capacities, and coordination. Section 5 presents recommendations to international actors but also to Myanmar CSOs. The report offers a systematic structure of reflection useful for all actors - and illustrates many aspects with references to the HARP-F practices, in text boxes. Recommendations appear in sections 3, 4 and 5 following the issue-specific reflections and findings. They are grouped together in a separate ‘summary’ document. Several are relatively short term - as localisation has been extensively discussed and researched for years now, and the current challenging situation in Myanmar has existed for 15 months already.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/localisation-myanmar-supporting-and-reinforcing-myanmar-actors-enmy

HARP-F Functionality Review,Evaluation and Lessons Learned,Crown Agents,"Coordination
Humanitarian Financing",15 Jun 2022,"Executive Summary, The Humanitarian Assistance and Resilience Programme Facility (HARP-F) has been the principal pillar of the UK’s humanitarian assistance in Myanmar. Launched in 2016, the Facility acted as both a grantfunding mechanism and a knowledge platform for the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO, formerly DFID). It is managed through a contract with Crown Agents. The facility provides funding for humanitarian assistance on behalf of the UK government, with the FCDO involved in strategic decisions and some approvals, but has its own distinct identity and is managerially and operationally independent. Until 2021, the UK Aid branding was not used by HARP-F partners in relation to HARP-F funds, to allow the Facility impartiality. This contributed to perceptions that the HARP Facility and the FCDO were separate entities.
As part of HARP-F knowledge component, a functional review was commissioned, in order to understand how the design, processes and structures of HARP-F have contributed to its ability to deliver humanitarian assistance and its impact, and to provide forward-looking recommendations that discuss how the benefits of HARP-F can be sustained in future funding for localised humanitarian responses in Myanmar.

Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction",15 Jun 2022,"It has been a decade since intercommunal violence began causing waves of displacement in Rakhine State, Myanmar – disrupting lives and livelihoods for thousands of people. COVID-19 and the military intervention has further increased the need for humanitarian support., Some people, like 54-year-old Kyaw Aye Thein, have been working with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as part of a new programme that helps displaced families support themselves despite the overlapping humanitarian challenges they face., Kyaw Aye Thein, who used to work as a labourer, was forced to leave his home, along with thousands of others, because of ongoing clashes, seeking shelter in a camp for displaced people in Rathedaung., Years earlier, Kyaw Aye Thein had lost his leg after stepping on a landmine. Finding work after life has been disrupted by conflict can be hard. Living with a disability can make that search even more complex., But working alongside the ICRC as part of programme that provides cash grants and vocational training to people living with disabilities in areas affected by conflict has helped give Kyaw Aye Thein the renewed start he needs., With support from our physical rehabilitation team, Kyaw Aye Thein received his first prosthesis in April 2021. Since then, together with the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS), we have organized a series of training sessions and provided grants that have helped Kyaw Aye Thein to start a small grocery store, ensuring a sustainable income., Kyaw Aye Thein was one of the 13 people using the services of the physical rehabilitation centre in Sittwe who participated in this pilot programme, which included a two-day business skills training workshop. Opening a grocery store was his idea., ""Our teams helped Kyaw Aye Thein hone the plan and provided opportunities for him to learn the basics of financial management, accounting and marketing,"" says Zin Min Htike, who works with the ICRC in Yangon., ""These were new skills for Kyaw Aye Thein and helped him to turn his business idea into a reality."", Kyaw Aye Thein's grocery store began as a wooden extension to his house in the displacement camp. Now, he's able to source grocery items from a wholesaler to serve the entire community., Going forward, Kyaw Aye Thein plans to save up to eventually expand his business and also cover emergency needs in case clashes break out again. He is one of many people living with a disability in Myanmar who we work with, supporting them to participate fully in society and earn sustainable livelihoods.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-ensuring-sustainable-livelihoods-all

ILO Myanmar calls for more action to end child labour,News and Press Release,ILO,Protection and Human Rights,14 Jun 2022,"This World Day Against Child Labour on June 12, taking place shortly after the 5th Global Conference on the Elimination of Child Labour, ILO Myanmar calls to accelerate multi-stakeholder efforts to prevent and eliminate child labour, with priority given to the worst forms of child labour., Yangon (ILO News) - In line with the Durban Call to Action adopted last month, ILO Myanmar expresses its continued commitment to make decent work a reality for adults and youth above the minimum age for work., Almost one in ten of Myanmar’s 12 million children between the age of 5 and 17 are engaged in child labour, often exposed to hazards and risks. The compounded impact of the military takeover and persistent armed conflicts on top of the COVID-19 pandemic had led to an estimated 1.6 million jobs lost in Myanmar in 2021, heightening the risk of families resorting to child labour., According to a recent report by the ILO, it is estimated that the incidence of child labour in countries affected by armed conflict was 77 per cent higher than the global average, and the incidence of hazardous work was 50 per cent higher. This suggests that the current context in Myanmar will exacerbate child labour., “The unstable political landscape and deteriorating economic situation in Myanmar have forced more and more families into poverty. In times of crisis, concerted efforts among all stakeholders are needed more than ever before to increase social protections to prevent and protect children from child labour in all forms,” said Mr Donglin Li, ILO Myanmar Liaison Officer/Representative., ILO action in Myanmar, Drawing on this year’s World Day Against Child Labour theme, “Universal Social Protection to End Child Labour”, ILO Myanmar will engage with civil society, development partners and social partners in training and awareness-raising activities through its e-learning programme and interventions., Some of the actions include panel discussions, community based events, awareness-raising videos, a drawing contest and a photo exhibition “Burning Hands ” (Institut Français de Birmanie), which will take place throughout June to August.

Myanmar: The Rohingya’s Decade of Detention,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,15 Jun 2022,"No Justice for Crimes Against Humanity Committed Since 2012, (Bangkok) – The Myanmar authorities have detained over 135,000 Rohingya and Kaman Muslims arbitrarily and indefinitely in Rakhine State for a decade, Human Rights Watch said in a web feature released today. Drawing on interviews with Rohingya and humanitarian workers from 2012 to the present, Human Rights Watch documents how the authorities have capitalized on the ethnic cleansing campaign launched in June 2012 to segregate and confine a population they had long sought to remove from daily life in the predominantly Buddhist country., Through individual accounts, images, and video, “‘Nothing Called Freedom’: A Decade of Detention for Rohingya in Myanmar’s Rakhine State” illustrates the Myanmar authorities’ crimes against humanity of apartheid, persecution, and imprisonment that have deprived Rohingya of their liberty and threatened their lives and livelihoods., “The Myanmar junta’s unyielding oppression of the Rohingya people is the foreseeable result of the military facing no consequences for its decade of ethnic cleansing and system of apartheid,” said Shayna Bauchner, Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Concerned governments should now be doing what they should have done in 2012 – pursuing all avenues to hold Myanmar officials accountable for their grave crimes and delivering justice to the victims of their abuses.”, Following the June 2012 violence, township and border guard officials began forcing Rohingya to move to camps that were soon sealed off with barbed wire fencing and military checkpoints. Severe constraints on movement, livelihoods, and access to humanitarian aid and health care have only worsened over the past decade, compounded by inhuman living conditions. Accounts from the camps and humanitarian agency documents reveal a growing tally of preventable deaths., The 2012 violence and resulting displacement coincided with Myanmar’s nascent transition to democratic civilian rule. Increased oppression in both policy and practice inflamed anti-Muslim sentiment throughout the country, which laid the groundwork for the more brutal and organized military atrocities of 2016 and 2017. Foreign governments, rather than seeking to hold accountable those responsible for the violence and ensuing apartheid state, began lifting sanctions and positioning themselves for the country’s political and economic opening-up., Instead, in February 2021, the security forces staged a coup and detained the country’s civilian leaders, thrusting Myanmar back under military rule. The junta has responded to broad-based opposition with a brutal nationwide crackdown that reflects the tactics long employed in Rakhine State., The coup has brought new movement restrictions and aid blockages to the Rohingya camps. Rising tensions and fighting in Rakhine State between the Myanmar military and the ethnic-Rakhine Arakan Army have left the Rohingya caught in the middle., The United Nations Human Rights Council and UN member states, at the June 15, 2022 panel discussion and in the proposed resolution on the Rohingya, should advance a strategy for accountability in Myanmar that dismantles the military’s longstanding impunity for grave abuses., “A decade is a grim milestone for the 135,000 Rohingya detained in Myanmar’s camps whose accounts of deprivation receive scarce international attention,” Bauchner said. “Sharing these stories and images is a way to remind governments of the staggering human cost of apartheid and persecution.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-rohingyas-decade-detention
International coalition of Parliamentarians launches Inquiry into global response to Myanmar coup,News and Press Release,APHR,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",15 Jun 2022,"JAKARTA – Despite pledges to oppose the overthrow of the democratically elected government of Myanmar and hold the country’s abusive military to account, international actors have failed to take the necessary steps to force the junta to negotiate a political solution, failed to address the mounting humanitarian needs, and failed to bring about the necessary diplomatic coordination to prevent Myanmar from becoming a failed state, a newly established international parliamentary inquiry said today., The International Parliamentary Inquiry into the International Response to the Coup in Myanmar (IPI), chaired by Heidi Hautala, Vice-President of the European Parliament, brings together members of parliaments from Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas to investigate the international response to the crisis triggered by the coup d’état in Myanmar and where it is failing. The members of the committee form a truly international panel that has come together because of their common concern to protect the rights of the most vulnerable., “The response to the devastating crisis unfolding in Myanmar is going nowhere fast,” said Hautala. “As parliamentarians, we know that governments and international institutions can, and must, do more to end the current impasse. These hearings aim to shed light on where the response is falling short, and to provide information on the next steps that can be taken to put effective pressure on the Myanmar junta.”, The IPI is an initiative of ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR). It will follow the format of tried-and-tested parliamentary inquiries conducted at a national level. In addition to requesting information from individual governments and international organizations, the IPI will accept both written and oral submissions of testimony and evidence from a variety of stakeholders., “We are concerned that international institutions have not lived up to their own promises, and we are appalled that the situation in Myanmar is worsening the longer the international inertia continues,” said Charles Santiago, Chair of APHR. “We, as parliamentarians from all over the world united by a common purpose, will approach this inquiry unhindered by the type of geopolitical considerations that have resulted in the current deadlock.”, The violence, death, and suffering being caused as a result of the Myanmar coup continues to escalate and intensify in the absence of adequate international efforts to alleviate the suffering of the Myanmar people. In January, the U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, stated that the international response had been “ineffectual and lacks a sense of urgency commensurate to the magnitude of the crisis.”, “The Burmese people have clearly and courageously demonstrated their aspiration for democracy”, stated Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who will be participating from the United States. “They do not want a military government.

Protection and Human Rights",14 Jun 2022,"GENEVA (14 June 2022) – The Myanmar military junta has brutally attacked and killed children and systematically abused their human rights, a UN expert said in a report released today that calls for immediate coordinated action to protect the rights of children and safeguard Myanmar’s future., “The junta’s relentless attacks on children underscore the generals’ depravity and willingness to inflict immense suffering on innocent victims in its attempt to subjugate the people of Myanmar,” said Tom Andrews, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar., “The international community’s approach to the coup and the junta’s atrocities has failed. States must take immediate coordinated action to address an escalating political, economic and humanitarian crisis that is putting Myanmar’s children at risk of becoming a lost generation.”, The Special Rapporteur said it was clear from the evidence that the children of Myanmar were not only being caught in the crossfire of escalating attacks, but that they were often the targets of the violence., “During my fact-finding for this report, I received information about children who were beaten, stabbed, burned with cigarettes, and subjected to mock executions, and who had their fingernails and teeth pulled out during lengthy interrogation sessions,” Andrews said., “The junta’s attacks on children constitute crimes against humanity and war crimes. Junta leader Min Aung Hlaing and other architects of the violence in Myanmar must be held accountable for their crimes against children,” he said., “For the sake of Myanmar’s children, Member States, regional organisations, the Security Council, and other UN entities must respond to the crisis in Myanmar with the same urgency they have responded to the crisis in Ukraine.”, Andrews urged Member States to work in coordination to alleviate the suffering of children by systematically increasing pressure on the junta. He urged States that have already imposed sanctions on the military and military-linked companies to take stronger coordinated action that will inhibit the junta’s ability to finance atrocities., “States must pursue stronger targeted economic sanctions and coordinated financial investigations. I urge Member States to commit to a dramatic increase in humanitarian assistance and unequivocal regional support for refugees,” he said., “It is scandalous that the international community has committed only 10 percent of the funds required to implement the Myanmar Humanitarian Response Plan 2022, causing lifesaving programs for children to be shelved,” he said., The Special Rapporteur’s report describes the impact of the 1 February 2021 coup on the human rights of children in Myanmar and details the alarming, underreported facts of the violence being perpetrated against them. Soldiers, police officers and military-backed militias have murdered, abducted, detained and tortured children in a campaign of violence that has touched every corner of the country, the report said., Over the past 16 months, the military has killed at least 142 children in Myanmar. Over 250,000 children have been displaced by the military’s attacks and over 1,400 have been arbitrarily detained. At least 61 children, including several under three years of age, are reportedly being held as hostages. The UN has documented the torture of 142 children since the coup., The junta has intentionally deprived children of their fundamental human rights to health, education and development, with an estimated 7.8 million children out of school. Following the collapse of the public health system since the coup, the World Health Organization projects that 33,000 children will die preventable deaths in 2022 because they have not received routine immunizations., Andrews said the lack of action by Security Council was a moral failure with profound repercussions for children in the country., “World leaders, diplomats and donors should ask themselves why the world is failing to do all that can reasonably be done to bring an end to the suffering of the children of Myanmar,” the expert said., ENDS, Mr. Thomas Andrews is the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar., The Special Rapporteurs, Independent Experts and Working Groups are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system, is the general name of the Council’s independent fact-finding and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or thematic issues in all parts of the world.

Protection and Human Rights",14 Jun 2022,"DELIVERED BY Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Distinguished Vice-President,, Excellencies,, Since my last update to this Council in February this year, the human rights situation in Myanmar has continued to rapidly decline. Still suffering from the devastating consequences of the February 2021 military coup, the people of Myanmar remain trapped in a cycle of poverty and displacement, human rights violations and abuses., What we are witnessing today is the systematic and widespread use of tactics against civilians, in respect of which there are reasonable grounds to believe the commission of crimes against humanity and war crimes., Since February 2021, at least 1,900 killings by the military have been reported. The humanitarian situation is dire. One million individuals have been registered by the UN as internally displaced while some 14 million remain in urgent need of humanitarian assistance., The military coup has crippled Myanmar’s economy, with millions losing their jobs or sources of income in the last year. The value of the national currency has plummeted, and prices of essential goods have surged., Internet shutdowns imposed by the military across large parts of the country, and the harassment and prosecution of journalists and individuals reporting on human rights have severely limited information flows and civic space., Nevertheless, my Office continues to monitor and document the scale and magnitude of violations on the ground., Excellencies,, Despite the commitments made by the military to ASEAN, senseless violence in Myanmar has intensified, with scant provision for civilian protection or respect for international human rights and humanitarian laws by the military. Recent military operations in the south-eastern states of Kayin and Kayah, the north-western state of Chin, and the central regions of Sagaing and Magway have amplified the suffering of civilians., Local residents are often detained, and in some cases may have been forcibly disappeared or used as human shields. A well-documented tactic of the military is the burning of entire villages, residential buildings, schools, houses of worship, and other objects specially protected under international humanitarian law. Some estimate over 11,000 such sites have been burned since the attempted coup began last year. Food stocks and other basic supplies have also been destroyed., At the same time, the military continues to apply its so-called “four cuts” strategy to punish the local civilian population and to alienate those who refuse to accept their attempted seizure of power., I am deeply troubled by reports which indicate that the Tatmadaw is trying to militarize whole communities, by expanding its allied local militia organizations, and formalizing military control of police forces. My Office has also received reports that they have launched an initiative to enlist local fire-fighters, Red Cross workers and other public service groups into the security apparatus., In the face of such repression and violence, I respect the strength and resolve of Myanmar’s people, who continue to reject and resist the military and their attempts to assert control. Daily peaceful protests throughout the country and efforts to boycott services provided by military-run governmental institutions remain ongoing after almost 500 days., These peaceful expressions of dissent, however, are met with the continued use of arbitrary arrest and detention. Since 1 February 2021, more than 13,500 people, including politicians, media professionals, lawyers, civil society leaders and other members of civil society, have reportedly been arrested for opposing the Tatmadaw’s purported seizure of power. More than 10,500 remain in detention., Former detainees have reported the frequent use of torture and ill-treatment in military bases, police stations and other places of detention. Arrest warrants have allegedly been issued against another 1,900 individuals., In a recent concerning development, a military spokesperson announced the intention of executing four death sentences, including of two prominent democracy activists. Myanmar has not carried out court-ordered executions for approximately 30 years. I urgently call on military authorities to refrain from such a regressive step which would not only violate the right to life but will further set back prospects for political reconciliation., Excellencies,, In Rakhine State, the situation is critical, with the Arakan Army and Tatmadaw seemingly on the verge of renewing armed conflict. Since last November, there have been regular ripples of violence between the two parties and public verbal exchanges have been increasingly hostile., Members of the Rohingya Muslim community are caught in the middle. There have been no concrete and systematic efforts to work with the Rohingya to solve the longstanding human rights abuses, discrimination and exclusionary practices that have plagued their communities for decades. Added to this, conditions in Rakhine State remain far from adequate for Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh, or for those who have been living in internal displacement camps in Myanmar for 10 years now, to return to their homes., Instead, the military has continued to use hostile and derogatory language to threaten and marginalize the Rohingya and to implement strict discriminatory limitations on their movement. In the past weeks, over 300 Rohingya have been arrested for traveling, what they call, ‘illegally’ outside their communities. Hundreds have been prosecuted and sentenced to prison terms up to two years for exercising their basic right to freedom of movement., On 21 May, another boat capsized near the coast of Pathein township, just south of Rakhine State, resulting in at least 17 deaths, many of whom were children. UNHCR has reported that since the beginning of the year, at least 630 Rohingya have attempted desperate sea journeys to escape violence, the vast majority women and children., Excellencies,, The lives and future of Myanmar’s people are hanging in the balance. It is extremely disappointing to note that international efforts to rein in the military’s recklessly violent approach have been largely ineffective. The ASEAN five-point plan seems to have produced limited results to date since its adoption in April 2021. I urge ASEAN and its members to continue engaging with all relevant national stakeholders, including representatives of the National Unity Government and of civil society., Additionally, the military has been allowed to veto efforts to generate dialogue and political engagement. The National Unity Government of Myanmar - established by democratically elected leaders and with the vast support of the people - has been excluded from discussions., Today I call for sustained and concrete action by all parties to stem the violence. The targeting of civilians and the burning of villages must stop now. The protection of civilians is an absolute imperative, and access must be granted for vital humanitarian assistance to reach all communities. Any solution to this crisis has to be built on broad-based consultation with all stakeholders in the democratic movement and with ethnic minority groups. A climate in which productive political discussions can take place to advance this priority is urgently required. I urge all Member States, particularly those with the highest-level access and influence, to intensify their pressure on the military leadership. Available measures include placing increased restrictions targeting military-controlled financial holdings and business interests, and limiting their access to foreign currencies to restrict their ability to purchase military equipment and supplies., I also call for continued support to the efforts underway to pursue accountability for the ongoing and past serious human rights violations, as well as alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, through all available tracks., Myanmar’s future depends on addressing the root causes of this crisis. Its people deserve a return to democracy, an end to impunity and the immediate cessation of the systemic discrimination that has persecuted minorities – in particular the Rohingya - for decades. They are counting on this Council’s support., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/50th-session-human-rights-council-oral-update-myanmar-14-june-2022

Fiftieth session
13 June–8 July 2022, Summary, Myanmar’s junta is at war with the people of Myanmar, and children are the war’s innocent victims. Without a prompt return to the path of democracy and concerted remedial action, Myanmar’s children will become a lost generation.
The military’s 1 February 2021 coup has meant disaster for Myanmar’s children., Military attacks on civilian populations have displaced more than 250,000 children, who join the roughly 130,000 children in protracted displacement and the more than half million child refugees from Myanmar in neighboring countries. The junta has arbitrarily detained over 1,400 children with at least 61 children currently being held hostage by the junta. Junta forces have tortured at least 142 children since the coup was launched. They have beaten, cut and stabbed children, burned them with cigarettes, forced them to hold stress positions, subjected them to mock executions, and deprived them of food and water. 33,000 children could die preventable deaths in 2022 alone, merely because they have not received routine immunizations. 1.3 million children and more than 700,000 pregnant or breastfeeding women require nutritional support. 7.8 million children remain out of school., The relentless attacks on children underscore the depths of the military junta’s depravity and its willingness to inflict immense misery and hardship on innocent victims to try and subjugate the people of Myanmar. The suffering of children is further reason why the international community must rethink and reset its response to the worsening crisis in Myanmar. The world must return its attention to Myanmar and commit to doing everything reasonably possible to ensure that Myanmar’s children are able to enjoy fundamental human rights, starting with the right to life., Member States, regional organizations, the Security Council, and other UN entities must respond to the crisis in Myanmar with the same urgency they have responded to the crisis in Ukraine. This requires a dramatic increase in humanitarian assistance and unequivocal regional support for refugees. It requires stronger and more unified targeted economic sanctions and coordinated financial investigations. It requires Member States that have imposed relatively little or no pressure on the junta to reassess their positions and take action. It requires Security Council Members to finally put a resolution forward for consideration, debate and a vote.
The stakes for Myanmar’s children, and for Myanmar’s future, could not be higher.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/losing-generation-how-military-junta-devastating-myanmars-children-and-undermining-myanmars-future-conference-room-paper-special-rapporteur-situation-human-rights-myanmar-ahrc50crp1

Shelter and Non-Food Items",14 Jun 2022,"Summary, This case study summarises an analysis conducted by the Civil Health and Development Network (CHDN), Karenni National Women’s Organisation (KNWO), and International Rescue Committee (IRC) to assess the Value for Money of emergency food distribution in Myanmar in 2021., Context and Background, Following the coup d’état in Myanmar in February 2021, renewed armed conflict across many parts of the country resulted in large-scale displacement. Over 100,000 people in Kayah (Karenni) State were internally displaced and in urgent need of food, medicine, warm clothes, blankets, shelter, WASH and protection services. Humanitarian access restrictions, internet and phone disruptions, poor road conditions, COVID-19-related travel restrictions, and other bureaucratic impediments have hindered emergency response and the transportation of goods and supplies (ACAPS)., To address the emergency needs of internally displaced people (IDPs), the Civil Health and Development Network (CHDN) and Karenni National Women’s Organisation (KNWO) were supported by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) to implement the Kayah Integrated Nutrition (KIN) project funded by the Livelihoods and Food Security Fund (LIFT). The project provided food, medicine, WASH, and shelter support in Loikaw, Demoso, Bawlake, Hpasaung, Hpruso, Mese, Pekhon, and Shardaw townships in Kayah State in 2021., In assessing the Value for Money (VfM) of the project, the Economy, Efficiency, and Effectiveness analyses focused on emergency food distribution activities, since these represented the greatest proportion of costs. The analysis results were used to assess how resources were spent on achieving quality results (i.e., compare expenditure with performance), identify drivers of costs and efficiency, and identify lessons to maximise reach and impact per dollar spent.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/livelihoods-and-food-security-fund-lift-kayah-integrated-nutrition-kin-project-myanmar-emergency-food-distribution-2021-value-money-analysis-april-2022
Remarks by Special Envoy Noeleen Heyzer at the informal meeting of the General Assembly on Myanmar (13 June 2022),News and Press Release,UN DPPA,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",13 Jun 2022,"As delivered, Madame Vice-President,
Distinguished Delegates,, It is an honour to address the General Assembly in my capacity as the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Myanmar., The General Assembly has played a critical role in providing comprehensive support to the people of Myanmar, including through the Special Envoy’s mandate, which was established in 2018 mainly to address the Rohingya crisis.
The challenges facing the people of Myanmar have both deepened and expanded dramatically since., Six months ago, I took up this mandate as Myanmar continued to descend into profound and widespread conflict.
On top of one of the world’s largest refugee emergencies, I am tasked to help to address this multidimensional crises, with serious regional and international ramifications., Today, 14.4 million people, or one-quarter of the entire population of Myanmar urgently require humanitarian assistance., While conflict has plagued Myanmar’s border states for decades, the political crisis unleashed on 1 February 2021 has opened new frontlines that had long been at peace., More than half of the 700,000 people who have been internally displaced since the crisis began come from the central Bamar region. As of 26 May, there are now over one million IDPs across Myanmar., In the small ethnic state of Kayah, one-third of the population is currently displaced., In Rakhine, one of Myanmar’s poorest states, renewed tensions between the Tatmadaw and Arakan Army (AA) are fueling insecurity for all communities., In addition to almost one million Rohingya refugees in the camps in Bangladesh, and hundreds of thousands more across the region, more than 140,000 Rohingya people remain displaced and confined in IDP camps for the past 10 years in Rakhine., This crisis has resulted in collapsing state institutions, significantly disrupting critical social and economic infrastructures such as health, education, banking and finance, food security and employment, while increasing criminality and illicit activities. The people of Myanmar are facing intense suffering from this multidimensional crisis., The number of people living in poverty has doubled in the past five years to encompass half the population., Following the COVID-19 pandemic and political crisis, according to Save the Children, as of 1 June, school enrolment dropped by up to 80 per cent in the last two years, leaving at least 7.8 million children out of school., Through my direct contact with the people of Myanmar, I have learned the face of human tragedy behind these figures., People speak of families whose every possession was burned to ashes., Children have been held at gunpoint in a bid to capture their parents. Youth expressing selfless aspirations for a democratic Myanmar are in hiding, with parents unable to contact their children because of security concerns.
Ethnic and community leaders have told me about military attacks on civilian hideouts, as families flee, constantly seeking shelter but failing to find refuge., A generation that benefitted from the democratic transition is now disillusioned, facing chronic hardship and, tragically, many feel they have no choice left but to take up arms., Madame Vice-President,
Distinguished Delegates,, Armed conflict has now become the norm, and distrust among stakeholders has only deepened. In this zero-sum setting, there is a “missing middle” with little space to advocate for the de-escalation of violence or to engage in “talks about talks.” The military’s violence, including against peaceful protestors has only intensified since 1 February 2021.
The military continues its disproportionate use of force, has intensified its attack on civilians and increased operations against resistance forces, using aerial bombings. Civilian buildings and villages have been destroyed by fire and internally displaced populations have been attacked., Against this backdrop, armed resistance has proliferated., There are now reports of 600 armed resistance groups or “people’s defence forces” fighting against the Tatmadaw, some conducting assassinations targeting individuals deemed as “pro-military”., Nearly 14,000 people have been arrested and dozens have died in detention as spaces for civil society, freedom of expression and assembly, and other human rights have been suppressed., The Secretary-General has recently expressed alarm over the decision to execute pro-democracy activists., Madame Vice-President,
Distinguished Delegates,, In line with my all-stakeholder approach, I have engaged with hundreds of domestic stakeholders such as the National Unity Government (NUG), the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), the National League for Democracy (NLD), ethnic armed organizations, civil society, women and youth from communities, including in hard-to-reach areas., I have continued to engage and listen carefully to key stakeholders to understand their red lines and bottom lines for a durable exit strategy and to ensure an inclusive Myanmar-led process toward return to civilian rule, based on the will of the people. I hope to have the opportunity to similarly engage with the State Administration Council (SAC)., As part of their exit strategy in their Five-Point Road Map, the SAC has pledged to hold new elections in 2023., However, there is little confidence in a process administered by the military-appointed Union Election Commission., Without an inclusive political dialogue and conditions that permit citizens to freely exercise their political rights without fear or intimidation, this will further exacerbate violence and instability., The Commander-in-Chief has declared 2022 as “the year of peace” and invited ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) to hold peace talks. However, he has excluded key pro-democracy actors including the NUG and armed resistance groups, labeled as “terrorists.” None of the ethnic armed organizations who have joined the talks are parties to active fighting., Pro-democracy actors, in the meantime, have developed a “Federal Democratic Charter” to move toward a more inclusive democratic future, based on fundamental rights and inclusion of all., Without an inclusive multipronged approach and effective means to resolve the political crisis, escalating violence and collapsing state institutions, it is the people of Myanmar who continue to suffer., Recently, I visited the Thai border area where I engaged many local actors working on cross-border humanitarian assistance. Their message was the urgent need to build stronger and more equal partnership with local humanitarian networks, to ensure that aid reaches those in need without discrimination through greater access, stronger security measures and more localised and flexible funding., In an unpredictable context like Myanmar, flexible support is imperative including for protection. The multiple vulnerabilities facing affected communities requires safe and unimpeded access for the delivery of aid through all existing channels and without discrimination., My consultations with EAOs have also highlighted the need for the international community to be better aligned with ground realities. I have been informed that barriers to humanitarian support are the result of deliberate regime policies aimed at constraining the ability of communities to assist affected civilians in areas of active conflict., To fully and effectively respond to the suffering of the people, all existing governance structures need to be used including at the local level. Greater acknowledgement and support need to be given to the role of those ethnic administrations providing services to the populations under their control., We must put women at the center of all our efforts. Despite the violence, women have built tightly knit communities with great capacity for resilience. It is these structures that need more international support. Together with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, I will co-chair a Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Platform on Myanmar to support women community leaders as agents of change., We must amplify the voices of the most vulnerable and utilise the expertise of those on the ground, listen to them to understand the daily realities, and discuss how women and youth can play leading roles in bringing about positive change to their communities and country., Reflective of the unity forming across ethnic and democratic lines, key ethnic armed organizations and the NUG have also come together in an appeal for me to establish an inclusive platform for engagement and problem solving, focusing initially on the emergency humanitarian situation that is a direct result of the political crisis., They have asked me to work with “ASEAN Plus” to bring together all stakeholders including local organizations for discussions on humanitarian intervention based on the norms and principles of international humanitarian law and best practice., I will continue to play a bridging role and actively engage with key stakeholders in Myanmar, in the region, and the international community to address the protection needs and suffering of the most vulnerable, and to support the will of the people for a future federal democratic union based on peace, stability and shared prosperity., Madam Vice-President,
Distinguished Delegates,, The widening impact of the Myanmar crisis on regional peace and security has underlined the need to reinforce efforts to de-escalate hostilities., I continue to work closely with ASEAN, which has a crucial role in defusing this crisis., A year has passed since the adoption of ASEAN’s Five-Point Consensus calling for a cessation of violence, and constructive dialogue, including with all parties., Yet, continued differences, regionally and more broadly among UN Member States, have left the people of Myanmar feeling abandoned in their time of need., The General Assembly, the Security Council and ASEAN have all emphasized the importance of UN-ASEAN complementarity, most recently at the US-ASEAN Special Summit in May., I will continue my efforts to ensure complementarity as I bring insights and perspectives from on the ground into discussions. Despite technical issues raised by the SAC, I remain committed to exploring my first visit to Myanmar to engage., Madame Vice-President,
Distinguished Delegates,, Amid this complex crisis, the Rohingya must remain high on the agenda of the international community., I will continue to play a bridging role and actively engage with key stakeholders in Myanmar, in the region, and the international community to address the protection needs and suffering of the most vulnerable, and to support the will of the people for a future federal democratic union based on peace, stability and shared prosperity., Madam Vice-President,
Distinguished Delegates,, The widening impact of the Myanmar crisis on regional peace and security has underlined the need to reinforce efforts to de-escalate hostilities., I continue to work closely with ASEAN, which has a crucial role in defusing this crisis., A year has passed since the adoption of ASEAN’s Five-Point Consensus calling for a cessation of violence, and constructive dialogue, including with all parties., Yet, continued differences, regionally and more broadly among UN Member States, have left the people of Myanmar feeling abandoned in their time of need., The General Assembly, the Security Council and ASEAN have all emphasized the importance of UN-ASEAN complementarity, most recently at the US-ASEAN Special Summit in May., I will continue my efforts to ensure complementarity as I bring insights and perspectives from on the ground into discussions. Despite technical issues raised by the SAC, I remain committed to exploring my first visit to Myanmar to engage., Madame Vice-President,
Distinguished Delegates,, Amid this complex crisis, the Rohingya must remain high on the agenda of the international community., Throughout the region, the continued lack of legal status puts Rohingya at risk of arrest, prolonged detention and even, in some cases, deportation., In spite of these risks, Rohingya continue to take dangerous journeys for the hope of survival, family reunification and a better future. Most are exploited and subjected to more violence along their journeys and transnational criminal networks are preying on the vulnerability of the Rohingya community., While conditions in Myanmar are currently not conducive to the repatriation of Rohingya refugees, there are important steps that can be taken in Rakhine State itself to create the political, social and economic environment that will support sustainable return., Although the situation remains fragile, there has been a gradual improvement of intercommunal relationships and economic and social integration of Rohingya in Rakhine State. In these limited instances, communities stand to gain from social and economic interaction., Politically, too, there have been some positive signs. In a departure from negative rhetoric towards the Rohingya, AA has publicly committed to a peaceful state for all ethnic groups. The NUG has also recognized the Rohingya’s suffering and the importance of integrating their voices in the national dialogue., In spite of some reasons for cautious optimism, the situation on the ground remains grim. Local orders established after 1 February 2021 pose additional challenges for Rohingya travelling within townships in Rakhine State and in Myanmar, impeding livelihoods and access to healthcare and basic services., Deaths of children from acute diarrhea in Sittwe IDP camps and maternal deaths could have been avoided had there been unimpeded access to healthcare, as well as water, sanitation and hygiene services., Ultimately, better conditions for the Rohingya in Rakhine State and the sustainable repatriation of refugees from the region will not be possible until the key issues of citizenship, structural discrimination, security, civil registration, land ownership, political participation, freedom of movement, the right to family life and access to basic services are resolved., Thus, I call on the General Assembly to prioritise addressing root causes in Myanmar as the foundation for resolving the Myanmar crisis., Madame Vice-President,
Distinguished Delegates,, My work on durable solutions includes strengthening rights and services and supporting Rohingya in recovery and resilience through integrated and inclusive humanitarian, peace and development action. In this regard, it is essential we continue to be guided by the recommendations of the Rakhine Advisory Commission., Drawing on these and my extensive consultations, the workplan aims to improve the conditions in Rakhine State by supporting positive changes at both the vertical and horizontal levels., The vertical level involves key actors including the de-facto authorities, prodemocracy actors and the Arakan Army, among others., Against competing pressures and tensions, I have continued a multistakeholder approach by engaging with all vertical actors towards structural transformation., The horizontal level involves supporting grassroots initiatives that promote inclusivity, peaceful co-existence and equality for all., The people of Myanmar, including the Rohingya, know best the ground realities, and when and how to push boundaries effectively. The Rohingya I spoke to have made it clear they want to be engaged directly. They feel that their exclusion from discussions and decisions about their future has entrenched their marginalisation., They also want a recognition of their diversity and for their participation to be meaningful and broad-based, including women and youth., Madame Vice-President,
Distinguished Delegates,, It is ultimately Myanmar’s responsibility to address underlying issues., In August, we mark the fifth year since the beginning of the Rohingya crisis., In the absence of foreseeable solutions, the Rohingya crisis will remain a regional problem with the largest burden shouldered by the Government of Bangladesh and host communities., Under the leadership of the Government of Bangladesh, a comprehensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic for Rohingya refugees and affected host communities has prevented a catastrophe in the densely populated camps., My workplan will focus on strengthening partnerships and initiatives that can improve Rohingya access to protection, services and opportunities for empowerment, including the use of the Myanmar Women, Peace and Security Platform, that I initiated. This will include the women, peace and security platform that I have established and am co-chairing with the Foreign Minister of Indonesia., I will continue to advocate for greater leadership of countries in the region in supporting Bangladesh and leveraging their influence with Myanmar to create conducive conditions for the voluntary and dignified return of refugees., Meanwhile, regional countries could do more to demonstrate better treatment of Rohingya refugees., Desperate circumstances have continued to drive irregular movements by sea across the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea. In the first five months of this year alone, sixty-five people have died or gone missing., I welcome ASEAN’s continuing efforts to highlight the situation of the Rohingya and I encourage ASEAN to advocate to address the root causes and continue to work with all stakeholders to identify specific areas for ASEAN to support., Generations could be affected if we fail in our obligation to protect the people of Myanmar, their fundamental rights and dignity., As I discussed last week with Permanent Representatives of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation’s (OIC) Contact Group on the Rohingya Crisis, we need swift measures to prevent a lost generation, by providing Rohingya and others education opportunities, including abroad. I hope that these issues will be discussed during the upcoming Summit on Education., Madame Vice-President,
Distinguished Delegates,, From the tragedy of this conflict, new dynamics have emerged – an unprecedented solidarity among youth across all communities to reimagine Myanmar’s future democracy, human rights and governance., Inclusion of the Rohingya is a part of this new dynamic in ways we have not seen before. The wider political crisis has united people beyond ethnic and religious divides., I ask for your continued commitment, as the people in Myanmar are looking to the international community for support of their aspirations of a new Federal Democratic Union that resets Myanmar’s democracy, human rights and governance deficit, and realizes the strength in its diversity., Sustainable solutions for the Rohingya people must be built into the design of a peaceful, inclusive and democratic Myanmar., Despite emerging crises in the world, I know that this General Assembly will send a strong message that the aspiration of the people of Myanmar, including the Rohingya, will never be forgotten., Thank you.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/remarks-special-envoy-noeleen-heyzer-informal-meeting-general-assembly-myanmar-13-june-2022

Myanmar: UN experts sound alarm over junta’s decision to enforce death sentences,News and Press Release,UN HRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",10 Jun 2022,"GENEVA (10 June 2022) – The Myanmar junta’s announced decision to enforce death sentences against four individuals, including two prominent activists, marks the start of what could be a spate of death pronouncements, two UN experts* warned today, without an increase in international pressure on the brutal military regime., “The illegitimate military junta is providing the international community with further evidence of its disregard for human rights as it prepares to hang pro-democracy activists. These death sentences, handed down by an illegitimate court of an illegitimate junta, are a vile attempt at instilling fear amongst the people of Myanmar,” the experts said., In the face of increasing human rights violations, the experts urged the international community to exert greater pressure on Myanmar’s military., “Without imposing serious costs on the military for its attacks on fundamental rights, we should expect increasing numbers of these death penalty pronouncements from the junta,” they said. “The international community - chiefly Member States and the Security Council - must demonstrate that these actions will not go unpunished and do more to target the military’s needs for money, weapons and legitimacy.”, The experts stressed that one of the condemned individuals is a former member of parliament from the National League for Democracy, while another is a leader of the 88 Generation activist group that stood up to former dictator Ne Win’s regime. They were sentenced to death by a military tribunal in January 2022, on charges of treason and terrorism. If the executions proceed, they will be the first judicial executions in Myanmar since 1988., “The junta’s announced decision to execute the activists illustrates how the military seeks to use all apparatuses of the state to persecute those that oppose its attempt to return Myanmar to military authoritarian rule,” they said., The UN experts stressed that the imposition of the death penalty was taking place alongside the military’s extrajudicial killings of civilians, estimated now to stand at nearly 2,000., “The world must not lose sight of the fact that these death sentences are being meted out in the context of the military murdering civilians nearly every day in its widespread and systematic attack on the people of Myanmar. The military has killed civilians during massacres, crackdowns on protestors, and airstrikes against civilian locations, and has tortured detainees to death,” the experts said., The four individuals were tried and convicted in military tribunals, and reportedly without access to legal counsel during their rejected appeals - in violation of international human rights law., “In today’s Myanmar, fair trial and due process guarantees simply do not exist. The junta’s thumb is firmly upon the scales of justice and under these circumstances, imposing and enforcing the death penalty is especially heinous,” the experts said., Martial Law Order 3/2021, illegitimately decreed by the Myanmar junta in March 2021, provides for the application of the death penalty for 23 vague and broadly defined offences. Most notably, the order provides that the death penalty can be applied for treason provisions, which in practice means any criticism of the military., Since the military coup on 1 February 2021, at least 114 people have reportedly been sentenced to death, including 41 in absentia, Without recognising its legitimacy, the Special Rapporteurs called on the Myanmar junta to immediately and permanently halt the imposition of the death penalty and commute all capital sentences handed down to date., “Where capital punishment is not yet abolished, under no circumstances can the death penalty ever be applied as a sanction against the legitimate exercise of human rights, such as freedoms of opinion and expression, assembly and association,” the experts said. They reiterated that international law unequivocally forbids the imposition of the death penalty on anyone below 18 years of age., *The experts: Mr. Thomas Andrews, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar; Mr. Morris Tidball-Binz, Special Rapporteur on extra-judicial summary or arbitrary executions, The Special Rapporteurs, Independent Experts and Working Groups are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",9 Jun 2022,"This Analytical Brief focuses on the changing landscape of Myanmar in terms of climate, environmental degradation and disaster risk based on a review of recent research, hazard modelling and available data. It reviews the changing areas and populations at risk of exposure to natural disasters., Summary, Myanmar is one of the of the world’s most affected countries in terms of natural disasters, and among the most vulnerable to new disasters in the years to come. In addition to significant loss of life, livelihoods, and property, natural disasters are estimated to cost up to 3% of Myanmar’s annual GDP, and the longer-term impacts may be still greater., Changing climate and environmental degradation are influencing the frequency and severity of natural hazards in Myanmar, with predictions of more frequent and more severe floods, storms and droughts. Loss of natural ecosystems such as mangroves and forests, rising average annual temperatures, and more intense rainfall are all factors which could increase the impact of natural disasters on large numbers of Myanmar’s population., Extreme weather events do not become disasters on their own - the level of impact is influenced by the vulnerability of the affected community. Densely populated districts with less infrastructure investment were found to be key vulnerability hotspots. Populous coastal areas in Rakhine State and Ayeyarwady and Yangon Regions were found to be at risk of a wider variety of destructive events than other areas., Activities aimed at disaster risk reduction, disaster preparedness and response in Myanmar should carefully consider current as well as projected disaster risks. Further research and data collection are needed to develop effective approaches that can reduce the impact of climate change and environmental degradation on disaster risk for communities. More can also be done to create a shared understanding of vulnerability and how best it can be measured given limitations in available data.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/climate-environmental-degradation-and-disaster-risk-myanmar-mimu-analytical-brief-may-2022

Myanmar food security crisis: FAO and the Central Emergency Response Fund are enabling vulnerable farmers to feed themselves and their communities,News and Press Release,FAO,Agriculture,8 Jun 2022,"08/06/2022 Myanmar is facing a rapidly growing food security crisis where 13.2 million people are already food insecure. Ongoing violence, economic crisis, recurrent climate-induced shocks, population displacement and COVID-19, among other factors, are disrupting the entire national food system. Against this backdrop, protecting the livelihoods of smallholder farmers to enable them to produce their own food is a frontline humanitarian response., With the support of the Central Emergency Response Fund, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) provided emergency assistance to 4 700 vulnerable farming households across six townships in Mon State during April 2022. Each beneficiary, including landless and seasonal workers as well as femaleheaded households,received a cash grant of MMK 170 000 (USD 95) to meet their immediate foodneeds and other basic expenses. Along with the cash grant, FAO trained 1 759 households in Chaungzon townshipon good agricultural practices and provided them with fertilizers, vegetable seeds and a nutrition guide. Additionally, to mitigate the risk of COVID-19, FAO provided information materials, hygiene items and face masks to all the beneficiary households., Daw Tin Tin Win, 52 years old, is a landless farmerfrom Daukyet Village and was one of the beneficiaries of the response. Daw Tin Tin Win is the main breadwinner of her household and sher spouse is unable to work due to a life-threatening medical condition. Before receiving assistance from FAO, she used to sell vegetables —that she buys from wholesale producers—in the local market and earn a marginal profit to cover some of thedaily household needs. With the support that she received from FAO, she is now able to produce her own food, feed her family and generate a more reliable income., “Now, I am growing water spinach in my backyard, which is enabling me to earn more profit than before,thanks to the seeds and assistance that I have received from FAO” said Daw Tin Tin Win., U Ohn Myint, 65 years old, is smallholder farmer from Kalawt Kanai villageand one of the beneficiaries of the response. His village was not only impacted by severe floods and other climate-induced shocks, but also by an unprecedented economic turmoil. With the cash grant that he received, hebought medicines, a rice bag and cooking oil to address the immediate food needs of his family. In parallel, he was able to restore his livelihoods and a sense of hope., “With the vegetable seeds that I have received from FAO, I am growing pumpkins to reproduce seeds so that I can produceshoots and fruits in the upcoming season.” said U OhnMyint., FAO is continuing to scale-up its emergency response, aiming to assist more than 180 000 people in Kayah, Kayin, Chin, Mandalay, Ayeyarwaddy, Mon, Rakhine, Shan and Yangon in 2022. The response includes a range of interventions to supportcrop, livestock and vegetable production, along with the rehabilitation of vital irrigation infrastructure and the implementation of cash-based interventions. Every delay in protecting and restoring agricultural livelihoods means that the food security crisis in Myanmar will inevitably deteriorate further.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-food-security-crisis-fao-and-central-emergency-response-fund-are-enabling-vulnerable-farmers-feed-themselves-and-their-communities

Food and Nutrition
Health
Protection and Human Rights",8 Jun 2022,"Since the 2021 military coup, the security and human rights situation in Burma/Myanmar has seriously degraded, creating a dire humanitarian crisis that is being inadequately addressed. A large portion of the population in Southeast Burma is living in conflict-affected areas and enduring forced displacement, extreme food insecurity and constant threats to health and safety. Despite the high number of people fleeing to the Thai border seeking refuge, the vast majority have been unable to enter Thailand or seek protection under international conventions. Forced to remain within national borders, civilians are being subjected to threats to life by the State Administration Council (SAC) due to not only armed conflict, air strikes and other forms of violence, but also the deprivation of humanitarian aid., The current lack of access to aid is primarily due to deliberate attempts on the part of the SAC to deny lifesaving assistance to civilians in need, combined with barriers regarding the right of civilians to cross international borders to obtain protection – barriers that could constitute refoulement. Thus, it is clear that any true resolution to the current humanitarian crisis requires that the SAC and neighbouring governments respect their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights treaties and conventions. Such demands however continue to be ignored, which is why practical solutions to the existing situation must also be developed, and without further delay. With the primary channels for aid and protection provision largely out of play due to access issues, a better understanding of the situation on the ground is desperately needed in order to determine how new channels can be established that rely more fully on local actors already operating in these areas and how funding can be redirected to be more inclusive of these local actors., With that goal in mind, this report describes the situation on the ground in Karen State, looking both at the specific needs of villagers and communities, and at the efforts and challenges faced by organisations trying to assist and support them. This report examines the major logistical and security challenges preventing existing aid from effectively reaching its target recipients to help stakeholders better evaluate how aid can be used and implemented. The report also highlights how local efforts and initiatives are currently filling certain gaps, and how greater recognition of and investment in these channels may lead the way to more effective solutions not just in resolving immediate needs but also by supporting more sustainable mechanisms in the long run., Methodology, This report is based on 24 interviews conducted in November and December 2021, primarily with local leaders and villagers who are active in their community. In addition, six interviews were conducted with members of local CSO/CBOs about the work they have been undertaking since the coup and the challenges they have faced regarding emergency support and service delivery. Due to the outbreak of fighting and armed attacks since December 2021 in multiple districts, which then led to a deepening humanitarian crisis particularly along the Thai-Burma border area, raw data reports from December 2021 through March 2022 have also been included in the preparation of this report., The information is drawn from interviews and raw data gathered across only five of the seven districts within KHRG’s operational area: Doo Tha Htoo (Thaton), Kler Lwee Htoo (Nyaunglebin), Mergui-Tavoy, Mu Traw (Hpapun), and Dooplaya. The decision to limit our research to these areas was based on the type of documentation KHRG had been receiving since the coup, and what seemed to be the most critical areas in evaluating the challenges to humanitarian aid., Key Findings, Security risks and threats to life due to the escalation of armed conflict, air and ground attacks, retaliatory activities against civilians, arrests and roundups, and other human rights violations have led to increasing displacements of civilians since the 2021 military coup., The vast majority of displaced villagers in Southeast Burma remain internally displaced due to restrictions on the right to cross the border into Thailand, and thus are unable to benefit from wider international protections and humanitarian assistance., Reminiscent of the earlier “four cuts” approach employed by previous military regimes as a means to destroy the support base of ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) in Burma, the new military junta has imposed heavy restrictions on movement and the transportation of goods, confiscated, looted and destroyed medical and food supplies and arrested those providing them, thus cutting off essential resources to civilians., The SAC’s restrictions violate civilian rights under Article 3 of the Geneva Convention and the principle of humane treatment, which includes the obligation not to intentionally subject civilian populations to situations where their human dignity is threatened through lack of essential supplies., Reports of food shortages and of deaths due to the inability to access medical care, as well as decisions to remain in areas of heavy conflict and insecurity because there is nowhere else to go, all point to the gravity of the humanitarian crisis and the need for immediate action., The current efforts of villagers to support each other by drawing on local expertise to figure out alternative healthcare options, and to keep schools running for their children even in displacement show the effectiveness of local, community-driven networks in delivering aid to populations in need., Local civil society and community-based organisations (CSO/CBOs), ethnic service providers, and faith-based organisations, all of whom have knowledge of and experience with the local context, have been the primary actors providing humanitarian aid and emergency support to displaced villagers. International donors and humanitarian organisations, though unable to deliver the aid themselves, have failed to provide these groups with sufficient support., Overview of chapters, Chapter 1: Protection challenges, Over 170,000 people have been displaced in Karen State since the 2021 military coup., The Thai government has stated its commitment to assisting and taking care of people from Burma fleeing unrest who have crossed the border into Thailand. Meanwhile, villagers who crossed into Thailand have reported to KHRG that they were told by Thai soldiers, “Hey!!! No gunfire sound, you cannot come” and forced to return to Burma., Because of the difficulty of crossing into Thailand, semi-formal displacement sites on the Burma side of the Moei River are being created through the efforts of border-based CSO/CBOs, mostly Karen-led organisations, along with local faith-based organisations and the Karen National Union (KNU), who are coordinating activities to maximise impact and assure a minimum level of services to the IDPs who are finding refuge there., Although ‘formalised’ by local CSO/CBOs to provide better protection for the IDPs, these sites continue to struggle to exist in any official sense that might allow them to operate without obstruction from local governments and military personnel, and to access further funding., The total population at these semi-formal sites near and along the Moei River in Dooplaya District has risen from around 4,000 in January 2022 to around 11,400 as of the first week of April 2022, with the number of sites also increasing from five to eight., The vast majority of IDPs, however, have little to no access to humanitarian support, and are often unable to bring food, clothes, bedding, cooking equipment and other basic necessities with them. Spread out in nearby jungles, hiding in caves and along waterways, or taking refuge in other villages where they may have relatives, most of these IDPs remain invisible from an aid perspective., Concerned that supplies going to rural areas are intended for or will be given to ethnic armed groups, the SAC military has been placing heavy restrictions on the movement of goods, including humanitarian support. Thus, not only has it proven difficult to transport emergency relief support from Thailand, any movement of goods within Burma itself is being heavily monitored and restricted. These restrictions on the movement of goods are impacting not only the delivery of humanitarian support to displaced villagers, but also the livelihood and health needs of all rural villagers., Chapter 2: Livelihoods, Whether they have fled or not, villagers are struggling to meet their livelihood needs, with many running out of food and other necessities, yet also unable to access humanitarian support., Since the 2021 military coup, fighting and air and ground attacks by SAC forces as well as increased military activity, including security checkpoints, patrolling and heavy troop movements, have forced many villagers to flee their homes. Villagers often flee with little food and supplies, and have poor access to shelter and potable water., Villagers experiencing displacement are also at high risk of having their homes and villages looted and destroyed by SAC soldiers while they are displaced., Movement restrictions have resulted in livelihood challenges, insufficient food and higher purchase costs in the community – prices this year are three times higher than the previous year., “I think everybody faces food insecurity because we cannot work on anything as we cannot travel. […] Villagers just eat food that they keep [have stored away]. They bought that food before the road closed last year. […] Once that food is gone, they don’t know what they are going to do. […] Some villagers’ food [supply] is already gone.” -- A villager from Ma Htaw village tract, Dwe Lo Township, Mu Traw District, Since the coup, villagers in conflict-affected areas have often been unable to harvest crops and take care of their livestock due to fighting and shelling, SAC activities and landmine contamination. KHRG has received a number of reports of villagers being shot at and/or killed while working on their plantations since the start of the coup., Villagers have to undergo questioning by SAC soldiers whenever they transport any supplies, including food. After they are questioned by the SAC, their supplies are often confiscated and/or destroyed, and they have also had to pay fines to the SAC soldiers., Travel restrictions and high security risks after the coup stopped many organisations from working on community development and prevented humanitarian aid organisations from accessing communities that need help. Villagers and IDPs have been forced to rely on the limited assistance that local organisations, ethnic armed groups and community members themselves are able to provide. Even when IDPs receive humanitarian support, it still fails to meet the needs of most villagers., Chapter 3: Health care, Although the healthcare system has been in crisis throughout Burma since the 2021 military coup, the healthcare situation for villagers in rural ethnic areas is even more critical since support services have greatly curtailed across districts., The SAC has placed heavy restrictions on the transportation of medical supplies and increased the number of military checkpoints. Villagers reported having medicine and medical supplies systematically confiscated at security checkpoints near towns, and having to secretly transport supplies from towns back to their village., Health workers themselves have become significant targets of SAC attacks and have become less active in rural areas where health care is already limited. Displaced villagers have frequently stated that they have not received any healthcare support since being displaced, unless a health worker was among those who fled., Access to health care varies depending on the conditions of displacement, notably the displaced villagers’ ability to travel and the location of the IDP site. Some displaced villagers are able to access healthcare services offered by a network of locally-based border organisations inside the country and operating near the Thai-Burma border., In many cases, IDPs cannot travel out of the places they are displaced due to ongoing insecurity. Because they cannot access medical facilities, some villagers have died as a result., As many rural villages have been cut off from external aid following the coup, many villagers have been supporting one another on a local level to ensure that the village has sufficient health care. Without support and funding from other organisations, it is unlikely that villagers will be able to sustain healthcare support among themselves., Communities facing displacement have been particularly impacted by the third wave of COVID-19. The lack of testing in many areas has also meant that villagers are usually unaware of being infected prior to displacement, and thus unable to take necessary precautions. The spread of the virus has been exacerbated by the fact that few rural villagers have been vaccinated, and most rural villagers do not trust the SAC to administer vaccinations to them., Since the coup, women have been facing challenges gaining access to sufficient maternal health care. Pregnant women experiencing displacement are at significant risk of suffering complications during childbirth, yet there is a lack of healthcare workers equipped to help with pregnancy issues and childbirth at displacement sites., The elderly and disabled are often those who are unable to displace despite the insecurity of staying in the village. Those who do displace are likely to endure living conditions that are particularly harsh and unsuitable for these more vulnerable populations, and are also more likely to suffer increased health problems as a result., Chapter 4: Education, Despite the challenging circumstances, villagers are taking great effort to make sure that the children in their communities are able to continue their studies., KHRG received multiple reports that enrolments at Karen Education and Culture Department (KECD) schools have increased due to government school closures and students refusing to attend SAC-run schools. In some cases, SAC and Border Guard Force (BGF) soldiers have also threatened teachers, parents and students to try to force them to return to SAC-run schools, only making villagers more concerned about sending their children to these schools., But increased enrolments have placed heavy strain on the schools’ resources. Many schools reported not having enough teachers for the number of students, not having sufficient supplies and classroom space, and not having the appropriate resources to add additional grades., Communities have also turned to creating self-funded schools in an effort to meet the educational needs of the children in their community., Although villagers have been able to help each other thus far in order to keep schools running, if the situation continues, communities will have fewer resources. Already, external support has dwindled., Villagers and communities facing displacement have encountered the biggest challenges maintaining educational services for their children., In some areas, villagers reported that schools have been closed for two years now., Social assistance programmes to protect education and keep schools open in situations of insecurity and armed conflict rarely exist, but need to be developed in order to prevent the further marginalisation and denial of rights of ethnic minorities., Chapter 5: Local actors and the need for funding alternatives, Only 0.2 % of incoming funds allocated to NGOs (and only 0.069% of total incoming funds) were distributed to local NGOs. --United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Financial Tracking Service, 2016 data for Burma, Since the coup, some foreign governments and stakeholders, in an effort to avoid working with the SAC and show their non-recognition of the SAC as a legitimate government, have tried to redirect funds to organisations like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and other international partners. However, these efforts often fail to address the problem of directing funding elsewhere since the SAC can often still dictate the terms., As such, there are few existing channels that allow funding to make its way directly to local service providers and protection agents, despite the fact that under the current situation these are the primary actors providing emergency support. Without sufficient funding, their ability to continue providing support will remain highly limited. Already stretched thin, support for those in need will only become tighter as the population of displaced persons grows., Conclusion, Local service providers and local communities themselves have been instrumental in responding to the needs of rural villagers as the humanitarian crisis deepens. Meanwhile, most external NGOs and large international organisations have been prevented from undertaking protection services and offering humanitarian support, whether in Burma or across the border in Thailand., There continues to be a failure to recognise the true contributions being made by local actors and the ways in which protection frameworks and funding schemes are set up to exclude local actors from larger decision-making about how aid distribution should and could function., Donors and international humanitarian organisations currently face a crucial choice between sticking to orthodox humanitarian practices and principles that ultimately reinforce the military junta’s ability to weaponise humanitarian aid and further oppress ethnic populations, or engaging meaningfully with those CSOs and CBOs on the ground that are fully capable of providing aid to the communities they serve., Donor funding must not sideline ethnic communities from key decisions or through bureaucratic obstacles but be equal partners in aid programs and services., Recommendations, To the international community, ASEAN, NGOs, funding agencies, and regional and foreign governments, Acknowledge that the SAC is the root cause of the current human rights and humanitarian crisis., Refrain from giving any political legitimacy to the military junta and recognise that any collaboration with the junta only serves to bolster their legitimacy., Ensure that the SAC is unable to hold decision-making power over the distribution of aid, and that funds are not indirectly being rerouted through the SAC., Recognise that the humanitarian principle of neutrality is frequently misapplied in the case of Burma, and thus often impedes the fulfilment of the wider humanitarian agenda., Consult and sign MoUs with the National Unity Government (NUG) and EAOs, rather than the SAC, to address the unfolding humanitarian crisis across the country., Call on ASEAN to suspend Burma from ASEAN membership until a democratically-elected civilian government is restored, and to cooperate with international and local actors to end the military junta’s violence against the people of Burma., Diversify international funding distribution so that more funding is made directly available to non-state actors, particularly ethnic service providers and civil society organisations, regardless of their registration status., Prioritise and strengthen methods of service delivery and communication that rely on local CSO/CBOs and ethnic service providers that have the ability and networks (due to consistent access and trust from the community) for local implementation of support programmes., Support ethnic health organisations (EHOs) and other non-state health actors, including the COVID-19 Task Force created by the NUG and local EHOs, to boost COVID-19 prevention and treatment, and ensure the provision of other essential health services in rural areas., Support self-funded and ethnic-run schools and education programmes by directing funding to local service providers and CSO/CBOs., Urge neighbouring countries to ensure that their authorities do not deny entry to people crossing the border seeking refuge; and encourage them to work with cross border organisations to develop support and protection services for those seeking refuge., Engage with neighbouring countries to ensure the passage of aid into Burma, in particular via land borders and through cross border aid organizations and local civil society organizations already operating in the area., Publicly declare support for an International Criminal Court (ICC) referral and seek out all additional opportunities to hold the Burma military accountable for its vast array of crimes., Place sanctions on oil and gas revenues, and impose other measures that will have an economic impact on the junta’s ability to wage war against the people of Burma., Support a UN Security Council resolution on a global arms embargo., Assist in the creation of civilian safe zones (both in Burma and in neighbouring countries) where the protection of civilians is internationally guaranteed.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/denied-and-deprived-local-communities-confronting-humanitarian-crisis-and-protection-challenges-southeast-burma-enmyth
Myanmar: UN experts condemn military’s “digital dictatorship”,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,7 Jun 2022,"GENEVA (7 June 2022) – UN human rights experts* today condemned the Myanmar military junta’s attempts to establish a “digital dictatorship” in Myanmar by imposing further restrictions on the access to internet, internet shutdowns, online censorship, surveillance and other barriers to internet access., “The international community must not stand quietly by while the people of Myanmar are systematically denied their fundamental rights to freedom of expression, access to information and privacy, which are guaranteed by international human rights law,” said the experts., “Online access to information is a matter of life and death for many people in Myanmar, including those seeking safety from indiscriminate attacks by the military and the millions trying to navigate a devastating economic and humanitarian crisis. The junta is using internet shutdowns and invasive surveillance to undermine widespread public opposition and prop up its attacks on the people of Myanmar.”, The experts urged UN Member States to condemn the junta’s policies to curtail fundamental freedoms on and off-line, and to adopt targeted sanctions against the military and military-linked companies, including sanctions restricting the sale or supply of dual-use surveillance technology. They also urged UN Member States and international donors to support civil society initiatives to counter censorship and surveillance in Myanmar., Following the 1 February 2021 military coup in Myanmar, the junta imposed rolling nationwide internet blackouts and blocked access to social media and messaging platforms. More recently, the junta has imposed targeted internet shutdowns in areas where it faces strong resistance from opposition groups. Since August 2021, 31 townships in seven states and regions have reportedly experienced internet shutdowns, with a further 23 townships experiencing the throttling of internet speeds. The imposition of internet shutdowns and throttling on many townships in Sagaing Region in early March coincided with the launch of a major military offensive and campaign of violence and arson against the civilian population in the area., “Internet restrictions are being used by the junta as a cloak to hide its ongoing atrocities,” said the experts. “The barriers to internet access impede efforts by journalists, human rights monitors and humanitarian organizations to collect evidence of human rights violations committed by the military or serve at risk populations.”, “The lack of connectivity in large parts of the country also poses a challenge to our mandates, which depend on the collection of contemporaneous evidence of human rights abuses.”, The junta continues to block access to websites and social media platforms, including Facebook, a primary channel for communication and sharing information in Myanmar. It has forced internet service providers to increase data prices and has imposed new taxes on data and SIM cards, making internet access unaffordable for many. Three out of four telecommunications companies operating in Myanmar have direct links to the military following the Norwegian telecommunications company Telenor’s sale of its Myanmar operations in March. Telecommunications providers have come under heavy pressure to activate surveillance technology and hand over user data to police and military officials., Two weeks after the coup, an amendment to the Electronic Transactions Law expanded access to personal data by government agencies and law enforcement personnel and created new, broadly defined crimes relating to online speech. A draft Cybersecurity Law would further empower authorities to block online content or restrict internet access without judicial oversight and would ban the use of virtual private networks (VPNs), with VPN users facing up to three years’ imprisonment. Although the law has not yet been enacted, police and military officials have already begun looking for VPN applications when searching the phones of suspected opposition members and other detainees., “The people of Myanmar need and deserve a strong international response to the junta’s assault on freedom of expression and access to information and violations of the right to privacy, which threaten the lives and wellbeing of millions. Member States must act swiftly to curtail the junta’s efforts to drag Myanmar back to a digital dark age.”, ENDS, *The experts: Mr. Thomas Andrews, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar; Ms. Irene Khan, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of freedom of opinion and expression; Dr. Ana Brian Nougrères, Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy; and Mr. Clément Nyaletsossi Voule, Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, The Special Rapporteurs, Independent Experts and Working Groups are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.

Myanmar: Junta vows to enforce death sentences,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,7 Jun 2022,"Free All Wrongfully Imprisoned; End Capital Punishment, (New York) – Myanmar’s military junta announced on June 3, 2022, that it would execute four people whose appeals were rejected following grossly unjust closed-door trials, Human Rights Watch said today. The activist Kyaw Min Yu, known as “Ko Jimmy,” and the opposition lawmaker Phyo Zeya Thaw were sentenced to death on January 21 by a military tribunal under Myanmar’s overbroad Counterterrorism Law of 2014., Military tribunals in Myanmar have sentenced 114 people to death since the February 2021 military coup, including 41 in absentia. The United Nations (UN), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and concerned governments should press the junta to immediately release all those wrongfully imprisoned, including Phyo Zeya Thaw and Ko Jimmy, and commute all death sentences., “Myanmar military courts’ disregard of basic rights was evident in the farcical trials and death sentences of Phyo Zeya Thaw and Ko Jimmy,” said Manny Maung, Myanmar researcher at Human Rights Watch. “These secretive tribunals with their lightning convictions are aimed at chilling any dissent against the military junta.”, On October 24, 2021, soldiers arrested Ko Jimmy, 52, in Yangon’s North Dagon township. The authorities had issued a warrant for his arrest on February 13, 2021, for allegedly inciting unrest and taking part in “terrorism”, both offenses under the Counterterrorism Law. The soldiers severely beat Ko Jimmy during his arrest and tortured him in custody, his family said., On November 18, soldiers and police arrested Phyo Zeya Thaw, 41, during a raid on a housing complex in Yangon’s Dagon Seikkan township. A military court charged the former National League for Democracy legislator and hip-hop artist under the Counterterrorism Law and the Public Property Protection Act with leading deadly shootings on pro-military targets., A junta spokesperson, Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, announced that the two men would be “hanged according to prison procedures,” but said that no date had been set for the executions. Two other men, Hla Myo Aung and Aung Thura Zaw, who were convicted for killing an alleged military informant, would also be hanged, the spokesperson said. The military has not revealed where Phyo Zeya Thaw and Ko Jimmy are, and the men have not been seen since their arrests, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners., Phyo Zeya Thaw and Ko Jimmy were arrested in townships in which the junta has declared martial law. In imposing martial law, the junta transferred all executive and judicial authority to the head of the relevant regional military command, and instituted the death penalty as a possible sentence for 23 crimes, the majority of which are not capital crimes in civilian courts., Military tribunals have issued death sentences against defendants in rushed and closed legal proceedings, depriving those charged of their basic fair trial rights. Those on trial before military tribunals face almost certain conviction regardless of the available evidence against them. There is no scrutiny of the trials by the public or the international community. Myanmar security forces have subjected many people arrested since the coup to torture and other ill-treatment, including frequent beatings., In May 2021, the junta formally designated the opposition National Unity Government, its parliamentary committee, and their offshoot militias as “terrorist groups” for alleged acts of incitement against the junta, seemingly to justify broad suppression and to criminalize any support for activities opposing the coup. In August 2021, the chairman of the State Administration Council junta, Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, amended the Counterterrorism Law to introduce harsher penalties for anti-coup activities that do not distinguish between acts of violence and peaceful protest, shifting the burden of proof to the accused., Martial law regulations require the State Administration Council chair to approve all execution orders. They also state there is “no appeal for decisions or convictions handed down” by a military tribunal. The only option for defendants sentenced to death is to apply to the junta chair within 15 days of the conviction to reverse the decision or to reduce the sentence. The applications can only be filed through prison officials, not lawyers, Radio Free Asia reported. A source who is familiar with Phyo Zeya Thaw and Ko Jimmy’s cases said the families were unaware of the appeal efforts until the junta’s statement to the media., The UN spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, said he was “deeply troubled” by the military’s decision to proceed with the executions of political dissidents. “This is a blatant violation of the right to life, liberty, and security of person as per Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” he said., Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances and has long called on Myanmar to ban all capital punishment. Capital punishment is unique in its cruelty and finality, and is universally plagued with arbitrariness, prejudice, and error., Since the February 2021 coup, junta security forces have carried out mass killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and indiscriminate attacks on civilians that amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes. The security forces have killed over 1,800 people, including at least 130 children, and arbitrarily arrested over 13,000., Australia, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and other countries that have banned capital punishment, as well as ASEAN member states, should call for the release of all those wrongfully detained and the commutation of death sentences. All concerned governments should agree on a stronger, coordinated effort to impose or enhance targeted sanctions against senior military officials including by increasing restrictions on Myanmar’s foreign currency revenues., “The junta’s threats to execute Ko Jimmy and Phyo Zeya Thaw after sham military trials should be dropped immediately,” Maung said. “Concerned governments should use concerted levers of pressure to stop these executions, and be crystal clear that executing people after unfair trials will have consequences.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-junta-vows-enforce-death-sentences

Protection and Human Rights",6 Jun 2022,"ABSTRACT, The first round of the Myanmar Household Welfare Survey (MHWS), a nationally and regionally representative phone survey, was implemented between December 2021 and February 2022 with 12,100 households. This report discusses its findings related to shocks, livelihoods, coping strategies and food security. We find that almost 1 in 5 households experience physical insecurity, more than 1 in 10 were negatively affected by climatic shocks, and 3 in 5 experienced sickness or death of household members in the past three months. Two thirds of households reported a lower income in the beginning of 2022 compared to 12 months earlier, indicating widespread impacts of the pandemic, the political crisis, and the ensuing economic crisis. Ninety percent of households applied at least one coping strategy to deal with lack of food or money during the past month. More than half of all households lowered food and non-food expenditures. A large number of households also used more dramatic coping strategies, including high-risk income generating activities (4 percent), children working (3 percent of households), migration (1 percent), or selling of the dwelling or land (1 percent). Even though data were collected in the beginning of 2022 after the monsoon harvest and thus a relatively favorable time of the year for food security, still 9 percent of the households did not have an adequate food consumption pattern and 4 percent suffered from moderate or severe hunger. Violent events in the township, self-reported physical insecurity, climatic and health shocks all are strongly associated with negative outcomes for income, coping and food security. Chin and Kayah state experienced high levels of violence and consistently perform worse across the range of welfare indicators considered.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/welfare-and-vulnerability-findings-first-round-myanmar-household-welfare-survey-strategy-support-program-working-paper-18-june-2022

Food and Nutrition",6 Jun 2022,"ABSTRACT, We analyze rice input and productivity data for the monsoon seasons of 2020 and 2021 from the Myanmar Agriculture Performance Survey (MAPS). The survey covers plots of 2,672 rice producers, spread over 259 townships in all states/regions of the country. We find that:, Rice productivity at the national level during the monsoon of 2021 decreased on average by 2.1 percent compared to the monsoon of 2020. Considering estimated area reductions, national paddy production decreased by 3.4 percent compared to the monsoon of 2020., Some areas performed substantially worse. Rice yields were low and declined significantly in Kayah and Chin, two conflict-affected states that have shown the highest levels of food insecurity in recent assessments., Prices for most inputs used in rice cultivation increased significantly between these two seasons. Prices of urea, the most important chemical fertilizer used by rice farmers, increased by 56 percent on average and mechanization costs increased by 19 percent., Paddy prices at the farm increased by 8 percent, significantly less than input prices, squeezing rice farmers’ profits during the monsoon of 2021., Despite the substantial hurdles in production and marketing due to the political crisis and international market developments, the results of the Myanmar Agricultural Performance Survey show the overall resilience of rice production during the monsoon of 2021. While the rice sector has been a source of stability in the country, the situation for future crop seasons is however concerning given further increases in input prices (especially fertilizer), the overall reduced profitability of rice farming, the reduced coping strategies remaining for rice farmers, and currency policy changes by the military government.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/rice-productivity-myanmar-assessment-2021-monsoon-and-outlook-2022-strategy-support-program-working-paper-19-may-2022

Ongoing armed clashes have been reported in multiple townships in Chin State, Sagaing and Magway regions with fighting between the Myanmar Armed Forces and various People’s Defence Forces (PDFs). The fighting has led to further displacement of civilians, destruction of property, and challenges in the transportation of people and goods, including humanitarian assistance, into the northwest.
Despite the dire humanitarian situation in the northwest, humanitarian access in the northwest remains very limited.
There are now 426,200 people who remain displaced in the northwest because of conflict and insecurity since February 2021., The total number of people internally displaced inside Myanmar has passed one million according to UN figures as of 30 May. This includes 691,000 internally displaced people displaced by conflict and insecurity since the 2021 military takeover and 346,600 people who remain displaced from previous conflicts, the majority of whom are in Rakhine State., PHILIPPINES, The Mount Bulusan volcano in Sorsogon Province, erupted on 5 June with a phreatic eruption lasting 17 minutes generating plumes of volcanic ash reaching 1.5 km in altitude and with ashfalls in the municipalities of Juban, Casiguran and Irosin.

Sagaing Region in particular has seen a rapid increase in the number of displaced people.
In the South-East, intensified armed clashes continued with incidents reported in Kayin, Mon, Kayah, and Shan (South) States and Bago-East and Tanintharyi regions. Populations affected by conflict find themselves unable to seek safety and services with many displaced in jungles or hard to reach areas. Reports of arrests, casualties, and destruction/looting of property continue as well as movement restrictions due to security checks and roadblocks.
In Kachin and Shan (North), tensions mounted in key contested areas with conflict erupting in existing and new areas. Affected communities express concern about escalating conflict as IDPs limit their movement to avoid possible arrest and mistreatment in militarized areas.
Movement restrictions continue impacting access to basic services and livelihood opportunities of IDPs. In Shan (North), forced recruitment – including of children - continued being reported.
IDPs have sought solutions where opportunities presented themselves but face the risk of landmines and require support to rebuild homes and access healthcare, education and livelihoods.
In Rakhine State, tensions have increased, and fear of resumption of the conflict, restrictions on freedom of movement and extortion (when travelling or accessing services) impact all communities – especially the Rohingya population. There are also concerns that with a possible resumption of the conflict, specific communities could be targeted for their perceived or imputed association with different parties to the conflict.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-emergency-update-1-june-2022

Logistics and Telecommunications
Protection and Human Rights",6 Jun 2022,"Key Facts, WFP has assisted more than 2 million people in Myanmar during the first quarter of 2022, with plans to assist at least 4 million by the end of the year., Those assisted mainly include people newly displaced by conflict, people living in prolonged displacement, and poor urban dwellers – mostly women and children – whose livelihoods and food security status have been affected by the economic crisis., WFP continues to seek humanitarian access to tens of thousands of displaced and vulnerable populations in active conflict zones who are in urgent need of emergency food and nutrition assistance., Funding Requirements, WFP requires USD 66.8 million between June to December 2022 to ensure uninterrupted support to its beneficiaries. Of the required amount, USD 43.8 million (66 percent) is for life-saving food assistance. Funding for urban operations is expected to run out in August, while cash-based operations in crisis-affected areas will face interruptions in September 2022, affecting IDPs and other vulnerable people., Situation Update, Escalating conflict and displacement: Clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and various armed groups have continued to escalate in 2022, especially in the north-west and the south-east regions of the country.
Civilians continue to bear the brunt of these conflicts, with 240,000 displaced during the first quarter of the year. The total number of IDPs – both pre- and post-military takeover – in Myanmar now stands at more than 1 million (UNHCR). The security and humanitarian situation remains tense in many areas, with active conflict – including airstrikes, artillery fire, ambushes, and raids – a daily threat for many civilians. Extended periods of conflict in some areas have cut ties between civilians and their homes, and their sources of livelihoods: many farmers have not planted or harvested crops, while seasonal workers have been unable to secure crucial casual employment., Rising food and fuel prices: Fuel prices increased 18 percent between February and March this year, driven by global uncertainty, the conflict in Ukraine, and local conditions. At the end of March, fuel prices in Myanmar were more than double those registered in February 2021 (+133 percent), according to WFP’s March Market Price update., The increase in fuel prices has caused transport costs to rise – a key driver of increasing retail food prices. The cost of a basic food basket increased by 10 percent from February to March, and the highest month-on-month increases were recorded in northern Rakhine State (+29%) and Kayah State (+26%). Compared to the same time last year, the average cost of a basic food basket is up 32 percent., Edible oil prices rose by 23 percent between February and March, mostly due to high transport costs and volatility in local exchange rates. The average price of rice increased 7 percent from February to March with rising prices felt nearly everywhere in the country. Rising fertilizer prices could drive food prices higher still. While Myanmar mainly imports fertilizer from China, the conflict in Ukraine is expected to have knock-on effects on the availability and price of fertilizer in Myanmar., Access challenges: Humanitarian access to newly displaced populations, mainly in active conflict zones, remains largely restricted, limiting WFP’s ability to reach populations in urgent need of food assistance. The lengthy process required to secure travel authorizations for WFP’s monthly distributions remains a challenge. Travel authorizations are often granted on a tight schedule, allowing only limited periods to distribute humanitarian assistance., WFP continues to plan well in advance to ensure travel authorizations are granted in time for distributions to proceed on schedule, as the security situation allows., Meeting humanitarian needs: The conflict in Ukraine, coupled with the protracted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, is exerting a negative impact on food prices, lead times and supplier capacity. In Myanmar, these issues are exacerbated by conflict within the country., Many displaced farmers have been unable to harvest and sow crops since October of 2021. If this continues, the sowing of paddy rice will also be affected in many areas. The cumulative effect is likely to be a reduction in farmers’ income and food stock, which could result in a rice shortage in the market and even higher prices., WFP will continue to use its monthly market updates to monitor the costs of food and fuel, and work with field offices and partners to identify potential activity adaptations, such as coordinating ahead of time with banks to ensure funds are available for cash-based transfers, adjusting transport contracts, and increasing the value of cash-based transfers to meet the basic needs of beneficiaries. WFP also continues to allow more lead time for the procurement of food and nutrition rations., A potential risk is that WFP will need to pay more to procure commodities from international markets, which would require additional funding or reducing relief assistance coverage.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/wfp-myanmar-situation-report-may-2022
"Hpa-an District Short Update: SAC military activity frightens local civilians and raises fears of forced portering, April to May 2022",Situation Report,KHRG,Protection and Human Rights,2 Jun 2022,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in T’Nay Hsah Township, Hpa-an District during the period between April 20th and May 10th 2022. This report includes information about the State Administration Council (SAC) Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) #547, whose soldiers frightened villagers by firing guns into the sky and planted landmines around their army camp, which is located close to villages. The movement of BGF soldiers’ led to fear of forced portering among villagers in T’Nay Hsah Township.[1], State Administration Council (SAC)[2] soldiers frightened villagers, During the night of April 20th 2022, soldiers from SAC Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[3] #547 in T’Nay Cha army camp fired guns into the sky when they saw a light from villagers [who live around the army camp], who were hunting crickets. T’Nay Cha army camp is located in T’Nay Hsah village, T’Nay Hsah Township, Hpa-an District. When the SAC fired guns, villagers were in fear whilst they were in their beds and were highly concerned that fighting was going to take place in the community. One of the villagers who lives close to the incident place expressed that, “It happened when we were sleeping. We worried that the fighting would break out and [we] ran immediately to the bunker. Similarly, the other families also ran in fear and some of them could not bring their children with them in fear.” Villagers assumed that the SAC fired guns in order to frighten the villagers who were hunting crickets. A lot of villagers that live around the army camp do not feel secure going out at night to hunt and villagers informed other villagers to not go out and hunt at night, due to safety concerns. As the incident happened during insect hunting season, many villagers are still going out at night to hunt insects for their families., On April 19th 2022, the day before the incident, SAC soldiers told the heads of the villages that are located near the army camp, such as Ler Poo, Noh Hta Baw, Noh Kaw Tay, T’Nay Hsa, T’Weh Dah and other villages, that villagers should not go close to the army camp because they [the SAC] would plant landmines around their army camp. The SAC did not provide the villagers with a reason for planting the landmines. They allowed villagers to travel on the road beside the army camp. The army camp is close to the villages, so villagers’ livestock always travel around the army base for food and villagers go looking for their livestock every afternoon. Therefore, both villagers and their livestock are at high risk of [stepping on] landmines in the community. However, villagers are not sure whether the SAC actually planted the landmines, because they have not seen a signpost [that warns villagers] of the landmine contamination., Local civilians fear forced portering by the Border Guard Force (BGF)[4], On the morning of May 10th 2022, a large number of BGF soldiers [consisting of multiple troops] travelled from Doo Tha Htoo (Toungoo) or Mu Traw (Hpapun) District [it is unknown which district] into T’Nay Hsah Township, Hpa-an District. Villagers in T’Nay Hsah Township received information [from the news] about the BGF arresting villagers to be forced porters [in other districts like Doo Tha Htoo District[5]]. Therefore, local villagers became increasingly concerned that they were going to become forced porters for the BGF. Male villagers who live close to the vehicle road fled from their villages to escape, when they saw a large number of BGF soldiers travelling along public roads in Htoe Kaw Koe village tract[6], T’Nay Hsah Township. [Male villagers are more likely to be arrested to become forced porters.], Further background reading on the security situation in Hpa-an District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in May 2022.

1st 2021 military coup. It was established by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on February 2nd 2021, and is composed of eight military officers and eight civilians. The chairperson serves as the de facto head of government of Burma/Myanmar and leads the Military Cabinet of Myanmar, the executive branch of the government. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of SAC chairperson following the coup., [3] A Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) comprises 500 soldiers. Most Light Infantry Battalions in the Tatmadaw are under-strength with less than 200 soldiers, yet up-to-date information regarding the size of battalions is hard to come by, particularly following the signing of the NCA. LIBs are primarily used for offensive operations, but they are
sometimes used for garrison duties., [4] Border Guard Force (BGF) battalions of the Tatmadaw were established in 2010, and they are composed mostly of soldiers from former non-state armed groups, such as older constellations of the DKBA, which have formalised ceasefire agreements with the Burma/Myanmar government and agreed to transform into battalions within the
Tatmadaw., [5] See KHRG, “Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: Forced portering and the use of civilians as human shields by the SAC and BGF in Bilin Township (September 2021)”, March 2022., [6] A village tract is an administrative unit of between five and 20 villages in a local area, often centred on a large

"Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: SAC troops arbitrarily detain seven villagers, March 2022",Situation Report,KHRG,Protection and Human Rights,1 Jun 2022,"This Short Update describes events that occurred in Tha Htoo (Thaton) Township, Doo Tha Htoo (Thaton) District in April 2022. On April 1st 2022, at about 9:30 am, State Administration Council (SAC) troops arrested seven villagers they accused of supporting resistance fighters, beating another villager in the process. On April 5th 2022, six of the arrested villagers were released after a local leader bribed their captors. However, they were forced to flee to Thailand because of death threats by the SAC soldiers. The seventh villager was not released until the first week of May 2022.[1], On March 29th and 31st 2022, Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[2] and People’s Defence Force (PDF)[3] fighters ambushed State Administration Council (SAC)[4] troops from an unidentified artillery unit near H--- pond, L--- village, Sway Yaw Pya village tract[5], Tha Htoo (Thaton) Township. On April 1st 2022, at about 8:00 am, SAC troops in two military trucks arrived at the scene, set up hidden observation posts, and also patrolled the vicinity of L--- village., Saw G---, a 22-year-old villager from A--- village, Shwe Yaw Pya village tract, was in a nearby field with his parents, his cousin, and two of his friends. A villager from L--- village phoned his mother and informed her that the SAC troops were heading their way. However, the soldiers surrounded them before they could leave. The SAC soldiers asked them about the KNLA and PDF ambushes. They told the villagers that they must know the people who attacked them, since they live in this area. They also accused them of sheltering and helping PDF fighters in the village., The SAC troops briefly detained the villagers and made them lay on the ground, facedown. When Saw G--- told them that he did not know anything about [the ambushes], the SAC battalion commander hit his head three times with the grip of his pistol, causing him a minor injury. The SAC troops also threatened to burn down A--- village if the PDF attacks them again. There were about 12 to 13 SAC soldiers at the scene, and even more in the areas surrounding the field., The SAC soldiers eventually arrested and took away Saw G---’s cousin and his friend. They then resumed patrolling the area, arresting four other villagers they found fishing at H---pond, as well as another villager named Saw O--- [who was reportedly drunk at the time, and is possibly suffering from mental health issues]. Saw G---’s cousin lives in T--- village, and the other arrested villagers live in A--- village, Shwe Yaw Pya village tract, K---village, Moe Kaung village tract, and I--- village, Don Won village tract. The SAC troops took the seven villagers away [on accusations of supporting the PDF], and confiscated three of their motorcycles., The arrested villagers were:, When Saw G--- arrived at his village with his parents, he informed the village tract administrator about the incident and told him that the SAC soldiers had asked for a two million kyats ransom per detained villager. However, the SAC troops did not disclose where the villagers would be taken. Family members went looking for their arrested relatives at Artillery Unit #9’s camp, but could not find them there. They suspected that the villagers might have been taken to Artillery Unit #3. The location of the arrested civilians remained unknown [presumably for several hours], and [the] soldiers [who arrested the villagers] did not communicate further with the detainees’ family members., Later that day, the family members learned that the villagers had been arrested by the SAC artillery unit which is based at Wa Pa (Win Pa) army camp, Kyeik Kaw in Tha Htoo Town. On April 5th 2022, six of the arrested villagers were released with the help of a local leader [who paid an unknown amount to the SAC soldiers]. Only Saw O--- remained in custody because no one dared to ask for his release. Before they were freed, the SAC troops warned that they did not want to see the six villagers in their villages anymore, saying that they would kill them if they did. The threat prompted the released villagers to flee to Thailand out of fear. Saw O--- was eventually released from custody in the first week of May 2022. The SAC soldiers said that he was no longer of use to them and so released him., Further background reading on the human rights and security situation in Doo Tha Htoo District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in March 2022.

ACLED Regional Overview - East Asia Pacific (21-27 May 2022),Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,1 Jun 2022,"Last week in the East Asia Pacific region, fighting between the military and ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) and local resistance groups continued in Myanmar. North Korea conducted its 17th missile test in 2022. In the Philippines, there was an increase in violence related to ongoing Islamist and communist rebel insurgencies. In Thailand, military forces clashed with Malay Muslim Separatists in the Deep South after a lull in violence during Ramadan. In Indonesia, a protest against a same-sex couple was recorded in West Java amid parliamentary discussion on a bill potentially outlawing homosexuality. In South Korea, disability advocates protested throughout last week to demand improvements to mobility and disability rights. New Zealand extended the deployment of military personnel in the Solomon Islands to support the country’s security. In China**,** student demonstrations increased in universities opposing COVID-19 restrictions., In Myanmar, fighting between the military and EAOs and local resistance groups continued across multiple parts of the country last week, including Mon, Shan, Kachin, and Chin states. In Mon state, a combined force of the Karen National Union/Karen National Liberation Army (KNU/KNLA), the People’s Defense Force (PDF), and the Kyaikhto Revolution Force (KRF) simultaneously attacked the central police station and the Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) 207 base in Thein Za Yat town, Kyaikto township. The combined force fired artillery shells and killed a military sergeant in the fighting (Myanmar Now, 26 May 2022). ACLED’s Subnational Surge Tracker first warned of increased violence to come in Mon in the past month., In southern Shan state, the military fired artillery and conducted clearance operations targeting EAOs and local resistance groups in the hills near eastern Pekon Lake and the surrounding villages last week. In response, a combined force of the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force (KNDF), Karenni National Progressive Party/Karenni Army (KNPP/KA), Pekon PDF, and Southern Shan Revolution Youth (SSRY) attacked and occupied the Hsee Mi Lawt village military base in southern Pekon Lake on 24 May. Military offensives began in the area after a combined force of the KNDF, KNPP/KA, Pekon PDF, Inle PDF, and SSRY overran a military outpost in Nyaungshwe township on 12 May. Violence in Shan-South is both common and highly volatile; it is considered an area of ‘extreme risk’ by ACLED’s Volatility and Risk Predictability Index., In Kachin state, the Kachin Independence Organization/Kachin Independence Army (KIO/KIA) launched multiple mine attacks against a military convoy last week. Attacks were reported near Hway Hkar and Hseng Taung villages of Hpakant Township and near Tanja village of Puta-O township between 22 and 27 May, causing military casualties (Kachinland News, 23 May 2022). The attacks came as the military increased movements in areas controlled by the KIA’s 6th Battalion, 9th Brigade, transporting reinforcements, weapons, and ammunition over the last week (Kachinland News, 23 May 2022)., Elsewhere, in southern Chin state, the military clashed with the United League of Arakan/Arakan Army (ULA/AA) in Paletwa township on 26 May. Following the clash, the military council issued a curfew, restricting locals from traveling between 6pm and 6am (Radio Free Asia, 27 May 2022)., North Korea conducted its 17th test missile launch in 2022 last week. On 25 May, a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and two shorter-range missiles were test-fired from waters in Sunan, Pyongyang, towards the ocean off the country’s east coast (AP, 25 May 2022). The test came hours after US President Joe Biden completed a trip to South Korea and Japan, where he agreed to new measures to deter North Korea (Channel News Asia, 25 May 2022)., Last week in the Philippines, the military carried out a major ground assault with air and artillery support against the Dawlah Islamiyah-Toraife Group in Datu Salibo town, Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Two militants were killed, while 17 militants – including the group’s leader, Abu Toraife – were reportedly wounded. Following the clash, the rebels detonated two IEDs in Soccsksargen. No casualties were reported. A number of militant Islamist groups in the southern Philippines have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS). Dawlah Islamiyah is believed to be an umbrella group for many of these IS-inspired groups (International Crisis Group, 27 June 2019). These trends contribute to the 300% increase in violence in BARMM last month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED’s Subnational Threat Tracker. The Subnational Tracker first warned of increased violence to come in BARMM in the past month., Elsewhere, several clashes between the government and the communist New People’s Army (NPA) also occurred last week, including in the Cordillera Administrative Region, Davao region, and Eastern Visayas. Violence associated with the NPA and Islamist militant insurgencies contributed to the 53% increase in violence in the Philippines last month relative to the past year flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the country in the past month., In Thailand, military forces clashed with Malay Muslim separatists in Narathiwat last week. On 25 May, Malay Muslim separatists opened fire and threw bombs at an army base near the Thailand-Malaysia border, injuring three soldiers. The attack comes after a lull in violence in recent weeks, coinciding with a temporary truce between the Thai government and Barisan Revolusi Nasional Melayu (BRN) during Ramadan, from 3 April to 14 May., In Indonesia, a group of villagers protested in front of a same-sex couple’s home in Cugenang district, Cianjur regency, West Java, on 22 May, demanding the couple leave the neighborhood. This event comes as the Indonesian parliament discusses a bill that would outlaw homosexuality (Benar News, 24 May 2022). Meanwhile, on 23 May, the Indonesian government summoned a British diplomat after the UK embassy in Jakarta displayed a rainbow flag in support of the LGBT+ community. Such incidents have been criticized by human rights activists as potentially increasing the likelihood of violence and discrimination against minorities (Benar News, 24 May 2022)., In South Korea, disability advocates took to the streets last week, calling for policies to improve the basic rights of people with disabilities. On 26 May, hundreds of protesters affiliated with the Korean Parents’ Network for People with Disabilities (KPNPD) held a protest march (News1, 26 May 2022), demanding a state-run support system for families of people with developmental disabilities. On 27 May, members of eight disability advocacy organizations picketed in front of President Yoon Suk-yeol’s office, calling for better access to polling stations ahead of local elections on 1 June (YNA, 27 May 2022). Meanwhile, Solidarity Against Disability Discrimination (SADD) staged subway-riding protests throughout the week, urging the government to improve mobility rights, including demands for greater accessibility on public transportation., Meanwhile, on 25 May, the New Zealand government announced that it would extend the deployment of New Zealand Defense Force troops in the Solomon Islands until at least May 2023, to continue providing support to the country’s security apparatus (RNZ, 27 May 2022). This follows a recent security agreement between Beijing and Honiara in April (Reuters, 25 May 2022), amid competition in the Pacific between China and the US, Australia, and New Zealand (CNN, 21 April 2022)., In China, university students continued to rally against COVID-19 restrictions last week. At China University of Political Science and Law, Beijing Normal University, and Tianjin University, students demanded the right to return to their hometowns amid ongoing restrictions. In Tianjin, students had been confined to their dorms, studying online since January (RFA, 27 May 2022). Following the protests, university students in Beijing were allowed to return home, ahead of the upcoming anniversary of the 4 June Tiananmen Square protests (SCMP, 25 May 2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/acled-regional-overview-east-asia-pacific-21-27-may-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",1 Jun 2022,"Myanmar, The total number of IDPs in Myanmar has crossed 1 million for the first time, including close to 700,000 people displaced since the February 2021 coup. The latest surge in IDPs was caused by clashes between the military junta and resistance fighters in the Sagaing Region that intensified from April and caused the new displacement of around 82,000 people over 9–23 May. The region has also reported the most fatalities since the coup, with a total of around 8,200 -- around half of these occurring in 2022. The clashes have disrupted the harvest in Sagaing and are hampering the delivery of crops to the market, aggravating livelihood vulnerabilities and food insecurity. The main needs of the IDPs in Sagaing are food, healthcare, and shelter, and more than 170,000 IDPs are in urgent need of WASH assistance. Provision of aid, especially food security assistance, has been hindered due to frequent clashes and insecurity., Go to Myanmar page, Niger, Attacks by non-state armed groups have intensified in the Tillaberi region, resulting in over 40 civilians killed since the beginning of May. More than 15,000 people have fled their villages and arrived in Torodi and Makalondi communes in the past three weeks. The continuing influx of displaced people means humanitarian needs are rising in Torodi and Makalondi communes, where hundreds of internally displaced people were already living with the host community. The violence caused the closure of 7 markets and 148 schools, affecting more than 15,000 students. Around 1.2 million people in Tillaberi are severely food insecure due to violence, drought, and poor harvests in 2021. The food situation could worsen for this population, composed mainly of farmers and pastoralists, as the lean season is starting. Food, water, shelter, health and protection are the most urgent needs., Go to Niger page, Nigeria, Following a series of attacks and threats by armed gunmen between 16 and 22 May, around 5,500 people were displaced to neighbouring wards in the Bakura, Bukkuyum, and Gusau Local Government Areas (Zamfara state). Some 61 people were killed in the attacks, 58 others injured, cattle were stolen, and food supplies looted. The main needs of displaced people include shelter, food, security, and NFIs. Some of the displaced people are farmers, who were forced to leave their farmlands and flee to safety. Since the escalation of banditry in 2019, farmland has become increasingly abandoned in northwestern states including Zamfara. Banditry is one of the drivers of food insecurity in Zamfara state, with nearly 1.2 million people projected to face Crisis (IPC Phase 3) and worse food security outcomes over June-August 2022., Go to Nigeria page",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/crisisinsight-weekly-picks-01-june-2022

Avoiding a Return to War in Myanmar’s Rakhine State,Analysis,ICG,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",1 Jun 2022,"An unofficial ceasefire has kept Rakhine State quiet compared to much of Myanmar following the 2021 coup. But friction is building between the military and ethnic Rakhine fighters. The parties should strike a formal deal to avert a return to war., What’s new? After an informal ceasefire in late 2020, the Arakan Army used the lull in fighting to consolidate control of much of central and northern Rakhine State. Distracted by fallout from the 2021 coup, Myanmar’s military did little to oppose it at first, but rising tensions may lead to renewed combat., Why does it matter? Many Rakhine State residents, including some Rohingya, have welcomed the shift to Arakan Army control, but the situation remains fraught. The ceasefire is fragile and the Arakan Army has grown significantly more powerful over the past eighteen months. A return to conflict would have devastating consequences for everyone in Rakhine., What should be done? The Myanmar military and Arakan Army should avoid provoking a new war and formalise their ceasefire instead. The Arakan Army should eschew restrictions on humanitarian aid organisations, which should better coordinate their dealings with the group. Naypyitaw and Dhaka should open dialogue with the Arakan Army on Rohingya repatriation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/avoiding-return-war-myanmars-rakhine-state
Myanmar: Number of children out of school more than doubles in two years,News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",1 Jun 2022,"1 June 2022 – The number of children out of school in Myanmar has more than doubled in two years, with about half of the country’s children now missing out on a formal education due to COVID-19 school closures and escalating insecurity, according to Save the Children., Enrolment in schools has dropped by up to 80% in two years in some parts of the country, the aid organisation said, with at least 7.8 million children out of school[i]., This comes after the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of places of learning globally in early 2020. In Myanmar, schools were fully or partially closed for 15 months due to the pandemic[ii]., Attacks on schools, teachers and students have surged over the past year due to the conflict, leaving many of them scared to return to the classroom, and in some cases with no schools left to attend. Schools and children must be protected at all times, Save the Children said., There were at least 260 attacks on schools between May 2021 and April this year, according to Save the Children, with explosions in and around school buildings accounting for 190 – nearly three quarters – of the incidents., In April this year, explosive devices were discovered at four schools or education offices, and there were three explosions in or very close to schools. There were also 33 recorded cases of schools or education offices being set on fire, and 10 direct attacks on teachers and education staff., In March and April this year, Save the Children also recorded 10 incidents in which schools were occupied by armed actors in the 32 townships where its education teams work. It said the actual number of school occupations across the country is likely to be much higher., Kyi*, 14 , from Magway Region, Myanmar, said: “I haven’t been to school since they closed due to COVID. I was a Grade 6 student before COVID. Due to the fighting, and unstable situation, teachers didn’t go back to our school and the village. There have been no teachers in my village since the fighting began. I think they have also had to flee and hide in a safe place like us due to the fighting. I now live in a temporary tent in a jungle after fleeing from my village., “My dream is to be a businesswoman. My family’s small grocery store inspired the idea. I am unhappy and so sad when I think about my future. To become my dream, I think I must study hard and need better learning opportunities. I want to learn English, I want to learn other things at school, and I want to meet with my friends and teachers. It has been a long time since I have had a chance to meet with them.”, Emma Wagner, head of Education Policy and Advocacy at Save the Children, said: “It’s really shocking that so many children are out of school, but when you think about it, it should come as no surprise. The COVID-19 pandemic propelled a worldwide education emergency for children. We raised the alarm early on that children were at risk of dropping out of school altogether due to being forced into labour or early marriage., “In Myanmar, conflict has contributed to a perfect storm for the country’s children. Every one of these attacks on schools is an attack on the future of an entire generation of Myanmar children, who are missing out on the opportunity to learn. That’s something that we absolutely cannot and must not accept.”, “We need to see an immediate end to attacks on schools.”, Save the Children is urging the UN Security Council and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to urgently take concrete action to protect the futures of children in Myanmar., Myanmar also desperately needs more humanitarian assistance from the international community, Save the Children said, with the UN humanitarian response plan having just 10.4% of the funding needed., Save the Children implements programmes across Myanmar and its staff remain fully committed to helping the most vulnerable children in Myanmar, especially during this time of conflict and crisis., ENDS, *name has been changed to protect anonymity, [i] Methodology for this estimate: Just over 25% of Myanmar’s population of an estimated 53.89 million is under 14, according to official statistics. This is roughly 13.5 million. 7.8 million is more than half of 13.5 million.

ILO to launch Myanmar eLearning Programme on Child Labour to bolster social protection and community action,News and Press Release,ILO,Protection and Human Rights,30 May 2022,"ILO (Myanmar) launches eLearning Programme on child labour., YANGON (ILO News) - On the back of the 5th Global Conference on the Elimination of Child Labour, ILO Myanmar has announced the upcoming release of a Myanmar eLearning Programme on Child Labour to enable stakeholders to take action against child labour., Delivered in Myanmar and English language, the nine-module interactive course is set to go live at the ILO’s digital learning platform on June 12, the World Day Against Child Labour., The course aims to equip civil society partners, social workers, employers and worker’s organizations to effectively assess and address cases of child labour within their communities. The modules consist of a live, instructor-led component and an ‘on-demand’ online component. It also provides participants with comprehensive information and tools to design interventions contributing to the elimination of child labour., “Economic challenges and school closures due to the Covid 19 pandemic, political and security crisis in Myanmar are exacerbating child labour in Myanmar. With millions of children at risk, capacity building and collective and timely responses have become even more critical,” said Mr Donglin Li, ILO Myanmar Liaison Officer/Representative., The role of social protection in the elimination of Child Labour, The ILO and UNICEF at Headquarters launched a new report last week during the 5th Global Conference to Eliminate Child Labour that estimates that 60 million children – 1 in 10 worldwide – were in child labour at the beginning of 2020. Without effective action, that number could rise by 8.9 million by the end of 2022, due to higher poverty and increased vulnerability., Children in conflict areas without proper access to social protection are even more likely to become involved in work and less likely to get an education. According to another report launched last week by the ILO , the incidence of child labour in countries affected by armed conflict was 77 per cent higher than the global average, and the incidence of hazardous work was 50 per cent higher., Delegates at the 5th Global Conference on the Elimination of Child Labour last week have already adopted the Durban Call to Action which outlines commitments in six different areas to end child labour, including strengthening the prevention and elimination of child labour, including its worst forms, and achieving universal access to social protection., If most countries put proper social protection measures in place, child labour can decline by 15 million by the end of 2022, thus allowing a significant improvement in sustainable development goals (SDG) 8.7., The ILO is the only tripartite United Nations agency devoted to promoting rights at work, encourage decent employment opportunities, enhance social protection and strengthen dialogue on work-related issues.

"""Bullets rained from the sky”: War crimes and displacement in eastern Myanmar",Analysis,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,31 May 2022,"Myanmar: Military onslaught in eastern states amounts to collective punishment, Post-coup military assault in Kayin and Kayah States includes war crimes and likely crimes against humanity, More than 150,000 displaced, with entire villages emptied and burned, Amnesty International interviewed almost 100 people and visited border area, Myanmar’s military has been systematically committing widespread atrocities in recent months, including unlawfully killing, arbitrarily detaining and forcibly displacing civilians in two eastern states, Amnesty International said today in a new report., The report, “Bullets rained from the sky”: War crimes and displacement in eastern Myanmar, found that Myanmar’s military has subjected Karen and Karenni civilians to collective punishment via widespread aerial and ground attacks, arbitrary detentions that often result in torture or extrajudicial executions, and the systematic looting and burning of villages., The violence in Kayin and Kayah States reignited in the wake of last year’s military coup and escalated from December 2021 to March 2022, killing hundreds of civilians and displacing more than 150,000 people., “The world’s attention may have moved away from Myanmar since last year’s coup, but civilians continue to pay a high price. The military’s ongoing assault on civilians in eastern Myanmar has been widespread and systematic, likely amounting to crimes against humanity,” said Rawya Rageh, Senior Crisis Adviser at Amnesty International., “Alarm bells should be ringing: the ongoing killing, looting and burning bear all the hallmarks of the military’s signature tactic of collective punishment, which it has repeatedly used against ethnic minorities across the country.”, Post-coup surge in violence, For decades, ethnic armed organizations in Myanmar, including in Kayin and Kayah States, have been engaged in struggles for greater rights and autonomy. Fragile ceasefires in place in both states since 2012 broke down after the February 2021 coup, and new armed groups have emerged. In its operations, the military has relentlessly attacked civilians., Some attacks appear to have directly targeted civilians as a form of collective punishment against those perceived to support an armed group or the wider post-coup uprising. In other cases, the military has fired indiscriminately into civilian areas where there are also military targets. Direct attacks on civilians, collective punishment, and indiscriminate attacks that kill or injure civilians violate international humanitarian law and constitute war crimes., Attacks on a civilian population must be widespread or systematic to amount to crimes against humanity; in Kayin and Kayah States, they are both, for crimes including murder, torture, forcible transfer, and persecution on ethnic grounds., Unlawful strikes, In its ongoing operations, Myanmar’s military has repeatedly fired explosive weapons with wide-area effects into populated civilian areas. Dozens of witnesses told Amnesty International about barrages that lasted days at a time. The organization documented 24 attacks by artillery or mortars between December 2021 and March 2022 that killed or injured civilians or that caused destruction to civilian homes, schools, health facilities, churches, and monasteries., For example, on 5 March 2022, as families were at dinner, the military shelled Ka Law Day village, Hpapun Township, Kayin State, killing seven people, including a woman who was eight months pregnant. A close family member of four of the people who were killed said he had to sit in his house all night looking at the bodies, for fear of being injured by further shelling, before burying them in the morning., Many people described the military’s use of fighter jets and attack helicopters as particularly terrifying. Witnesses described not being able to sleep at night out of fear of air strikes, or fleeing to seek shelter in bunkers and caves., Amnesty International documented eight air strikes on villages and an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp in eastern Myanmar in the first three months of 2022. The attacks, which killed nine civilians and injured at least nine more, destroyed civilian homes and religious buildings. In almost all documented attacks, only civilians appear to have been present., In one case, at around 6pm on 23 February 2022, a fighter jet fired on Dung Ka Mee village, Demoso Township, Kayah State, killing two civilian men and injuring several others. Amnesty International interviewed two witnesses and a relative of one of the deceased as well as an aid worker who responded after the attack. They said there was no fighting that evening and that the nearest armed group base was a mile or more away., A local resident, a 46-year-old farmer who witnessed the attack, said the military aircraft made three passes, firing guns and a rocket:, “When that fighter jet was flying toward us in a nose-down position, I was numb… When they fired the rocket, I got myself together and realized I had to run [to a bunker]… We were shocked to see the dust and debris come towards us… There is a two-story building… The family lives upstairs and the downstairs is a mobile phone store. This building collapsed and it was also on fire.”, Another witness, a 40-year-old farmer, saw the remains of a neighbour’s body:, “We couldn’t even put them in a coffin, we put them in a plastic bag and buried them. People had to pick up the body pieces and put them in a bag.” In another incident, the military carried out an air strike on Ree Khee Bu IDP camp at around 1am on 17 January 2022, killing a man in his 50s as well as 15- and 12-year-old sisters., Extrajudicial executions, The report documents how Myanmar’s military carried out arbitrary detentions of civilians on the basis of their ethnicity or because they were suspected of supporting the anti-coup movement. Often, detainees were tortured, forcibly disappeared or extrajudicially executed., In one of many cases where soldiers extrajudicially executed civilians who ventured out from displacement sites to collect food or belongings, three farmers from San Pya 6 Mile village in Kayah State went missing in January 2022. Their decomposed bodies were found in a pit latrine around two weeks later., The brother of one of the victims said he identified the men by their clothes and the state of their teeth. Soldiers fired on him and others as they tried to retrieve the bodies; they could only return to finish the burial a month later., In a massacre that prompted rare international condemnation, soldiers near Mo So village in Kayah State’s Hpruso Township reportedly stopped at least 35 women, men and children in multiple vehicles on 24 December 2021, and then proceeded to kill them and burn their bodies. Doctors who examined the bodies reportedly said many of the victims had been tied up and gagged, bearing wounds suggesting they were shot or stabbed., Amnesty International maintains that the incident must be investigated as a case of extrajudicial executions. Such killings in armed conflict constitute war crimes., Witnesses also described Myanmar’s military shooting at civilians, including those attempting to flee across a river along the border with Thailand., Looting and burning, Following a pattern from past military operations, soldiers have systematically looted and burned large sections of villages in Kayin and Kayah States. Witnesses from six villages reported having items including jewellery, cash, vehicles and livestock stolen, before homes and other buildings were burned., Four men who fled Wari Suplai village, on the border of Shan and Kayah States, said they watched from nearby farmland as houses went up in flames after most villagers fled on 18 February 2022. They told Amnesty International that the burning went on for days, destroying well over two-thirds of the houses there., “It’s not a house anymore. It’s all ashes — black and charcoal… It’s my life’s savings. It was destroyed within minutes,” said a 38-year-old farmer and father of two young children., Amnesty International’s analysis of fire data and satellite imagery shows how villages were burned, some of them multiple times, in parts of Kayah State. The burning directly tracks military operations from village to village in February and March 2022., A defector from the military’s 66th Light Infantry Division, who was involved in operations in Kayah State until October 2021, told Amnesty International that he witnessed soldiers looting and burning homes: “They don’t have any particular reason [for burning a specific house]. They just want to put the fear in the civilians that ‘This is what we’ll do if you support [the resistance fighters].’ And another thing is to stop the supply and logistics for the local resistance forces… [Soldiers] took everything they could [from a village] and then they burned the rest.”, The violence has caused the mass displacement of more than 150,000 people, including between a third and a half of Kayah State’s entire population. In some cases, entire villages have been emptied of their populations; at times, civilians have had to flee repeatedly in recent months., Displaced people are enduring dire conditions amid food insecurity, scant health care — including for the conflict’s enormous psychosocial impact — and ongoing efforts by the military to obstruct humanitarian aid provision. Aid workers spoke of growing malnutrition and increasing difficulties in reaching displaced people due to the ongoing violence and military restrictions., “Donors and humanitarian organizations must significantly scale up aid to civilians in eastern Myanmar, and the military must halt all restrictions on aid delivery,” said Matt Wells, Amnesty International’s Crisis Response Deputy Director – Thematic Issues., “The military’s ongoing crimes against civilians in eastern Myanmar reflect decades-long patterns of abuse and flagrant impunity. The international community — including ASEAN and UN member states — must tackle this festering crisis now. The UN Security Council must impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Myanmar and refer the situation there to the International Criminal Court.”, Methodology, The report is based on research carried out in March and April 2022, including two weeks on the Thailand-Myanmar border. Amnesty International interviewed 99 people, including dozens of witnesses or survivors of attacks and three defectors from Myanmar’s military., The organization also analysed more than 100 photographs and videos related to human rights violations — showing injuries, destruction and weapon use — in addition to satellite imagery, fire data, and open-source military aircraft flight data.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/bullets-rained-sky-war-crimes-and-displacement-eastern-myanmar

UNICEF is protecting children from this risk by ensuring that Explosive Ordnance Risk Education is integrated across all relevant sectors of its humanitarian response., • As of 23 May, a reported 694,300 civilians have been displaced nationally by the conflict, more than double that of the figure of 320,900 at the end of 2021., • June will mark the traditional start of the academic year, and safe access to education for all children remains an urgent priority across the conflictaffected areas., • The reporting period usually sees the onset of water shortages, especially in Rakhine. To ensure an uninterrupted water supply for internally displaced people (IDPs) and the host communities, UNICEF has initiated a scarcity response to meet the daily water needs of 28,078 IDPs in Pauktaw in Sittwe, and at Ah Agnu IDP site in Meybon township., Funding Overview and Partnerships, The UNICEF Myanmar Country Office is appealing for US$ 151.4 million to respond to the multi-sectoral humanitarian needs of the targeted 1.1 million children in Myanmar in 2022. The Myanmar Humanitarian Needs Overview estimates that, in 2022, a total of 14.4 million people are in need of assistance, including 5 million children. UNICEF wishes to express its deep gratitude to all public and private sector donors for the contributions and pledges received, which have made the current response possible. UNICEF would especially like to thank the generous support received this year from the governments of Japan, Norway, Denmark and the United Nations office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA). These funds will contribute to delivering services to affected populations, notably for Child Protection, Water Sanitation and Hygiene, Education, Health and Nutrition programmes and responses. Although 19 per cent of the UNICEF Humanitarian Action for Children requirements were received, the funding gap of 81 per cent is severely affecting the capacity to respond. Without these resources, targeted populations, especially children, who need basic social services will not be able to receive assistance. Continued donor support is critical to continue scaling up the response. UNICEF is thankful for the commitment and dedication of all its partners and colleagues in Myanmar who continue to stay and deliver lifesaving assistance to affected children and women, amidst an incredibly challenging context., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, Children in Myanmar continue to face unprecedented needs, compounded by the national political, security and humanitarian crises, limiting access to services. During the last few weeks, the conflict has continued to deteriorate in the northwest regions of Sagaing, Magway and Chin, with armed clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces, local People’s Defence Forces and Chinland Defence Forces, resulting in an escalation in the displacement of children and their families. At the end of 2021, more than 320,900 civilians had reportedly been displaced. However, in the first quarter of 2022 this figure has more than doubled and, as of 23 May, approximately 694,300 people have been internally displaced in Myanmar since the military coup, with nearly 49 per cent of them (336,600 people) within the Sagaing region. The support from humanitarian partners to civilians in new areas of conflict remains limited to urban zones, as constraints on access to rural conflict-affected regions are resulting in lower coverage there., The Mine Action Area of Responsibility (AoR) reports that, as a direct result of the conflict, many areas have become contaminated with landmines and explosive remnants of war. The consequent number and frequency of casualties have propelled Myanmar into becoming one of the most mine-affected countries in the world. To protect children against these risks, the Mine Action AoR is working towards supporting the integration and mainstreaming of Explosive Ordnance Risk Education across sectors of the humanitarian response, in order to teach children and adults how to identify, report and protect themselves against explosive hazards. Although a recent survey in Rakhine has highlighted the dangers of mines and explosive remnants of war in six villages, a national mapping has demonstrated the gaps across all regions in mine action interventions., To reach the children in dire need of assistance, improved and unimpeded access is necessary, including secured physical access, reduced bureaucratic impediments, lessened scrutiny, functioning telecommunication networks and alleviated banking restrictions. Nevertheless, UNICEF and its partners continue to scale up their response and adapt their activities through prioritizing strengthening capacity and tailoring programming modalities to cope with the security risks and severe travel restrictions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-myanmar-humanitarian-situation-report-no-4-1-31-may-2022

Cash transfer programmes review in Kachin/Northern Shan and Rakhine states,Evaluation and Lessons Learned,Crown Agents,"Coordination
Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction",31 May 2022,"CONTEXT, The use of Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) in Myanmar dates to 2008, with the first CVA emergency response to Cyclone Nargis. By 2020, more than one million people received a total of 35.6 million USD worth of CVA, distributed by 63 organisations nationwide. Even so, government acceptance of CVA was not uniform in all contexts and sectors of implementation. On 1St February 2021, the Myanmar military overthrew the government in a coup d'etat. The combined effects of COVID-19 as well as the February 2021 coup have turned back the development clock by years. The resulting economic crisis comprised of inflation, depreciation of the Myanmar kyat (M MK) against the United States dollar (USD), as well as a liquidity crisis/low supply of bank notes and closure of banks., Objectives In light of this, this review aimed to harness lessons learned from the design, implementation and monitoring of past and current humanitarian CVA projects by humanitarian actors before and after 1St February 2021 in order to inform future crisis response in Rakhine, Kachin and Northern Shan states. Accordingly, the review mapped the use of CVA and CVA stakeholders, collated qualitative accounts of challenges and opportunities faced by humanitarian organisations, identified adaptations to the change in economic situation, market functionality and protection risks., Methodology The review took place from October 2021 to March 2022 and utilised a qualitative approach relying on a variety of primary and secondary data sources, both capturing qualitative and quantitative data. The research team reviewed a total of 56 documents and interviewed 39 humanitarian practitioners., Findings, Yearly CVA volume, • Rakhine accounted for the largest volume of cash transfer programming in 2021 with a total of USD21,212,651. This is a significant increase compared with 2019 and 2020, USD 6,294,712 and USD20,714.603 respectively., • In Kachin and Northern Shan. the CVA volume in 2020 amounted to USD 7.261.976 and USD 1,022.432 respectively. In 2021, the volume in Kachin and Northern Shan increased to USD 8,856,565 and USD1,420,218., CVA actors, • In Rakhine, WFP accounted for the largest share of the CVA volume transferred with 75% (USD 15,586,124) in 2020 and 93% (USD 19,578,449) in 2021. 34% of the assistance was distributed to recipients by local and national organisations acting as implementing/cooperating partners of international organisations., • In Kachin and Northern Shari WFP Is the largest and most active cash Implementer accounting for 76% IUSD778,6051 and 59% (USD 4,287.130) of total transfer volumes respectively in 2020. This remains similar in 2021 with WFP representing 63% (USD 5,380,683) in Kachin and 95% (USD 1,348,369). 57% of CVA in Kachin and 42% in Northern Shan respectively are distributed to recipients by local and national organisations acting as implementing/cooperating partners of international organisations., Sector, • In Rakhine, Kachin and Northern Shan.

Protection and Human Rights
Recovery and Reconstruction",31 May 2022,"CONTEXT, The use of Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) in Myanmar dates to 2008, with the first CVA emergency response to Cyclone Nargis. By 2020, more than one million people received a total of 35.6 million USD worth of CVA, distributed by 63 organisations nationwide. Even so, government acceptance of CVA was not uniform in all contexts and sectors of implementation. On 1St February 2021, the Myanmar military overthrew the government in a coup d'etat. The combined effects of COVID-19 as well as the February 2021 coup have turned back the development clock by years. The resulting economic crisis comprised of inflation, depreciation of the Myanmar kyat (M MK) against the United States dollar (USD), as well as a liquidity crisis/low supply of bank notes and closure of banks., Objectives In light of this, this review aimed to harness lessons learned from the design, implementation and monitoring of past and current humanitarian CVA projects by humanitarian actors before and after 1St February 2021 in order to inform future crisis response in Rakhine, Kachin and Northern Shan states. Accordingly, the review mapped the use of CVA and CVA stakeholders, collated qualitative accounts of challenges and opportunities faced by humanitarian organisations, identified adaptations to the change in economic situation, market functionality and protection risks., Methodology The review took place from October 2021 to March 2022 and utilised a qualitative approach relying on a variety of primary and secondary data sources, both capturing qualitative and quantitative data. The research team reviewed a total of 56 documents and interviewed 39 humanitarian practitioners., Findings, Yearly CVA volume, • Rakhine accounted for the largest volume of cash transfer programming in 2021 with a total of USD21,212,651. This is a significant increase compared with 2019 and 2020, USD 6,294,712 and USD20,714.603 respectively., • In Kachin and Northern Shan. the CVA volume in 2020 amounted to USD 7.261.976 and USD 1,022.432 respectively. In 2021, the volume in Kachin and Northern Shan increased to USD 8,856,565 and USD1,420,218., CVA actors, • In Rakhine, WFP accounted for the largest share of the CVA volume transferred with 75% (USD 15,586,124) in 2020 and 93% (USD 19,578,449) in 2021. 34% of the assistance was distributed to recipients by local and national organisations acting as implementing/cooperating partners of international organisations., • In Kachin and Northern Shari WFP Is the largest and most active cash Implementer accounting for 76% IUSD778,6051 and 59% (USD 4,287.130) of total transfer volumes respectively in 2020. This remains similar in 2021 with WFP representing 63% (USD 5,380,683) in Kachin and 95% (USD 1,348,369). 57% of CVA in Kachin and 42% in Northern Shan respectively are distributed to recipients by local and national organisations acting as implementing/cooperating partners of international organisations., Sector, • In Rakhine, Kachin and Northern Shan. CVA for food represented the biggest CVA volume since 2019 until the time of this review.

This includes almost 700,000 people displaced by the conflict and insecurity since the military takeover in February last year., • The monsoon season is now in full swing with strong storms and heavy rain hitting Rakhine, Kachin, southern Shan, and Kayin since April, causing damage to shelters and further compounding existing vulnerabilities.
Humanitarian responses and preparedness efforts are underway in high-risk areas., • Humanitarians continue providing critical life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable people despite access challenges and limited funding. During the first quarter of 2022, 2.6 million people were reached with humanitarian assistance (41 per cent of the 2022 HRP target)., • Inflation in commodity prices, including food, fuel, shelter materials and NFIs, has become a major concern to partners in addressing the needs of the most vulnerable people., • The Nutrition Cluster is facing possible pipeline breaks for both preventative and therapeutic nutrition supplies due to under-funding and taxation issues. Resolution of taxation issues for humanitarian supplies is an urgent priority., • Funding for agriculture support to vulnerable farmers is a priority for food security partners with fears that this lack of investment in livelihoods assistance could lead to food unavailability and unaffordability in rural areas., • Funding has been secured for 270 out of the 550 IDP camp longhouses that need immediate reconstruction in Rakhine. However, there remains a $2.4 million funding gap to repair the remaining 281 longhouses as the monsoon season arrives., • The funding situation for 2022 is now dire with the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) only 10 per cent funded, 5 months into the year, leaving a gap of US$740m (FTS). All clusters are seriously underfunded, threatening their ability to respond to the growing needs and gaps in response., SITUATION OVERVIEW, During the reporting period, various parts of Myanmar have witnessed an escalation in fighting, further entrenching the already fragile humanitarian situation. The impact on civilians is worsening daily with frequent indiscriminate attacks and incidents involving explosive hazards, including landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERWs). According to UN figures, the number of IDPs people since the 2021 military takeover s now exceeds 694,300, bringing the overall number of displaced people across the country to more than one million. 2 Thousands of IDPs who have already fled their homes are being forced to move for a second or third time. An estimated 40,200 people have crossed the borders into neighbouring countries since the takeover.3 More than 12,700 civilian properties, including houses, churches, monasteries, and schools are estimated to have been destroyed during hostilities, although figures are difficult to verify.4 This will make IDP returns more difficult even if the situation improves. Consequently, complex needs are surfacing, requiring immediate humanitarian responses to save lives and protect those affected, supporting them to live in dignified conditions., In addition to this constant risk and fear they are enduring daily, thousands of people across the country are living in distress due to the increasing price of essential commodities, including food and fuel, partly due to the conflict in Ukraine which has impacted global supplies. The price of diesel soared by 20 per cent from February to March 2022, and by another seven per cent from March to April 2022.5 On average, as of mid-April 2022, fuel prices are nearly two and a half times higher than February 2021. 6 This inflation has affected people’s purchasing power and is starting to impact on the work of several clusters, particularly food security and shelter, who depend on commodities to implement their humanitarian programming. Some clusters are facing issues with their suppliers who are no longer honoring contracts because of the price increases., On top of the continued fighting, strong storms and heavy rain have already hit coastal areas of the country, mainly lowlying areas in Rakhine, Kayin, Kachin and Shan states, since April this year, causing varying degrees of damage to civilian structures, including houses and shelters. This has further compounded pre-existing vulnerabilities of the affected people, particularly IDPs in protracted displacement sites. Humanitarian actors, including local partners, have immediately reached affected families, where possible repairing the damage and providing tarpaulins and emergency NFIs, but the needs far exceed existing resources, capacities and access. Preparedness efforts by both humanitarian actors and the de facto authorities have been underway since the first quarter of 2022 (see details in article below). More funding is critically needed to ensure efficient responses in the event of a wide-scale natural disaster., Across the country, humanitarian actors, including the UN, INGOs, and local partners, continue responding to both preexisting and emerging needs wherever possible, providing critical life-saving assistance in spite of the constrained operational environment and limited funding. As of the end of the first quarter of 2022, 2.6 million people had been reached with humanitarian assistance. This represents 41 per cent of the people targeted (6.2 million) in the 2022 HRP7 demonstrating the humanitarian community’s capacity to scale-up logistically when access and funding are available.
The funding situation for 2022 is now dire with the Humanitarian Response Plan only 10 per cent funded, 5 months into the year, leaving a gap of US$740m (FTS). The consequences will be grave if this level of underfunding continues in the remainder of 2022. Humanitarian partners will be forced to cut back on their support at a time when this assistance is needed the most, particularly as the monsoon season is just getting underway.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-update-no-18-31-may-2022

The low-pressure area over the North Bay of Bengal persisted from late July to October 2021, generating medium to heavy rainfall., During the monsoon season, Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) issued flood advisory warnings and weather forecast that could impact the major rivers and their water level, particularly, for rivers and dams such as the Ayeyarwady River and the Sittaung River. As of August 2021, around 125,000 people were affected by different floods. Given the DMH forecasts for the monsoon season and the likelihood of more floods and their humanitarian consequences, the MRCS requested this DREF assistance to improve its preparedness capacity. Thanks to this DREF supported operation, the MRCS procured and pre-positioned relief items (non-food items), provided capacity building sessions to its staff and volunteers, and distributed household items to disaster affected households. Details of activities, implemented under this emergency operation, are explained under the sections of Operational Strategy and Detailed Implementation Plan below., This emergency operation was implemented within the context of Complex Emergency situation in Myanmar, which began with the military intervention on 1 February 2021 and has had major humanitarian implications.

Protection and Human Rights",27 May 2022,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Kaw T’Ree (Kawkareik), Kruh Tuh (Kyonedoe) and Noh T’Kaw (Kyainseikgyi) townships, Dooplaya District in March 2022 including killing, fighting, indiscriminate shelling, air strikes and displacement. Fighting and indiscriminate shelling has caused the displacement of villagers and property damage. In some cases, entire villages have been forced to flee. Displaced villagers have settled in different places including monasteries, the houses of relatives living in other villages, and in displacement sites along the Moei River, and are in need of food and medicine.In one incident of shelling, a 17-year-old girl was hit by a mortar that was fired by State Administration Council (SAC) troops into Htee Moo Hta village, Noh Hpoh village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township and died immediately. Three other villagers were injured by the shelling. Two mortar shells that landed in Taung Kyar Inn village, Nga Pyin Ma village tract, Kruh Tuh Township after heavy shelling on March 23rd 2022 did not explode and have yet to be removed. The SAC launched an air strike twice in Bler Doh village, Thay Baw Boh village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township on March 27th 2022 following heavy fighting with the local Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) and Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO) combined troops.[1], Fighting, indiscriminate shelling and displacement, On the evening of March 3rd 2022, in Bu Baw and Htee K’Pler villages, Choo K’Lee village tract[2], Kaw T’Ree (Kawkareik) Township, skirmishes occurred between State Administration Council (SAC)[3] troops and the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[4]. The SAC also flew helicopters over the villages and indiscriminately fired [mortar shells]. This caused villagers to be terrified and flee to K--- Place near Noh Hpa Doh village [a Thai-Karen village in Thailand]. Villagers [IDPs] are in need of food. Some of them have nausea and are coughing and so are also in need of medicine. Some children have diarrhoea., On March 11th 2022, fighting happened between the SAC and Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO)[5] in Taung Kyar Inn village, Nga Pyin Ma village tract, Kruh Tuh (Kyonedoe) Township, Dooplaya District. This fighting resulted in the displacement of many villagers. Some villagers sought refuge in the nearby monasteries and some fled to other villages to stay with their relatives. On the first day, displaced villagers returned to their homes shortly after the fighting stopped. However, as fighting happened again on the night of March 12th 2022, the villagers had to flee to other nearby villages including T--- village, Th’Meik Dut village tract, Kruh Tuh Township. The head of T--- village provided some food and shelter for the displaced villagers. He said that there was no support from organisations or monitoring of the situation. The displaced people are in urgent need of humanitarian aid. There were more than 60 people taking refuge in T--- village on March 12th 2022., On March 14th 2022, fighting happened between the SAC and the People’s Defence Force (PDF)[6] in Seikgyi Town, Noh T’Kaw (Kyainseikgyi) Township, Dooplaya District. On that day, at 9:00 am, SAC Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[7] #432 left their camp. The PDF planted a trip-wire bomb, which allowed them to ambush the SAC troops. As a result, fighting broke out for a few minutes. From 9:00 am to 11:00 am, SAC soldiers continued firing both 79 mm guns and other small guns around Seikgyi Town. Due to the indiscriminate gunfire, a civilian named U M---, aged over 40 years old, was hit in his stomach by a bullet while sitting at a coffee shop in town. On the same day, he was taken to the Mawlamyine 300-bed hospital by an ambulance car. Some villagers who live in the area around Noh T’Kaw village, Noh T’Kaw village tract also temporarily fled to other nearby villages [due to the fighting in Seikgyi Town]. They returned to their homes [on March 16th 2022]., From March 15th 2022 at 8:30 pm to March 16th 2022 at around 3:30 am, fighting broke out for about seven hours between the combined forces of the SAC Infantry Battalion (IB)[8] #32 and LIB #559 and the KNDO in Thay Baw Boh village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township, Dooplaya District. During the period of fighting, more than 20 mortar shells were fired, as well as small guns. The local villagers [in the surrounding area] saw an unexploded mortar shell fall on the main road between Myawaddy Town and Waw Lay village, Waw Lay village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township. Almost every villager in Thay Baw Boh village tract had already fled to hide, so no villagers were injured., On March 23rd 2022 at 8:00 pm, SAC LIB #231 and LIB #230, based in Tada Kyo village, Hlaing Wa village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township indiscriminately fired 120 mm mortars and bullets into Taung Kyar Inn village, Nga Pyin Ma village tract, Kruh Tuh Township. One house was destroyed by the shelling. Two of the mortar shells that fell into Taung Kyar Inn village remained there, unexploded. The two unexploded shells have not yet been removed by any organisation., On March 23rd 2022 at 2:00 pm, fighting occurred for a few minutes between the SAC and PDF in Thanmya village, Kyaw Kay Hkoh (Da Li) village tract, Noh T’Kaw Township. SAC soldiers, who were in a truck, conducted indiscriminate shelling in the direction of the village using both artillery and guns. Over 10 houses were hit by the indiscriminate shelling. The following day, March 24th 2022, at 2:45 pm, a woman who was six months pregnant, Ma W--- aged 39 years old, was shot twice by a civilian [one bullet hit her left chest and one her right arm], while she was sitting in front of her shop. She was referred to Mawlamyine Hospital., On March 20th 2022, fighting broke out between the SAC and the combined KNLA and KNDO in Oo Kray Hta village, Thay Baw Boh village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township, Dooplaya District. During the fighting, SAC LIB #302 fired multiple mortars into Oo Kray Hta village, which damaged six houses and a monastery.

When they arrived at Hkler Kloh Place on March 27th at 11:00 am, heavy fighting started between the marching SAC troops and KNDO and KLNA combined troops. There were a high number of deaths and injuries on the SAC side. Local villagers believe this is why two SAC helicopters flew over the area and conducted air strikes in Bler Doh area on March 27th at 2:00 pm. Villagers in Bler Doh, Thay Baw Boh and Lay Gaw villages, Thay Baw Boh village tract no longer felt safe to stay in their village and so they fled. Bler Doh villagers fled to Thailand but the Thai soldiers did not allow them to stay and they had to return to Burma. On March 27th, SAC helicopters flew around the area of Bler Doh village [and conducted air strikes] twice. They also came again on March 28th at 5:20 am.

Staying at an ICRC-supported physical rehabilitation centre in Kyaing Tong, it was hard for him to return home because of challenges posed by COVID-19., Pyae Phyo Maung first sought treatment at the centre years ago. It was there that he met the centre's wheelchair basketball coach, Maung Maung Lwin. He has been involved in the wheelchair basketball community across the country ever since., ""As a sports enthusiast, I thought there was no hope of playing again after I lost my leg. When I got the chance to play, I was so glad to be able to reconnect with my love for sport,"" he says., Earning a livelihood has been particularly hard during the pandemic and an added layer of stress for those living in an area of Myanmar that has also been impacted by decades of conflict.

Both programmes are now paused because of the pandemic. ""Thinking positively, I meet a lot of people from different backgrounds here. We all have to stay together in this camp, which is a good thing,"" says Roi Seng., Among the greatest challenges for displaced communities facing COVID-19 is meeting basic daily needs – as finding work gets increasingly tough and the cost of living rises. ""I feel left behind because of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" says Roi Seng. ""Living is harder."", Right on Shan State's border with Thailand is the town of Tachileik. Here, 22-year-old Hsu Myat Mon volunteers with the Myanmar Red Cross Society, helping those impacted by COVID-19., I joined because it's my passion. I wanted to become an MRCS volunteer to get a chance to assist others, helping them without hoping for anything in return, Daily volunteer activities include raising awareness of COVID-19 prevention measures, assisting with disinfection, helping those in need of oxygen cylinders and raising money for those who can't afford medicine. ""When I tried to put on the PPE gown for the very first time, I did not know how to wear it and it looked like an alien or astronaut costume,"" Hsu Myat Mon says. ""Our team looked at each other and laughed so loudly – it was such a memorable moment for me."", Shan State, much like Kachin to the north and Rakhine to the west, has endured years of conflict. Since February this year, Myanmar has also seen new waves of violence spread across the country., For Hsu Myat Mon, these overlapping challenges – including natural disasters – require the overcoming of differences in a collective effort to respond. ""In Myanmar, people are not only confronting COVID-19. I would ask people to stop hating and to help instead,"" Hsu Myat Mon says., The ICRC is a neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian organization that has been working with communities impacted by conflict in Myanmar for more than 30 years. From providing emergency relief to sustainable responses to protracted conflict, we often work directly alongside the Myanmar Red Cross Society. Since the outset of COVID-19, we have adapted the delivery of our aid to include an effective health response.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-people-face-overlapping-challenges
Statement: Save the Children deeply saddened by deaths of Rohingya children and adults following boat capsize,News and Press Release,Save the Children,Protection and Human Rights,25 May 2022,"Save the Children is deeply saddened by the deaths of at least 17 people, including children, when a boat carrying 90 Rohingya refugees capsized off the coast of Myanmar on Saturday., Several of the bodies found were children aged between 11 and 12, according to local reports. More than 50 people remain missing., May is the first month of the region's monsoon season, increasing the risk of capsizing to those taking perilous sea voyages in search of a better life. Hundreds of Rohingya have died in similar boat incidents in the past few years, Save the Children said., Sultana Begum, Regional Humanitarian Advocacy and Policy Manager at Save the Children, said:, ""This should be a wake-up call for us all. The long-drawn-out persecution of Rohingya people has now claimed more innocent lives, among them, children ., ""Past experiences of violence, as well as poverty and insecurity, push Rohingya families to make these deadly sea journeys in search of a better life. These journeys are extremely dangerous, and those fleeing risk death, grave physical and mental harm, and sickness., ""The need to ensure that Rohingya people are safe, respected, and protected is as pressing as ever. Countries across the region should develop a system to monitor refugee boat movements and rapidly respond to prevent further loss of life at sea.

As of 23 May, 47 people have lost their lives in India and more than 1.7 million people have been affected by floods in the states of Assam and Bihar where torrential rainfall submerged farmland and damaged thousands of homes. In Bangladesh, at least 10 people have died, hundreds of houses have been damaged in the districts of Sylhet and Sunamganj, and about 2 million people have been affected. The Government of India is conducting search and rescue missions and is providing assistance to villages cut off by flood waters. In Bangladesh, the flood situation may improve in Sylhet in the coming days but worsen in the low-lying area of Netrokona district. The situation remains particularly difficult in rural areas and where electricity and health services are affected. National authorities are providing water purification tablets, water treatment and sanitation systems. In addition, humanitarian partners have provided dry food, drinking water, and hygiene kits to 4,000 people as well as cash assistance, shelter and health support. A rapid needs assessment is planned for the most affected districts., SRI LANKA, The economic and financial crisis continues to result in severe shortages of fuel, food and medicine and rolling power blackouts Food security has been affected due to rising food prices resulting from fuel shortages and high fertilizer prices affecting production and food supply chains. While overall inflation is high, food inflation in particular is currently running at 25 per cent, hindering access to affordable food. According to the Ministry of Health, health services may run out of essential drugs and medical supplies in the next two months., UN agencies are supporting the Government in coordinating the procurement of urgently needed medical supplies from development partners, supporting farmers with cash transfers and adaptive agricultural practices, and strengthening the social protection system.

Safety and Security",24 May 2022,"On 1 February 2021 the Myanmar armed forces (known as the Tatmadaw) seized control of the country following a general election that the National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide. The military junta that the Tatmadaw established to run the country is officially known as the State Administration Council (SAC). Over the period February–November 2021 hundreds of people, including children, were killed and many injured during nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) protests against the coup and violent SAC crackdowns on those opposing it., Doctors and nurses were arrested for providing medical care to protesters, health workers were injured while providing care to protesters, ambulances were destroyed, and health facilities were raided. In the first few months of 2022 health care in Myanmar continued to be under attack., By the end of 2021 what began as an urban-based protest movement had escalated into a wider conflict extending into the countryside. In September the opposition National Unity Government (NUG) declared war on the Tatmadaw. Shortly after, the Tatmadaw began a brutal offensive throughout the country, razing villages, damaging or destroying health infrastructure with artillery or air strikes, and blocking medical aid to opposition-controlled areas., This update to the one-year report published in February has been prepared by Insecurity Insight, as part of the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition (SHCC).

UNHCR shocked at Rohingya deaths in boat tragedy off Myanmar coast,News and Press Release,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,23 May 2022,"UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is shocked and saddened by reports that more than a dozen Rohingya – including children – have perished at sea off the coast of Myanmar over the weekend., While details remain unclear, initial reports suggest the boat left Sittwe in Rakhine State, Myanmar on 19 May. It encountered bad weather in waters off Ayeyarwady Region, causing it to capsize near the coast of Pathein township on Saturday, 21 May., At least 17 people are feared dead, with distressing reports of bodies found on the shore and the local communities burying the dead., “The latest tragedy shows once again the sense of desperation being felt by Rohingya in Myanmar and in the region,’’ said Indrika Ratwatte, UNHCR’s Director for Asia and the Pacific. “It is shocking to see increasing numbers of children, women and men embarking on these dangerous journeys and eventually losing their lives.”, In Myanmar, UNHCR is urgently seeking more information on survivors that have arrived on shore in order to assess their situation., Over the past decade, thousands of Rohingya have left by sea from the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh and Rakhine State in Myanmar., “The root causes of these deadly journeys need to be addressed. Additionally, all countries in the region must come together to ensure the rescue and disembarkation of all those in distress at sea,” UNHCR’s Ratwatte added., UNHCR reiterates its warning that collective failure to act will continue to lead to tragic and fatal consequences. It is imperative to take action against criminals, smugglers and traffickers who prey on the most vulnerable., UNHCR and partners continue to actively engage refugee and host communities, raising awareness about the risks of falling victim to criminals responsible for these deadly journeys., Some 630 Rohingya have attempted sea journeys across the Bay of Bengal from January to May 2022. Women and children made up 60 per cent of people undertaking these perilous maritime crossings. The risk of abuse at the hands of smugglers and the peril of the sea journey itself are both exacerbated during prolonged journeys, when a safe harbour for disembarkation cannot be found., For more information on this topic, please contact:, In Bangkok, Kasita Rochanakorn, rochanak@unhcr.org, +66 64 932 0803 In Bangkok, Babar Baloch, baloch@unhcr.org, +66 80 086 5611 In Geneva, Shabia Mantoo, mantoo@unhcr.org, +41 79 337 7650",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unhcr-shocked-rohingya-deaths-boat-tragedy-myanmar-coast
"‘Slow death’: ten years confined to camps for 130,000 Rohingya in Myanmar",Analysis,BROUK,Protection and Human Rights,23 May 2022,"Genocidal acts continue as military junta defies provisional measures ordered by International Court of Justice, In its new briefing, the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK) provides evidence that the genocidal act known as ‘slow death’ continues to be perpetrated against the Rohingya by the military regime. This act of genocide involves deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction in whole or in part of the Rohingya group., More than two years have passed since the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Myanmar to ‘take all measures within its power’ to prevent irreparable harm against the Rohingya in its provisional measures order. The military regime is due to submit its new report to the ICJ on compliance with the provisional measures by Monday 23 May., June 2022 marks a decade since the State-orchestrated violence of 2012 that expelled tens of thousands of Rohingya from their homes in central Rakhine State, Myanmar. The violence against the Rohingya was planned and instigated by government officials and state security forces. It included indiscriminate extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, mass arbitrary arrests of Rohingya and torture at detention sites, the burning of homes, destruction of mosques and looting of shops., Rohingya displaced by the violence in central Rakhine State were segregated and confined to camps, in violation of international law. More than 130,000 members of the Rohingya group, over half of whom are children, continue to be confined indefinitely in camps under squalid conditions. They have been subjected to the deliberate deprivation of resources indispensable for survival – namely adequate food, water, shelter, sanitation and medical care - by the military authorities. They have endured a decade of such ‘slow death’ treatment and for a generation of Rohingya children it is the only life they have ever known., “Instead of using bullets and machetes the military are using malnutrition, denial of access to healthcare, and other basic essentials of life to continue the genocide of the Rohingya,” said Tun Khin, President of Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK. “The military are ignoring the provisional measures order and the international community. Yet again the military are being allowed get away with human rights violations against the Rohingya which amount to atrocity crimes. Countries which claim to support the genocide case are taking no practical action to ensure the provisional measures are followed and the genocide of the Rohingya is stopped.”, As documented by BROUK, such conditions of life have led to the preventable deaths of women and children in the past two years since the provisional measures were ordered. Rohingya continue to be subject to many other severe human rights violations including deaths, beatings, torture, arbitrary arrests, restrictions on movement and more., The ICJ has ignored requests from the Rohingya community to make public reports submitted to the Court by the former democratic government and now the military junta on compliance with the provisional measures., “We are being denied the right to know what the military regime – the perpetrators of genocide against us - are telling the Court. The international community seems to be sitting back and watching the ICJ case waiting for the outcome, but the court ordered provisional measures because the genocide is ongoing and needs action to prevent it now,” said Tun Khin. “There is no question that the military are ignoring the provisional measures. The question is whether the UN Security Council and countries like the USA, UK and France are going to do anything about it, or sit back and do nothing like they did in the run up to the military offensives in 2016 and 2017 which led to the mass killings of our people.”, The full briefing is available here: https://www.brouk.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ICJ-Briefing-May-2022.pdf, For more information, please contact Tun Khin on +44 7888714866.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/slow-death-ten-years-confined-camps-130000-rohingya-myanmar
Myanmar: Japan-Trained Officer Among Abusive Forces,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,22 May 2022,"Tokyo Should Cut Military Ties, Pressure Junta to End Atrocities, (Tokyo) – A Myanmar air force lieutenant colonel who received military training in Japan is deployed with forces that have been implicated in serious abuses in Myanmar’s central Magway Region, Human Rights Watch and Justice For Myanmar said today. The Japanese government should immediately halt its training program and investigate whether other program participants are involved in operations involving laws-of-war violations., Myanmar Air Force Lt. Col. Hlwan Moe received training at Japan’s Air Command and Staff College from August 2016 to March 2017, according to the All Japan Defense Association and a defense ministry document. A media outlet reported that Hlwan Moe is a deputy commander, and two well-connected sources said he is based at Magway Air Base. Heavy fighting in the Magway Region since the February 2021 coup, including armed clashes and airstrikes, has displaced over 50,000 civilians. The Myanmar military has committed summary executions, arson, and other abuses, including possible indiscriminate airstrikes in Magway, media have reported., “The Myanmar military’s long history of committing war crimes with impunity should have been enough evidence for Japan that its military training program was going to risk making Japan complicit in atrocities,” said Teppei Kasai, Asia program officer at Human Rights Watch. “The Japanese government should give up its absurd, wishful thinking that its training program can change the Myanmar military’s abusive culture.”, Hlwan Moe’s name, rank, position, and military ID 2321 are identified in a list of Myanmar air force personnel reportedly involved in airstrikes since 2021 that was leaked to Khit Thit Media, a Myanmar media group that published it in January 2022. Two sources with connections to Myanmar military personnel, who reviewed Hlwan Moe’s photograph, confirmed his name, military ID and rank., Since 2015, the Japanese government has accepted cadets and officers from Myanmar under article 100 of the Self-Defense Forces Act, which permits training and educating foreign nationals in Defense Ministry facilities with the defense minister’s approval. In 2021, following the coup, Japan accepted two cadets and two officers. In 2022, Japan again accepted two cadets and two officers for training., Human Rights Watch in December 2021 called on the Japanese government to immediately suspend the training program because it risks making Japan complicit in military atrocities. At the time, a Japanese Defense Ministry official replied that the ministry did not have any information about what the cadets and officers trained in Japan were doing once back in Myanmar., During a parliamentary committee session on security on April 26, 2022, however, a Defense Ministry official said the defense ministry “knows to a certain extent” what “positions” they currently hold, but declined to disclose any details due to Japan’s “relationship” with “the other country.” For decades, the Myanmar military has been responsible for war crimes in long-running armed conflicts with ethnic armed groups, and crimes against humanity and acts of genocide against ethnic Rohingya in Rakhine State., Since the February 2021 coup, junta security forces have carried out serious abuses including mass killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and indiscriminate attacks on civilians that amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes. The security forces have killed over 1,800 people, including at least 130 children, and arbitrarily arrested over 13,000, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. The military has expanded abusive operations in ethnic minority areas and against anti-junta armed groups, displacing more than 550,000 people, while deliberately blocking aid to populations in need as a form of collective punishment., The military has carried out targeted and indiscriminate attacks on civilians, including airstrikes and heavy artillery barrages, causing loss of life and property. Accounts from displaced people and aid workers suggest that the junta has continued to use the military’s longstanding “four cuts” strategy, in which the armed forces maintain control of an area by isolating and terrorizing the civilian population. The United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, in his February report on government weapons sales to the Myanmar military, said that jet aircraft, attack helicopters, armored vehicles, light and heavy artillery, missiles, and rockets were being used against civilians., Since the coup, the Japanese government has called for a restoration of democratic rule and the release of elected government officials, including Aung San Suu Kyi. On March 28, 2021, Japan’s Defense Ministry issued a joint statement with 11 other countries criticizing the military’s attacks against “unarmed civilians.” The Japanese government halted new non-humanitarian Official Development Assistance (ODA) projects earlier in 2021 while allowing existing aid projects to continue. The Japanese Diet passed a resolution in June that condemned the coup and called for a “swift restoration of the democratic political system.”, “It is inexcusable for Japan to continue to train cadets from the Myanmar military, knowing that it commits atrocity crimes,” said Yadanar Maung, spokesperson for Justice For Myanmar. “Japan’s cadet training program emboldens the junta and provides support to military personnel that may be used in the commission of crimes against the people of Myanmar. We call on the Japanese government to immediately halt these trainings and take concrete steps to stop the Myanmar military from committing grave violations, including ending business with the Myanmar military and its conglomerates.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-japan-trained-officer-among-abusive-forces

They used the main road in the village when they left, and they fired around seven to eight rounds of gunfire when they reached the bridge at the entrance of the village [before leaving the village]. At 10:00 pm on March 27th 2022, they entered the village again and fired guns in the village. On March 28th 2022, they came into the village at around 8:00 or 9:00 pm and questioned villagers. The firing of both big and small weapons could be heard at the entrance of the village, as they were leaving. Since the SAC have repeatedly fired guns in the village, villagers are now very afraid and they feel that there is a lack of security for them as they always have to live in fear. Also, no one knew the purpose and reason behind these actions., On April 15th 2022, more than 10 SAC soldiers from an unidentified unit came into A--- village again. They carried weapons with them when they came. These soldiers were in the village for a while and then left at around 8:00 or 9:00 am. However, when they left, they did not return to the place that they came from. They were patrolling outside the village, entered villagers’ huts [located outside of the village] and rummaged around the huts. After they finished searching the villagers’ huts, they came back to the village again at around 11:00 am [on April 15th, the same day]. The morning that they came back to the village [the second time that day], there was a communion in an Anglican church, and people attending the church were afraid because of the presence of SAC soldiers outside the church., On April 14th 2022, a da lan [an informant or spy] who lived in a Burmese [Bamar] village near A--- village was shot. As a result, on April 16th 2022, SAC soldiers returned to A--- village again because they heard that there were members of the People’s Defence Force (PDF)[4] in the village. Upon arriving, they entered a villager’s house, and one of the soldiers pointed his gun at a man who was in a hammock. However, the soldiers finally left the house because that man didn’t do anything [was not found to have any connection with the PDF]. Since the SAC soldiers came and conducted investigations in the village, school teachers from the village who participated in the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM)[5] are afraid and worried. Villagers also no longer dare to stay in their huts [outside the village]., Further background reading on the situation of SAC activities in Taw Oo District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in March and April 2022. It was provided by a community member in Taw Oo District who has been trained by KHRG to monitor human rights conditions on the ground. The names of the victims, their photos and the exact locations are censored for security reasons. The parts in square brackets are explanations added by KHRG., [2] The State Administration Council (SAC) is the executive governing body created in the aftermath of the February 1st 2021 military coup. It was established by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on February 2nd 2021, and is composed of eight military officers and eight civilians. The chairperson serves as the de facto head of government of Burma/Myanmar and leads the Military Cabinet of Myanmar, the executive branch of the government. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of SAC chairperson following the coup., [3] A village tract is an administrative unit of between five and 20 villages in a local area, often centred on a large village., [4] The People’s Defence Force (PDF) is an armed resistance established independently as local civilian militias operating across the country. Following the February 1st 2021 military coup and the ongoing brutal violence enacted by the junta, the majority of these groups began working with the National Unity Government (NUG), a body claiming to be the legitimate government of Burma/Myanmar, which then formalized the PDF on May 5th 2021as a precursor to a federal army., [5] On February 2nd 2021, healthcare workers at state-run hospitals and medical facilities across Burma/Myanmar spearheaded what is being referred to as a Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) consisting of labour strikes in protest against the February 1st 2021 military coup. The movement quickly spread to include civil servants from all sectors of the government who are walking off their jobs as a way of non-recognition and non-participation in the military regime. Because of the popularity of the movement, and its seminal role in wider protests across the country, some people have begun using it as a catch-all phrase to include other protest forms like boycotts and pot-banging.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/taw-oo-district-short-update-sac-activities-march-april-2022

Monitoring the Agri-food System in Myanmar 2022 - Agricultural Crop Traders – March 2022 survey,Assessment,IFPRI,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",19 May 2022,"To understand the effects of COVID-19 and political instability on Myanmar’s crop trade sector, a phone survey of commodity traders was conducted in March 2022 with an expanded sample of 456 traders in 14 states and regions., Key Findings, • More than 90 percent of traders reported increased transport costs, up by 74 percent on average over the past year, driven by fuel price increases of 168 percent. Transport cost increases were aggravated by curfews and check points related to the security situation. As a consequence, 30 percent of traders experienced difficulty contracting transport services., • Compared to the same period last year farm prices have increased for maize (78 percent), pulses (41 percent to 55 percent) and oilseeds (27 percent to 32 percent) due to export demand and depreciation of the Myanmar Kyat. This will provide incentives to farmers in the Dry Zone and Hilly/Mountainous areas. Paddy prices at the end of March have increased by a lesser amount (23 percent), not enough to offset increases in the cost of chemical fertilizer (expected to rise by 50 percent in the coming monsoon season) and mechanization services., • Higher farmgate prices combined with modestly increased trading volumes imply greater working capital requirements for traders. Only a small proportion have increased their lending balance sheets given uncertainty about length of time for repayment., Looking Ahead, • Consumer prices will continue to rise steeply due to higher farm gate prices and transportation costs. Vegetable oil prices will be very high due to the combination of the Ukraine conflict and the Indonesian palm oil export ban. Increases in chickpea prices limit the options for poor consumers to maintain protein consumption by substituting away from meat and eggs to pulses. The majority of Myanmar households are now vulnerable to protein deficiency and the majority of children to Vitamin A deficiency., • The March 2022 survey round took place before the new foreign exchange restrictions were implemented, requiring exporters to convert all foreign exchange earnings into Myanmar Kyat within 24 hours at the official rate. The difference between the official and parallel market rate is effectively an export tax that will be passed on to farmers, reducing their profitability. This can be avoided by allowing agricultural exporters to maintain foreign currency accounts.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/monitoring-agri-food-system-myanmar-2022-agricultural-crop-traders-march-2022-survey
Monitoring the Agri-food System in Myanmar 2022 - Food Vendors – March 2022,Assessment,IFPRI,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",19 May 2022,"Key findings, Based on a survey of 422 food vendors in rural and urban areas and in all state/regions of Myanmar in March 2022, it is found that:, Over the last year (comparing March 2022 to March 2021), (nominal) food costs have increased by 41 percent overall and by 39 and 42 percent in urban and rural areas, respectively. Nominal price increases for most foods range from 30 to 50 percent, including protein and micronutrient rich foods., Rice prices have increased the least of any reported food over the last year. However, a 23 percent increase in this primary staple, which accounts for about 60 percent of caloric intake and 20 percent of household food expenditure, is concerning., The majority of vendors report challenges related to inputs including high prices of raw materials or supplies (78 percent), high fuel or transportation costs (81 percent), and disrupted access to energy/electricity (57 percent). In the three months before the survey, 62 percent of vendors report one of these challenges as their single greatest adversities., More than a third of vendors considered either restrictions on mobility (26 percent) or insecurity (10 percent) to have been the greatest obstacles, in the past month.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/monitoring-agri-food-system-myanmar-2022-food-vendors-march-2022
ACLED Regional Overview - East Asia Pacific (7 - 13 May 2022),Analysis,ACLED,Protection and Human Rights,19 May 2022,"Last week in the East Asia Pacific region, fighting continued between the Myanmar military and local resistance groups in Myanmar. North Korea conducted two missile tests. In the Philippines, Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos, Jr. and Sara Duterte won the national elections as president and vice-president, respectively, amid a surge in political violence and demonstrations related to the elections. In Indonesia, there were armed clashes between the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) and state forces, while ethnic Papuans continued to demonstrate against the proposed creation of new provinces in Papua. In Papua New Guinea, Nomali and Aiyala clans in Enga province engaged in a shootout. In China, riots in response to stringent COVID-19 lockdowns continued in Shanghai. In Thailand, pro-democracy demonstrations continued in Bangkok. In Australia, health workers demonstrated in Western Australia and Queensland., In Myanmar, fighting continued between the Myanmar military and local resistance groups. On 12 May in southern Shan state, the military and the Pa-Oh National Organization/Pa-Oh National Army (PNO/PNA) suffered casualties when combined forces of the Southern Shan Revolution Youth (SSRY), Karenni Nationalities Defense Force (KNDF), Pekon People’s Defense Force, and Inle People’s Defense Force attacked their outpost in Hti Ri village, Nyaungshwe township. The PNO/PNA signed a ceasefire agreement with the military in 1991 and has been criticized by Pa-Oh ethnic youth groups for fighting alongside the military after the coup (Myanmar Now, 13 May 2022). While the military conducted airstrikes during the clash, the combined forces captured five soldiers, including three PNO/PNA members, and seized their weapons. Violence in Shan-South is both common and highly volatile; it is considered an area of ‘extreme risk’ by ACLED’s Volatility and Predictability Index., In northern Shan state, fighting between the Myanmar military and ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) intensified across multiple townships. On 8 May, the military clashed with the Myanmar National Truth and Justice Party/Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNTJP/MNDAA) in three separate townships. In Hseni township, the military fought against the Northern Alliance (NA-B), which includes the MNTJP/MNDAA. In Mabein township, they fought combined forces of the MNTJP/MNDAA, Palaung State Liberation Front/Ta’ang National Liberation Army (PSLF/TNLA), and an unreported local defense group, and in eastern Kutkai township, they fought the MNTJP/MNDAA on its own. The Kachin Independence Organization/Kachin Independence Army (KIO/KIA) also clashed with the military on 12 May, with military soldiers based in Kutkai town firing artillery rounds., Meanwhile, the military and police tightened security in many states and regions last week. Several civilians in Yangon and Magway regions were arrested for anti-coup social media posts and claims they had connections with or were supporting People’s Defense Forces (PDFs). In Sagaing region, military troops raided Mon Taing Pin village in Ye-U township and arrested nearly three dozen civilians, including monks and young novices, beating them to death and burning their bodies between 10 and 13 May (Radio Free Asia, 17 May 2022)., North Korea conducted its 15th and 16th test missile launches in 2022 last week. On 7 May, a suspected submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) was test-fired from waters around Sinpho City in South Hamgyong province towards the ocean off the country’s east coast (Channel News Asia, 7 May 2022). On 12 May, three short-range ballistic missiles were test-fired from Sunan of Pyongyang, also toward the ocean off the country’s eastern coast (AP, 13 May 2022). This came amid the 10 May inauguration of the new South Korean president, Yoon Suk-yeol. Experts say the missile tests intend to send a message to South Korea’s new conservative administration and to strengthen North Korea’s internal solidarity as Pyongyang officially confirmed the first case of COVID-19 just hours before the launch (VOA, 12 May 2022)., In the Philippines, the general election was held on 9 May. Filipino voters overwhelmingly chose to support the candidates aligned with outgoing President Rodrigo Duterte, presidential candidate Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos, Jr., the son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, and vice-presidential candidate Sara Duterte, Rodrigo Duterte’s daughter (Rappler, 2022). The two gained decisive victories over their closest challengers. Marcos’s election represents a remarkable political rehabilitation for the Marcos family, who were driven to exile in 1986 after the elder Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt. Meanwhile, the incoming administration has indicated to provide legal cover from international prosecution for the outgoing president (Inquirer, 27 January 2022), who is facing an investigation into crimes against humanity before the International Criminal Court in relation to his government’s war on drugs (*for more, see this ACLED *report on the drug war in the Philippines)., The elections triggered a surge in political violence in the Philippines, with increasing attacks and armed clashes largely involving supporters of rival local politicians. Attacks on voters, poll workers, candidates, or candidates’ families, and looting of vote-counting machines or ballots were reported, as well as numerous casualties. This violence contributed to the 165% increase in violence in the Philippines last week relative to the past month flagged by ACLED’s Conflict Change Map, which first warned of increased violence to come in the country in the past month., Meanwhile, Marcos’s and Duterte’s election triggered large demonstrations in major cities across the country (Philippine Daily Inquirer, 11 May 2022). The demonstrators also accuse the Commission on Elections (Comelec) of alleged incompetence, after problems affecting voting on election day, such as malfunctioning vote-counting machines (Manila Bulletin, 9 May 2022)., In Indonesia, the TPNPB shot a truck driver dead in Wako village, Gome district, Puncak regency, Papua province, on 11 May (Antara News, 11 May 2022). Two days later, the rebels fired shots at a commercial airplane in Ilaga district in the same regency during the evacuation of the truck driver (JPNN, 13 May 2022). ACLED’s Conflict Change Map first warned of increased violence to come in Indonesia in the past month., Meanwhile, there was an increase in nationwide demonstrations by ethnic Papuans against the proposed creation of new provinces in Papua. Demonstrators also demand a referendum on Papua’s independence. In Jayapura, a demonstration turned violent, as ethnic Papuans threw rocks and engaged in scuffles. Police responded by firing water cannons and teargas (Kompas, 11 May 2022)., Meanwhile, ACLED’s Emerging Actor Tracker flagged several emerging communal militia groups in **Papua New Guinea **over the past month that have engaged in civilian targeting, including Engan ethnic militia, Nomali clan militia, and Aiyala clan militia. This is largely attributable to the recent fights between local clans in Enga province during 4 – 7 May, which caused 17 deaths and burned down dozens of houses (Post Courier, 9 May 2022). The presence of emerging actors indicates a change in the conflict environment, with civilians often bearing the burden of such new activity., In China, riots continued in Shanghai last week amid China’s stringent COVID-19 lockdown. Residents under stay-at-home orders clashed with government lockdown enforcers wearing white hazmat suits, called the ‘Big White’ army (Bloomberg, 26 April 2022). Some rioters were pinned to the ground during a clash in Minhang district in Shanghai on 7 May (Deutsche Welle, 9 May 2022). Violence in Shanghai has become increasingly volatile, resulting in a shift from a place of ‘low risk’ to being considered an area of ‘growing risk’ by ACLED’s Volatility and Risk Predictability Index., In Thailand, demonstrations demanding the release of detained pro-democracy demonstrators were held last week in Bangkok. The demonstrators stood still for one hour and 12 minutes, symbolizing the lèse-majesté law, Article 112 – a criminal act that prohibits defamation of the monarch of Thailand (The Diplomat, 7 March 2022). Demonstrations calling for release of political activists on bail saw a slight uptick last week as several pro-democracy activists’ cases have been denied bail in court (UCA News, 17 May 2022). Meanwhile, members of Thalugaz, People’s Party, and United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship organized a rally in Bangkok on 13 May, marking the 12th anniversary of the death of Major General Khattiya Sawasdipol, who was shot dead during a Red Shirt protest in 2010 (Prachatai 13 May 2022)., In Australia, health workers took strike action and held demonstrations organized by the United Workers Union (UWU) across Western Australia and Queensland last week, while marking International Nurses Day on 12 May. Hundreds of health workers marched through Perth and Brisbane on 10 and 11 May, calling for higher wages and better working conditions (ABC News, 10 May 2022). Aged care workers demonstrated in solidarity in Adelaide and Launceston. Meanwhile, hundreds of National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) members held demonstrations in Sydney, demanding wage increases and improved job security (Solidarity, 13 May 2022). As Australia’s federal election is scheduled for 21 May, labor demonstrations have erupted since the May Day rally that began on 30 April against government labor policies and calling for changes in the upcoming election.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/acled-regional-overview-east-asia-pacific-7-13-may-2022

"Dooplaya District Interview: The SAC’s indiscriminate shelling killed a 17-year-old girl and injured three other villagers, March 2022",Situation Report,KHRG,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",18 May 2022,"This interview describes events that occurred in Kaw T’Ree (Kawkareik) Township, Dooplaya District in March 2022. The SAC LIB #355 indiscriminately fired a mortar shell into Htee Moo Hta village, Noh Hpoh village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township, Dooplaya District on March 24th 2022. A 17-year-old girl was hit in the head by a fragment of mortar and died immediately. Additionally, one male and two female villagers were injured by the indiscriminate shelling. Local villagers’ property was also damaged.[1], Interview | Htee Moo Hta village, Noh Hpoh village tract[2], Kaw T’Ree (Kawkareik) Township, Dooplaya District (March 2022), Name: Naw[3] E---
Gender: Female
Age: 47
Religion: Buddhist
Ethnicity: Karen
Family Status: N/A
Occupation: Health worker, Could you please start to explain what happened during the incident?
In the early morning [of March 24th 2022], there was gunfire at the Asia Highway [fighting broke out between the State Administrative Council (SAC)[4] and Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[5] on the highway between Kawkareik and Myawaddy towns]. I heard the sound of gunfire for just two or three minutes. We were getting ready to move out of [flee from] the house but just before we stood up, a mortar shell [fired by the SAC Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[6] #355] was already falling down on my home and [a fragment of exploded shell] hit my niece. I did not even reach [manage to get] underground [to hide in the bunker]., What is the distance between the Asia Highway and your place?
The distance from my village to the highway is only about two or three miles [3.2 to 4.8 kilometres]., So, did they literally fire into the village or did the fighting happen in the [surrounding] area?
Yes, the fighting happened [between the SAC and KNLA] by the side of the Asia Highway [outside of the village]. After the fighting broke out, the brutal Burma [SAC] soldiers fired [a mortar shell] into the village., What time was it?
It was early morning, just past about 5:00 am. She [the victim] had already cooked a rice meal by that time [normally consisting of rice with curry or soup]. After she cooked [her meal], she put the dirty plates in the washing place. Just as she went to put the plates [in the washing place], the shelling immediately fell and [a fragment] hit her. [The plan was,] once she put the plates away, we would go underground [to hide in the bunker]., Did anyone go underground [to the bunker under their house]?
We hadn’t gone down yet. Our neighbours around here were about to go and hide in the bunker because of the gunfire. It [the gunfire] was heard [by the villagers] for just a moment, but it was not for long [so they did not make it to the bunker]., How many people were inside the house during the gunfire?
During the gunfire, only two of us, my niece and I, were inside the house. As I do not have a husband, I adopted one of my nieces. So I consider her my child because she is my older brother’s child. I have looked after her since she was very little and I supported her in school until high school Standard [Grade] Ten. Due to the unstable situation at school [school closures due to the coup and COVID-19], she came back to stay at home., How did the mortar shell hit her?
The fragment of mortar shell hit her directly on her head. When I looked at my niece, her skull was broken and her brain was falling out. How could I help her?, Were you by yourself when you saw her get hit and fall down?
Yes, I [was by myself when I] saw it all because it was just the two of us [in the house]. I immediately went to pick her up and hug her. As the shelling was still going on, our neighbours around us would not dare to come and help us. I was angry about that at first. I said to the other villagers that, “I was very helpful to you in the past. Even when you were sick and injured, I had to take you [to get treatment] and look after you at night. When the problem has turned to me, none of you even take a look at me”. A few minutes later, when the shelling stopped, two or three of the villagers came to [help] me., What is the name of your niece and how old is she?
Her name is Naw Bleh Cho. She is 17 years old. She was born in 2005., She is still very young.
Exactly, it has cost me a lot to support her at school. As it [the incident] happened so quickly, it has been unbearable for me. I do not feel normal yet when I think of her. Also, my house and my flowers and plants are very damaged. It will still cost a lot to repair the damage. The shelling fell on the roof, so the rooftop as well as the floors are all broken., What else is damaged?
The other damaged property includes the rooftop of my rice barn and one of my concrete water containers for bathing; it did not break the water container itself but the cement floor around is broken into pieces., Are there any other damages or casualties in the village?
Three other villagers were injured. They are U[7] N---, 45 years old and his wife, Naw L---, 38 years old. They are husband and wife. The other injured villager is Naw M---, aged 35 years old. Naw L--- got a minor injury to her lower calf but it was not severe. Her husband was injured in the stomach from the exploded fragment and fell down immediately, but the fragment did not go inside his belly. Naw M--- was hit in her waist and the shrapnel exited through her buttocks, Is their house close to yours?
Yes, their house is close to mine. Naw M---’s house is just on the other side of the road from my house. She was chopping firewood underneath the house [raised house] during the shelling., Where are they undergoing treatment now?
We did not know where to transfer Naw M----, so we just took her to the public hospital at Thingannyinaung Town. For the husband and wife [U N--- and Naw L---], they were not severely injured so they just underwent treatment in the village [from a health worker] and then came back to stay at their house., Has Naw M--- been discharged from hospital?
She has not been discharged yet as her condition is very severe. She might have to stay there for more than 10 days., Who took her to hospital?
Just the villagers from here, Htee Moo Hta village., After she was hit [by the fragment of mortar], was she still conscious?
She, the woman who was transferred to the hospital, was still conscious after she was hit. But she felt dizzy and did not dare to look around. She was not unconscious., Did anyone provide support to pay for the expenses for the treatment [of all the injured villagers]?
I do not know anything about that. They have to pay for everything by themselves. For my niece, one of the KNLA officials provided a donation of over 300,000 kyats [USD 162.03][8]. I do not remember his name., Do you know which armed group fired the mortar shell?
It might be the Burma soldiers [KHRG’s researcher confirmed that it was SAC LIB #355]. I do not think that the Karen [KNLA] soldiers have that type of artillery., After the incident happened [the shelling], how did you arrange the funeral [for your niece]?
I kept her for one night at my house, and yesterday [March 27th 2022] we took her and buried her at a cemetery [according to Buddhist practices]., Were there any other damages due to the shelling?
The car of U N--- [one of the injured villagers] was damaged. The mirror of the car was hit by a fragment from the exploded mortar., So, how many mortar shells fell on your house?
One mortar shell fell on my house but exploded into many fragments. If two or three shells had fallen on us, we would have all died. Even though just one fell, the fragments injured people horribly., It was only one shell [that was fired into the village]?
Yes, it was just one. U N--- and his three or four children [who were at home with him at the time] were shielded by the bathroom. If the bathroom had not been there, it would be terrible to imagine. I have to thank God for the protection., Are there any authorities from armed groups or the village head who have come to provide support and look after you?
I do not see such things., Did they [the SAC] give any warning before firing the mortar?
We had heard from the village head that they [SAC soldiers] said, “If anyone fights against us, we will fire mortars into the village.” So they [village authorities] warned us to be cautious when staying in the village., After the incident happened, did any of the Burma [SAC] soldiers enter to check the situation in the village?
No, they did not come., How would you like to express your feelings on this incident?
If I have to say something about it. It gravely affects my life. You can imagine that I supported my niece in attending school so that she would become an educated person. I am not a wealthy person so I have had to try very hard for her to get a chance to attend school. To get an education today, the priority is money. I am not rich because I just farm and sell rice. Then, I sent my niece to school with the income that I get from farming. I supported my niece from Standard [Grade] Five until Ten. The [school] expenses cost a lot., How much do you think it would cost if you have to repair all the damaged materials in your home?
Umm, nowadays, everything is valuable and expensive. The zinc roofing of my barn alone already cost over 100,000 kyats [USD 54.01]. If I have to repair all the damaged materials, I think it would cost up to 1,000,000 kyats [USD 540.10] or much more., How do you feel about this incident?
It put us in a state of fear and anxiety. The villagers are more concerned for their security because of the shelling into our village. As there are many villagers here, someone will [undoubtedly] be hit if a mortar falls into the village. If they [the SAC] still continue activities like this in the future, it would cause a lot of suffering to the villagers. They do not tell us when they will start fighting. Sometimes, we are in bed at night [when they start fighting]. How can you stay alert to the shelling while you are sleeping? That’s why. There will be much more difficulty if the situation continues like this., How do most villagers here secure their livelihood?
My village is in a mountainous area close to [Myawaddy] town. Most villagers farm (work on hill farms or plantations). Villagers will not go to Bangkok or move to another village to find other work. We just stay in our own homes., What do you do to earn a livelihood?
For me, I just farm and serve as a health worker with my experience and knowledge from attending a medical training offered by the Myanmar government [prior to the coup]., What would you like to tell the local authorities including the village head and soldiers, about taking action and responsibility?
I do not want to put more of a burden on them [local authorities]. Even if they take action [against armed groups] for the situation today, such situations can [are likely to] keep happening in the future. If it continues like this, the village leaders will have more concerns. That’s why I do not want to put a burden on them. I also work for the community. I have been working as a medic for over 20 years. I know everything about the villagers’ concerns, from my experience [as a health worker]., How has this incident impacted the villagers’ movements outside the village? Are they afraid to go out?
The night after the shelling, the village head called a meeting about whether the villagers wanted to move out [displace] or not. But how can the villagers move if they do not have [cannot bring] food supplies with them? Healthcare is also important because there are a lot of elders and children in the village. So the villagers responded to him by saying that they would not move. We will just stay like this until we die. We will just carry on with our livelihoods and stay [in the village] as long as we can., Is it also hard to move?
Yes, it is extremely hard to move. Where can we move to in the [local] area? Even if we move to the mountains, we will have to bring our food with us and then the weather is also unstable. If the medicine supplies are not sufficient for healthcare, especially for children and elders, you cannot hide in the mountains, can you? That’s why if we move, we will suffer more., What are the other villagers’ perspectives about this incident?
Regarding the shelling, some of the villagers also feel angry because the people who fight are soldiers, but the shelling affects the villagers. This upsets them. The Karen soldiers fight against Burma [SAC] soldiers. If the Burma [SAC] soldiers were humane, they might fight the soldiers directly. Instead, they oppress the villagers by shelling into the village, so villagers are affected the most., What will you do with your life now?
I am not sure about the rest of my life as I am growing old. I will just continue to do my work as much as I can., What else do you want to express or share?
With today’s situation on my mind, I do not want such things like shelling into our village to affect us. If possible, we also do not want to see our villagers injured like this. But we cannot prevent the activities of soldiers, can we? As we cannot prevent [military activity], we just have to suffer when it happens. It is very bad to be a civilian. If the authorities [any of the authorities, whether the SAC or ethnic armed groups] do not permit travelling, we cannot do anything and we just have to stay under the control of the authorities., Right now, do the villagers feel secure to travel?
We do go to buy things from Thingannyinaung Town, but if the sun is rising higher [it is during the day] we have to travel with caution., Are there any soldiers who check you when you travel along your way?
There has been no checking so far. It is only three miles to Thingannyinaung Town. It is quick to reach there. The villagers do not go further than that. They just shop there for a bit and come back., Previously, where did you usually shop?
We used to buy [products] from Ra M’Tee [Myawaddy] and Kaw T’Ree [Kawkareik] towns before. If the villagers wanted to buy products from Myanmar they went to Kaw T’Ree Town, while some purchased products from Thailand from Ra M’Tee Town. Due to the unstable situation today, prices are getting higher and higher. Villagers are struggling the most with this situation., In your village, are there any bunkers that you have made for hiding?
Yes, some villagers have made them recently but some of the bunkers were dug a long time ago and have now been fixed., Did you recently make a bunker for hiding?
Yes, we made a bunker at the beginning of 2022 when we heard about the incident [airstrikes and attacks] in Lay Kay Kaw Town.[9], Has almost every individual made a bunker?
Yes, almost everyone has made a bunker. But some, two or three families, share the same bunker. Currently, some villagers do not even dare to sleep inside their house at night. They just sleep at the entrance of the bunker., Are people still sleeping in the bunker since the recent shelling?
Yes. [However,] after the incident [shelling on March 24th], there has not been anymore shelling into the village. Even when there was shelling, it landed outside of the village. So the situation is a bit better than before., Further background reading on the situation of fighting and indiscriminate shelling Dooplaya District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in March 2022.

WFP in Myanmar continues to provide urgent food and nutrition assistance to reduce the impact of rising food insecurity,News and Press Release,WFP,Food and Nutrition,16 May 2022,"Link to video, Providing a daily meal for a family of 10 is a daunting task for Ma Khine who lives in an impoverished neighborhood in the outskirts of Yangon city. With six children and four adults, including a disabled family member, the household requires almost 4 kilos of rice per day. The family of 10 rely on the oldest son who earns 8,000 Kyat a day – equal to or less than 5 USD – and this money is then managed by Ma Khine to provide for the entire family. With the rising prices of basic food items across the country, and the lack of financial income within the family, borrowing money just to buy essential food items has become an unfortunate practice for Ma Khine., “As the price for food and other essential items continue to rise, we have no choice but to borrow money on difficult days. Most days, we cannot pay back the loan and this leads to an increase in the the interest. And when we cannot settle the interest, it adds to the principal”, explained Ma Khine, who is the head of the household., The situation for Ma Khine’s family mirrors that of many in the Yangon Region where the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) is providing urgent food and nutrition assistance to reduce the impact of rising food insecurity. The concurrent health and political crises have also had a devastating effect, previously unseen in urban and peri urban areas of Yangon and Mandalay., The right to food is a human right and everyone deserves the right to adequate food and the right to be free from hunger. Therefore, with the support of donors, including Australia, Denmark, Italy, Israel, Japan, Republic of Korea, Sweden, and other private donors, WFP has reached 1.7 million people from across Yangon and Mandalay, many of whom share similar stories like Ma Khine., WFP’s assistance also extends to children, and the team on the ground has delivered Ready-to-Use Supplementary Food (RUSF) to more than 46,900 children aged 6-59 months, living in four townships in Yangon’s peri-urban area. These food deliveries help prevent acute malnutrition and are part of WFP’s Blanket Supplementary Feeding Programme (BSFP)., This nutrition support aims to immediately offset the risk of malnutrition among children as they receive reduced meals or less nutritious food affected by the increased food insecurity., Vulnerable children under the age of 5 are provided with a monthly ration of RUSF containing 15 sachets. One RUSF sachet is consumed every other day and is primarily for children. The supplementary food is eaten directly from the sachet without the need to dilute, mix or cook., WFP remains committed to support people of Myanmar as they face high burdens of increasing food insecurity and malnutrition.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/wfp-myanmar-continues-provide-urgent-food-and-nutrition-assistance-reduce-impact-rising-food-insecurity

Water Sanitation Hygiene",12 May 2022,"OVERVIEW, The people of Myanmar continue to face an unprecedented political, human rights, health and humanitarian crisis that is posing grave protection risks for civilians, limiting access to services and driving deeper food insecurity. Despite the ongoing access challenges, humanitarian partners have continued to rapidly scale-up in response to new needs, reaching a total of 2.6 million people in the first quarter of 2022. This single-quarter figure is more than double the number of people reached in 2020 and almost as many people as were reached in the whole of 2021 (3 million). However, this support was not as deep or multi-sectoral as had been planned because of severe access result (2.2 million), but this assistance is heavily weighted towards urban areas (especially Yangon 1.6 million) where access is more straightforward. Expanding access to conflict-affected parts of the country remains a priority, especially to under-served areas of higher-than-anticipated displacement in the northwest and southeast., The number of IDPs steeply increased to a total of 907,500 (as of 4 April 2022), far beyond the HRP planning figure of 556,000. This includes 560,900 people displaced since the military takeover who have been unable to return home due to the intensity of fighting, protection risks and destruction of their homes and livelihoods. It is anticipated that most of these additional IDPs were already covered in the HRP under the ‘vulnerable people with humanitarian needs’ population group and this will be reconciled in the mid-year report. Partners have been able to reach 353,000 IDPs with assistance so far in 2022, although coverage in conflict affected areas, particularly in the northwest remains low., The HRP remains severely underfunded with only 4 per cent of requirements received by the end of Q1 according to FTS. Substantial carry-over funding from 2021 has underwritten many activities in the reporting period, allowing Food Security partners, in particular, to deliver beyond the new funding commitments received this year. Without additional funds in Q2 and beyond, humanitarian partners will have to prioritize lower-cost life-saving and critical activities that do not offer the required depth of relief or contribute to people’s overall well-being, dignified living standards, or chance of finding durable solutions. During Q1, inflation also further eroded coping capacities of people in need, while adding to the cost of delivering services. The international community and a growing network of local organizations stand ready to assist in 2022 but will require increased funding, improved access to affected people, and an end to bureaucratic issues with visas, MOUs and banking.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-response-plan-2022-quarter-one-dashboard-jan-mar-2022

Myanmar: ASEAN must kickstart stalled approach to human rights crisis at US summit,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,12 May 2022,"As leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) meet in the United States for a two-day summit, Amnesty International urges them to spotlight the violence and human rights violations in Myanmar., “The Five-Point Consensus is a failure and did not stop the Myanmar military from perpetrating more human rights violations against the Myanmar people following the 2021 military coup,” Emerlynne Gil, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Research, said., “The ASEAN must concede that the human rights violations in Myanmar have now become a regional concern. The Myanmar military’s violence against its own people has not only made people feel unsafe but it has also led to the deterioration of the country’s economy. Right now, thousands of people are fleeing or attempting to flee to neighboring countries like Thailand and Malaysia not only to seek safety, but also to find work and feed their families., “ASEAN Member States should formulate a more detailed blueprint to hold Myanmar’s military accountable for human rights violations and address urgent needs, including committing to non-refoulement of refugees fleeing violence, facilitating desperately needed humanitarian assistance, and adding their voices to calls for a global arms embargo. ASEAN Member States should also act bilaterally to achieve these goals if consensus within the bloc cannot be reached., “As host of the summit, the Biden administration should center discussions on the ongoing human rights violations in Myanmar and in the region more broadly. The regional trends we’ve seen in recent years – escalating repression, constraints on civil society, and intolerance for political dissent – are antithetical to the free and open Indo-Pacific to which the US government is purportedly committed to supporting and will never be realized if human rights are ignored.”, Background:, Almost all leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are expected to attend the 12-13 May summit in Washington, which will mark 45 years of US-ASEAN relations., Myanmar’s Min Aung Hlaing, who seized power in the 1 February, 2021 coup, was not invited as part of efforts to distance the bloc from the senior general, who has not implemented the Five-Point Consensus he agreed to in April 2021., The Consensus was mainly aimed at stopping the violence against protesters, supplying humanitarian aid, and increasing dialogue. Since it was adopted, the situation in Myanmar has further spiraled out of control. Since the start of this coup, Myanmar’s military has killed more than 1,800 people, according to one monitoring group, and detained more than 10,000., Armed resistance groups have also sprung up in response to the bloody crackdown, while peaceful protests, though much smaller than at the beginning of the coup, have continued despite grave risks., Myanmar’s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was ousted in the pre-dawn hours of the coup, has been hit with an array of bogus charges and convictions, as have many of her allies.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-asean-must-kickstart-stalled-approach-human-rights-crisis-us-summit

UNODC supporting community-based treatment for people who use drugs in Kachin IDP camps and surrounding communities,News and Press Release,UNODC,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",11 May 2022,"UNODC in Myanmar aims to prevent drug abuse, enhance access to community-based drug treatment & reintegration services, especially among vulnerable populations., ""My son wanted to stop using drug, but we did not know how to help him, but through the advice received at the Rebirth Rehabilitation Service Center my son is now healthy and has got a second chance to build back his life better and I am really thankful to the drug treatment and rehabilitation services in the community,"" said U Naw Tawng, a concerned father from Myitkyina, Kachin state., Stories like U Naw Tawng’s show the impact of illicit drug use on people especially in vulnerable communities such as IDP camps and surrounding areas in Myitkyina, where UNODC continued to deliver and support community based drug prevention, treatment and services for people suffering from drug addiction problems., Illicit drug use is having a significant impact on people's health and wellbeing, and negatively affects the long-term prospects for an eventual return of the expanding numbers of IDPs to their home areas. Aiming to minimize the adverse health and social consequences of drug abuse in Kachin state's IDP camps and surrounding areas, UNODC’s experts work directly with and mentor volunteers in IDP camps to ensure people who use drugs can access health-centered services within their community setting., Ze Hkawng, an ex-drug user from Mawhpawng Lhaovo camp, overcame drug addiction with the help of community-based drug treatment and services programme. He has been trained by UNODC and is volunteering at the programme now actively. While screening risky drug behavior, he said, ""I was happy when I heard about the community-based drug treatment and services initiated by UNODC because I did not know how to get help to stop using drugs. The programme helped me to rid myself of the addiction and I am now healthy and happy. I think many youths like me need help, so I hope this programme will help them just like it helped me."", Since October 2021, the program supported the referral of 30 clients to government, INGOs and NGOs run service centers based on the client’s needs such as methadone maintenance therapy, HIV testing, Hepatitiis screening, counselling services, as well as community based treatment and rehabilitation services in coordination and cooperation with relevant partners. To reach more people, UNODC has started to roll out hybrid online training of trainers to participants from local faith-based organizations, enabling them to pass on their knowledge on a community-based approach to drug dependence treatment and services to members of the community., With their new knowledge, they will be able to conduct training sessions such as the one organized by UNODC's field staff for volunteers (half of whom were female and have of whom were male) from IDP Camps in Myitkyina together with NGOs and faith-based organizations working on drug and health areas. The workshop improved the skills of the IDP camps volunteers to screen and refer people who use drugs to the community based services, while at the same time facilitating improved networking and coordination among services providers and the volunteers., Mrs. Hkawn Ra, a camp leader from Du Kahtawng camp, said that joining the workshops has provided them with information on the referral pathway for service delivery, not only in the camp but also to surrounding areas as well. Mr. Joseph, a camp leader from Manhkring IDP camp, agreed with Mrs. Khawn Ra and added that the training also provided urgently needed assistance to the volunteers in their camps who will assist with drug-related issues in the camp., The trainings are part of UNODC’s collaboration with NGOs and faith-based organizations working on drug prevention, treatment, harm reduction, drug rehabilitation and social reintegration services, aimed at strengthening capacities to provide community-based services in particular in IDP settings. In Kachin, the programme focuses on preventing drug use and addressing drug-related issues among people in IDP camps and surrounding communities in three selected area of Kachin state: Myitkyina, Waimaw and Mogaung., In line with international standards and a balanced approach to drug control as reflected in an outcome document during the 2016 UN General Assembly Special Session on the world drug problem, UNODC in Myanmar aims to prevent drug abuse, and enhance access to community-based drug treatment and reintegration services, especially among vulnerable populations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unodc-supporting-community-based-treatment-people-who-use-drugs-kachin-idp-camps-and

Note to Correspondents: Statement by the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Myanmar regarding the ASEAN Humanitarian Consultations,News and Press Release,UN,Protection and Human Rights,3 May 2022,"The United Nations Secretary-General's Special Envoy on Myanmar, Noeleen Heyzer, welcomes the convening of the Consultative Meeting on ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance to Myanmar on 6 May and strongly urges ASEAN leaders and donors to prioritise principled engagement with diverse local humanitarian networks to effectively deliver aid to all communities in need., Over the past few months, the Special Envoy has held extensive engagements with some of Myanmar’s civil society organisations and local humanitarian networks who have been at the frontline in addressing the widening crisis amid escalating violence and increasing displaced populations. These groups have called for unhindered and safe humanitarian access to facilitate delivery of assistance without discrimination. The key messages from local humanitarian networks are clear: there is a need for the utmost respect of international humanitarian law and humanitarian principles; urgently needed humanitarian aid must not be instrumentalised for political purposes; military infrastructure must not be legitimised through aid delivery; and there is a need not only for more donor funding but also for donor flexibility to support local humanitarian actors and networks with access to hard-to-reach conflict affected areas, including internally displaced people, border communities and civilians affected by conflict, including in urban areas., In Myanmar’s currently violent, unstable and insecure context, effective delivery of humanitarian aid requires firm commitment by all aid actors to adhere to international humanitarian law. Given the complexity of Myanmar’s conflict it is imperative that humanitarian assistance is delivered through a diverse range of channels, without discrimination or favour, and reaches the most vulnerable in every part of the country. Safe and unimpeded access for all aid actors is non-negotiable. It is imperative that we build strong, effective and equal partnerships with local and informal humanitarian networks, who have unique access, local knowledge and established trust on the ground, to support the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people, especially in the hardest-to-reach areas, including through cross border assistance., We must recognise the current conflict has a disproportionate impact on women and children. The Special Envoy's consultations with women community leaders have highlighted the urgent need for humanitarian support and protection for women and children, capacity building to address gender-based violence and stronger connection to regional and global women leaders. The Special Envoy urges the global community to give women a key role in any humanitarian consultation, as women can help identify the most vulnerable and help monitor effective delivery along humanitarian principles. Reflective of the Secretary-General's commitment to the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda, we must actively engage women to fully address the humanitarian and protection needs of the people and amplify their voices for a future federal democratic union of peace, stability and shared prosperity.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/note-correspondents-statement-secretary-general-s-special-envoy-myanmar-regarding

Protection and Human Rights",9 May 2022,"""Little Pyit Tine Htaung"" programme, Saw Wai Moe and Ruth Ayisi, Hlyan Htet, 6, keeps close to his mother these days and does not venture far. “I have friends, but my best friend is a dog from downstairs. We play every evening together,” says Hlyan Htet., Although Hlyan Htet’s innocent charm shines through, his mother, Hnin Hnin, says the events of the past two years have taken their toll on him. “I was having problems in my marriage, then the first wave of COVID-19 came, and then the current crisis unfolded, one after the other.”, The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted Hlyan Htet’s early education and socialization. At first, “Mommy taught me at home,” Hlyan Htet says. Fortunately, Hlyan Htet has access to the Internet and he is still excited by his lessons offered online via Zoom., “I also love drawing,” says Hlyan Htet., However, the distressing circumstances of last year’s events has had a huge impact on Hlyan Htet. “My son started having trouble controlling his emotions and became overly attached and clingy to me. He gets up with me, since he doesn’t want to be left alone in bed, and, even when I pray, he sits beside me,” recalls, Hnin Hnin., Hlyan Htet is not alone in his distress and behavioural response to these compounding situations. COVID-19 has left 12 million children out of school for over a year and the current crisis is further undermining their mental health and psychosocial well-being. Many have witnessed violence and attacks, and some have been victims, leaving them mentally, if not physically, scarred., In response, UNICEF and its partners have been expanding psychosocial services for children and young people. This includes individual counselling, peer-support groups for adolescents and young people, and a national mental health and psychosocial advice helpline for children which is available in several ethnic languages., In July 2021, Hlyan Htet started participating in one of the virtual psychosocial activities, Little Pyit Tine Htaungs, named after one of Myanmar’s traditional brightly coloured egg-shaped toys that always stand upright when thrown., Hnin Hnin found this service on the Facebook page of Metanoia, UNICEF partner and mental health services and resource centre in Yangon. One of Metanoia’s staff explains the process. First, virtual helpline operators register participants and explain the activities on offer. Children over the age of 7 fill in pre-assessment and post-assessment forms, or a caregiver fills in the forms on their behalf if the child is under the age of 7. The three-day sessions are adapted to three age groups: 4–12 years, 13–17 years and 18–29 years. The younger children “learn to understand emotions and empathy, respect and boundaries, and identity while doing arts and crafts activities,” says the Metanoia staff member, while the older age groups focus on “understanding reactions to crisis, practising stabilization techniques, promoting a sense of safety, maintaining hope, staying connected and strengthening efficacy to overcome crisis.”, After group sessions, participants are usually offered a counselling session. “We request parents to give them [their children] personal space during these sessions. We will then talk with parents, and sometimes we find it’s them who needs therapy, not their child,” says the Metanoia staff member., Hnin Hnin says, “It’s really great and I’ve been recommending it to everyone.” She says that single parents, like her, are struggling with raising children during these times of crisis., “This project definitely helped them and their children.”, Both Hlyan Htet and his mother also received individual therapy sessions from a counsellor. “He got close to the counsellor,’ says his mother. “He was even asking me about her since he dreamt of her.” After some sessions, “he has gained more control (over his emotions), except that he won’t let me disappear from his sight,” says Hnin Hnin.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-and-partners-expand-mental-health-services-children-and-young-people-enmy

Myanmar: Rebuilding lives in Rakhine,News and Press Release,ICRC,"Mine Action
Recovery and Reconstruction",9 May 2022,"A landmine explosion. Clashes. Homes destroyed., This is an all too familiar story in Myanmar, where many have lost their homes during clashes. Some have been unable to return to their villages for years., ""We faced many challenges before we came back to our village,"" says Aung Saw Tun from his home in Rakhine State in Myanmar. ""Being displaced, I am worried about where we will run for safety, as the risk of fighting remains."", Aung Saw Tun was among hundreds who were forced to flee their homes as clashes led to crackdowns and the destruction of civilian houses across central Myanmar in 2020., Now, he and his family have returned to their village. But starting life from scratch brings with it new challenges, how to earn a living being one among many., Being forcibly displaced can mean relying on the goodwill of relatives, other families or humanitarian assistance. But such assistance rarely provides long-term solutions. For those who want to return home, to rebuild or restart their lives, the decision is often tied to whether they will be able to support themselves financially., ""At the moment, we receive a subsidy and we run our own business,"" says Aung Saw Tun. ""If possible, I would like to open a small shop at home while raising chickens."", Aung Saw Tun and his family are part of an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) project that helps displaced communities returning home to support themselves by creating livelihood opportunities. The project engages with communities to identify the ways in which they can support themselves and then provides them with financial assistance through cash grants to get them started., With the money he received through the project, Aung Saw Tun started a business making and selling traditional bamboo hats, and is now looking to expand into selling chickens., About 90 families, or more than 400 people, across Pha Yar Paung and Taung Pauk villages of Rakhine's Kyauktaw Township were supported through the project in late 2021 and early 2022., ""I ran a pig farm in the past,"" says Hla Saw Khaing, who was also part of the cash grant project. ""Because of the conflict, I could not afford to raise pigs myself, but now it is possible."", As the primary carer for her mother, Hla Saw Khaing needs to work from home and has started raising pigs again from her yard., Hla Saw Khaing was forced to live in a displacement camp with her mother after her house was set on fire amidst clashes. ""When I came back home from the camp, I was very sad because there was nothing left in my house,"" she says. ""There was no food to eat. It was not good for our health. This was no place to live. I didn't even have 50 kyats left. It was very sad to lose everything."", Not everyone who is forcibly displaced ends up staying in a temporary camp for shelter. Some stay with friends, or in monasteries or churches. Others, like Aye Yoin Thar, find shelter with relatives., When Aye Yoin Thar first returned to her village a year ago, emergency assistance from aid organisations helped to some extent, but it was no substitute for a safe and sustainable source of income. ""We were unable to make ends meet,"" she says. ""So, I brought vegetables from my garden and sold them for four or five months, but I haven't been able to do that since I have been sick."", With the help of the ICRC, Aye Yoin Thar has been able to open a small grocery store, and already has plans to expand the family business., ""Before the fire, our family made dough and ran a tea shop,"" she says. ""We are thinking of doing the same again."", In Rakhine, following the waves of displacement caused by clashes in 2012, 2017 and 2019, some families who were displaced are slowly starting to return home. Often facing ongoing safety concerns as well as the challenges of rebuilding a life and thinking of the future, the decision is a difficult one. Above all else, returning home should be a decision solely for those who are displaced. Opportunities for a safe and sustainable future, with health and dignity, need to be minimum conditions., No matter whether families stay or return after a conflict, planning for the future is vital.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-rebuilding-lives-rakhine

As of 2 May 2022, there were an estimated 936,700 internally displaced persons (IDPs) across Myanmar including 590,100 newly displaced since 1 February 2021., In the South-East, the security situation continued to deteriorate with intensified armed clashes), including indiscriminate artillery shelling. Landmines continue to pose grave protection risks for civilians and restrict access to farmland, markets, hospitals and schools. In the South-East, the majority of IDPs are located in Kayah State (89,700), Kayin State (82,000), Shan State South (49,800), as well as in Mon State (18,000), Tanintharyi Region (9,100) and Bago Region (900)., In Kachin and Shan (North) states, there is increasing restriction of movement, including physical obstacles on some main roads as well as fear of arrest or detention. This in turn impacts access to basic services and livelihoods opportunities of displaced people. In Shan (North) State, while no new displacement has been reported, forced recruitment and landmines remained key protection issues for civilians., In the North-West, the situation remained tense with continued armed clashes, including aerial attacks, and reports of human rights violations. The main needs of IDPs are food, core relief items, healthcare and shelter. In Chin State, some displaced people came back to their place of origin to check their properties. They are however unable to return home permanently because of the presence of armed groups or because their homes have been destroyed. In the North-West, displacement figures remain high with 240,600 IDPs in Sagaing Region, 50,500 in Magway Region and 36,300 in Chin State, with very limited humanitarian access., In Rakhine State, while some return movements have been observed from Rakhine displacement sites as a result of conflict, mainly in Sittwe, Pauktaw, and Minbya townships, Rakhine IDPs continue to raise concerns related to their security. Their return is hindered by the presence of antipersonnel mines, lack of access to livelihoods and lack of reliable information for them to make informed and free decisions to return to their places of origin/choice., The Rohingya population continues to suffer serious limitations on their enjoyment of basic human rights, such as freedom of movement, education and healthcare.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-emergency-update-4-may-2022

The ongoing clashes and movement restrictions in the northwest are impeding access and delivery of humanitarian assistance., As of 25 April 2022, 578,200 people were displaced nationally since the 1 February 2021 military takeover., 9,084 children under the age of 7 and 1,007 pregnant women in peri-urban Yangon benefited from primary health care services through the “Bright Start: Mobile-based health microinsurance” pilot programme., Since the beginning of 2022, a total of 53,332 people, including 36,258 children, have accessed critical child protection services nationally through 28 partners. Services include access to mental health and psychosocial support, gender-based violence risk mitigation, prevention and response interventions as well as explosive ordnance risk education., Funding Overview and Partnerships, The UNICEF Myanmar Country Office is appealing for US$ 151.4 million to deliver humanitarian assistance to displaced populations across the country. The Myanmar Humanitarian Needs Overview estimates that a total of 14.4 million people are in need of assistance this year. In 2022, UNICEF received generous support from the governments of Japan,
Denmark and UN OCHA Global Humanitarian Thematic funding to support Child Protection, Water Sanitation and Hygiene, Education, Health and Nutrition programme and response. These funds will contribute to delivering services to affected populations. The UNICEF Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) currently has a funding gap of 82 per cent.
Without this funding, targeted populations especially children who need basic social services will not be able to receive assistance. UNICEF expresses its gratitude to all donors, private and public, for their contributions to supporting the children of Myanmar., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, The humanitarian situation in Myanmar continues to deteriorate with intense clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF), Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs) and the People’s Defence Forces (PDFs). Intensified clashes between MAF and PDFs were reported in the northwest and southeast region where MAF used heavy artillery, airstrikes, and torched and destroyed civilian properties. As of 25 April 2022, an estimated 578,200 people were internally displaced including more than 327,400 people in the northwest and 186,200 in the southeast, accounting for almost 89 per cent of the national displacement figures since the military takeover of 1 February 20211 . Increased use of landmines and explosive ordnance in conflict-affected areas has been reported. More than 8,200 houses and public places such as churches, monasteries and schools were destroyed or burned down, mainly in Sagaing (4,416), Magway (1,751), and Chin (1,071), Kayah (819)2 .
In the northwest region, frequent displacements of IDPs have been reported, as children and their families are struggling to escape the surge of conflict affecting the area. In Sagaing, one of the most affected regions, an estimated 240,600 people are in need of humanitarian assistance. However, numerous challenges are being faced such as the security risks posed by the escalation of conflict, the increased number of checkpoints, the travel restrictions and transportation of supplies, and the limited number of humanitarian partners, all factors severely hampering the humanitarian response capacity to reach the people in need.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-myanmar-humanitarian-situation-report-no-3-1-30-april-2022

PRAK Sokhonn underscored that it is imperative to ensure that humanitarian programmes in Myanmar have a long-lasting impact in addressing pressing humanitarian concerns faced by the affected communities. He also encouraged the procurement, delivery, and distribution of humanitarian relief items, including COVID-19 vaccines, to Myanmar to be carried out in a timely, effective, safe, and nondiscriminatory manner. He emphasized that access, safety, and security of all implementing parties, including the ASEAN Monitoring Team, have to be guaranteed., The Meeting also welcomed the much-needed high-level commitment from ASEAN and the United Nations in their joint response to the humanitarian situation in Myanmar and supported the effort to expand the AHA Centre’s Partners for long-term humanitarian assistance projects., The Meeting commended Cambodia for prioritizing the humanitarian efforts in Myanmar on Cambodia’s agenda during ASEAN Chairmanship this year. The Meeting looked forward to more progress in the ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance to Myanmar framework based on the spirit of “One ASEAN, One Response” that would complement the implementation of the 5PC., Phnom Penh, 06 May 2022",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/press-release-outcomes-consultative-meeting-asean-humanitarian-assistance-myanmar-6

Shelter and Non-Food Items",5 May 2022,"The volatile situation in Myanmar following the 01 February 2021 coup has increased armed conflict and subsequent population displacement both within the country and across borders, including in Thailand., Since 17 March, 2,655 Myanmar refugees have crossed into Thailand, according to the Royal Thai Government (RTG). The refugees have sought safety in Tak province and there are 1,543 refugees remaining on the Thai side of the border according to the RTG., Refugees are sheltered in temporary safety areas (TSA), which are placed under the general jurisdiction of the Royal Thai Army by the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) established by the RTG in March 2021., SITUATION OVERVIEW ON THE THAI MYANMAR BORDER, In Kayin State, the Tatmadaw conducted airstrikes on 10 April, targeting opposition groups as fresh fighting broke out for control of the town of Lay Kay Kaw in Myawaddy Township. The Tatmadaw is believed to be reinforcing the area with more manpower. Lay Kay Kaw has mainly been under the control of the Karen National Union (KNU) in recent months, but the Tatmadaw has at times sought to reassert control, and fighting broke out last December. The KNU reported that March had been the deadliest month for the Tatmadaw in 2022, with more than 400 soldiers killed in over 500 clashes., On 15 and 17 April, heavy fighting took place in the area opposite Umphang District. Myanmar troops and its ally, the Border Guard Force (BGF), are in control of the regions from Lay Kay Kaw to Waw Lay. The Tatmadaw have expanded their military presence in Law Kay Kaw, Thay Baw Boe, U Kra Tha, and Kanele Tha.
They have carried out a series of airstrikes and surveillance in these areas. The offensive has resumed with both air and ground operations. Myanmar troops and the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) are now stationed in strategic locations along the border opposite Mae Sot and Phop Phra districts. In the Tanintharyi region, fighting near the Thai border has been defused. On 17 and 18 April, protests against the Military occurred in Taku Village and Pulaw Township in Myeik District and Ye Phyu township - Dawei district.
As of 2 May, there have been 578,200 internally displaced people (IDPs) in Myanmar since February, of whom 236,000 are in the southeast provinces – Kayah, Shan, Kayin, Mon States, and Tanintharyi and Bago regions.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-situation-inter-agency-operational-update-05-may-2022

This includes 500 displaced individuals who were displaced within Myawaddy Township, Kayin State following clashes between the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) and security forces in Myawaddy town. In Kyarinseikgyi Township, Kayin State, similar clashes displaced 4,750 individuals., In Mon State, two weeks of tension and clashes between the Tatmadaw and the local armed groups in Billin Township led to a significant increase of IDPs with 8,460 individuals displaced within the township. Most are seeking safety in nearby villages and the jungle although returns of up to 1,030 IDPs were also recorded in the same township., Similarly, fighting between the Tatmadaw and People’s Defence Force (PDF) in Palaw Township, Tanintharyi Region resulted in the displacement of 1,000 individuals to nearby villages and into the jungle.

Shelter and Non-Food Items
Water Sanitation Hygiene",5 May 2022,"MIMU Analytical Briefs shine a light on topical, emerging and under-explored issues relevant to humanitarian and development support in Myanmar based on analysis of available information., Each Brief includes a short narrative document and accompanying infographic as well as the dataset, methodology and an interactive dashboard to enable others to take this analysis further, This Analytical Brief focuses on the situation of household amenities in Myanmar based on the review of data from nationwide surveys over the five-year period from 2014 to 2019. As household amenities affect human health, productivity, and overall quality of life, this reveals some important developments in households' living situation., Summary,  Whereas a million more people were in paid/for profit employment nationwide by 2019, women continued to be less likely to be employed than men, and rural households were earning significantly less than those in urban areas. While ownership of mobile phones and home internet grew massively, a million households – mainly in rural areas - owned no communications devices at all as of late 2019.,  Despite considerable improvements in shelter and access to electricity for many Myanmar households, a third of the country’s households were still living in bamboo houses or short-term huts as of 2019. Myanmar’s electrification rate was the lowest in South East Asia with as many as 30 million people still not connected to the main power grid in 2019, and around 6.7 million households were dependent on solid cooking fuels, presenting additional health risks for women and children in particular.,  Although more households had access to safer drinking water from improved sources, over 2 million households were still using unimproved water sources in 2019, mainly in rural areas, with the highest reliance on unimproved water sources in Rakhine and Ayeyarwady.,  The use of improved sanitation also improved. However, 2 million people countrywide were still dependent on unimproved sanitation facilities, and a further 3 million people were practicing open defecation which brings particular risks to health, equity, dignity and safety, especially for women and girls.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/household-amenities-myanmar-2014-2019-mimu-analytical-brief-may-2022-enmy

"Atrocity Alert No. 299: Myanmar (Burma), Democratic Republic of the Congo and Accountability",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,4 May 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., MYANMAR MILITARY ESCALATES HOSTILITIES AMIDST RISING COMMUNAL VIOLENCE, Myanmar’s (Burma) military, the Tatmadaw, has been intensifying its scorched-earth campaign in Sagaing Region – a resistance stronghold – burning over 500 houses between 25-27 April alone. The Tatmadaw launched arson attacks across five villages in the townships of Mingin, Khin Oo and Shwebo, setting houses on fire and reportedly killing people. According to residents, the military has ramped up their raids since early March, when the internet was shut down in nearly three-fourths of Sagaing’s townships., The series of arson attacks are the latest in the Tatmadaw’s large-scale offensive in apparent retaliation for the actions of armed resistance groups. The research group Data for Myanmar estimated that by the end of April 2022, the military had torched more than 11,400 civilian houses across the country since the 1 February 2021 coup, including an estimated 7,500 houses in Sagaing alone. The Tatmadaw has burned houses across 10 states and regions, with Sagaing, Magway, Chin and Kayah the most severely impacted. The Tatmadaw’s ongoing scorched earth campaign likely amounts to crimes against humanity and war crimes., Communal violence is also escalating in Myanmar, increasing risks for tit-for-tat killings and reprisals. Last week a newly-formed pro-junta militia killed eight people in Mandalay, the country’s second largest city. All of the victims were members or supporters of the deposed National League for Democracy (NLD) party. On 21 April the militia – called the Mandalay branch of the Thway Thauk, or “Blood Comrades” – announced that it had launched “Operation Red” to “destroy” members of the NLD party and its supporters, as well as anti-junta resistance forces. The militia has also threatened to kill journalists who are critical of the Tatmadaw, as well as their families. It is unclear whether the militia has any ties to the Tatmadaw., Savita Pawnday, Executive Director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said, “in the year since ASEAN adopted the Five-Point Consensus, it has done little to pressure the junta to halt its assault on civilians in Myanmar. Unless the international community adopts stronger measures to hold the Tatmadaw accountable and weaken its capacity for violence, the military will continue to be emboldened to perpetrate mass atrocities around the country.” The UN Security Council must immediately attempt to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar and sanction the oil and gas sector. During next week’s Special Summit between ASEAN and the United States (US), the US government must ensure that the crisis in Myanmar is a focal point of the meeting, with the aim of moving beyond the failed Five-Point Consensus and encouraging ASEAN member states to take bilateral steps to improve the situation., CIVILIAN DEATH TOLL IN DR CONGO NEARLY DOUBLED DURING FIRST YEAR OF “STATE OF SIEGE”, Friday, 6 May, marks one year since the “state of siege” began in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s (DRC) two conflict-ridden eastern provinces, North Kivu and Ituri. President Félix Tshisekedi asserted that military control would restore peace and security in these provinces where decades of armed conflict and inter-communal violence have left thousands of people dead and forced millions to flee. Approximately 20,000 troops have been deployed to North Kivu and Ituri to combat armed groups and protect civilians., Yet the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri has deteriorated in the past year, with armed groups intensifying their attacks against civilians. According to the Kivu Security Tracker, the civilian death toll nearly doubled from May 2021 to April 2022, with at least 2,563 civilians killed in the two provinces compared to 1,374 in the same period the prior year. The majority of attacks were perpetrated by two armed groups, the Allied Democratic Forces and the Cooperative for the Development of Congo. The UN Joint Human Rights Office (UNJHRO) in the DRC has previously alleged that attacks by these groups may amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes., Some members of the government’s armed forces (FARDC) have also been implicated in serious human rights violations and abuses in the context of the state of siege. UNJHRO documented at least 231 violations, including “attacks on protected people and places…abduction, recruitment and use of children,” as well as sexual violence and torture, perpetrated by the FARDC in Masisi territory, North Kivu Province, between 6 May 2021 and 9 February 2022. UNJHRO stated that some of the violations constitute war crimes., Under the state of siege, civil authorities have been replaced with military officials who have been granted broad powers, including the authority to restrict people’s movements and arrest anyone for disrupting public order. According to investigations by Human Rights Watch, the military and police have suppressed peaceful demonstrations with lethal force and arbitrarily detained and prosecuted activists, journalists and political opposition members., The situation in eastern DRC cannot be solved through military means alone. Christine Caldera, Research Analyst at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, stated that, “the state of siege has not only failed to advance the restoration of peace and security, the volume of attacks by armed groups, as well as violations by the FARDC, has left many people living in fear of the next atrocity.” The DRC government should enact measures to re-establish trust with communities, including by consulting with civilian populations and civil society about protection needs. The authorities should also implement a vetting process to identify and suspend soldiers and officers implicated in serious human rights violations., UN SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING HIGHLIGHTS IMPORTANCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ATROCITIES, On 27 April the UN Security Council (UNSC) held an Arria-formula meeting on accountability for crimes in Ukraine. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet; Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan; and President of the Clooney Foundation for Justice, Amal Clooney, briefed the Council., High Commissioner Bachelet stated that her office has documented summary killings and executions in areas of Ukraine previously under Russian control and is working to verify reports of arbitrary arrests and conflict-related sexual violence. She also emphasized that as gross violations of international law continue unabated, the preservation of evidence of alleged violations – some of which may amount to war crimes – is crucial. A combination of pre-existing monitors – including the Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine – and new mechanisms – such as the Commission of Inquiry established by the Human Rights Council on 4 March and an ICC investigation opened on 28 February – have already allowed for the gathering and preservation of evidence, as well as the identification of some perpetrators., Despite the considerable efforts to swiftly respond to the situation in Ukraine, the international community, particularly the UNSC, has failed when responding to other atrocity situations across the world, including in facilitating justice and accountability. The UNSC has not referred a situation to the ICC in more than a decade, and in 2014 vetoed a resolution referring the situation in Syria to the Court. Even Arria-formula meetings focusing on justice and accountability are rare, with only four other such meetings held by the UNSC in the past five years. Amal Clooney emphasized that, “we have watched as perpetrators of mass human rights abuses have murdered, raped and tortured without consequence. From Darfur, to Myanmar, to Yemen. The perpetrators committed these crimes believing they would get away with it. And they were right.”, The pursuit of justice and accountability is critical to deterring future crimes and preventing recurrence, as well as for ensuring victims’ rights to justice and reparation. The international community must do more to commit to the pursuit of justice across all atrocity situations. Where possible, all states should pursue accountability for perpetrators under the principle of universal jurisdiction. All UN member states must standardize their support for the work of the ICC and drop unprincipled objections to the ICC’s jurisdiction.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-299-myanmar-burma-democratic-republic-congo-and-accountability

Submission to the Office of the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar,News and Press Release,GCR2P,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",29 Apr 2022,"In response to a call for input by the Office of the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar (Burma), the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect provided analysis on the impact of the 1 February 2021 coup on the human rights of children in Myanmar through the lens of mass atrocity risks, atrocity prevention, and the international norm of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P)., GCR2P’S ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT SITUATION, Since the 1 February 2021 coup, Myanmar’s military – the Tatmadaw – has not spared children in its ongoing violent campaign against peaceful protesters and armed resistance. Violations against children include killings, sexual violence, use of children as human shields, and the use of child soldiers. Children have also suffered as a consequence of scorched earth campaigns, forced displacement, destruction of civilian infrastructure, and lost access to medical care and education, among others. Many of the abuses in Myanmar constitute elements of the six grave violations against children in conflict and may also amount to war crimes and/or crimes against humanity., The military’s ongoing commission of mass atrocity crimes has been facilitated by its continued access to weapons through arms transfers from China, Russia, and Serbia, as the Special Rapporteur comprehensively outlined in the February 2022 report “Enabling Atrocities: UN Member States’ Arms Transfers to the Myanmar Military.” Arms transfers exacerbate conflict and can facilitate the commission of atrocity crimes, including the recruitment of child soldiers and the use of human shields, both of which constitute war crimes under international law. There are reports that the Tatmadaw has forced some children to undergo training and join the military. While the Tatmadaw appears to be the main perpetrator, some ethnic armed groups are also using child soldiers., There are also reports that the Tatmadaw has abducted, detained, and tortured children, sometimes specifically targeting children whose parents are believed to be members of the resistance as a form of retaliation. These violations may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity., Myanmar’s military has manifestly failed to uphold its responsibility to protect the people of Myanmar – including children – from atrocity crimes. More concerningly, the international community has also largely failed to uphold R2P in responding to the crisis in Myanmar. The UN Security Council has notably failed to impose a global arms embargo on Myanmar or sanction the country’s oil and gas sector, where the Tatmadaw receives most of its revenue., RECOMMENDATIONS, GCR2P welcomes that the Special Rapporteur has consistently centered much of his analysis on the crisis in Myanmar around atrocity risks and the military’s commission of atrocity crimes. GCR2P encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue focusing on atrocity risks and atrocity crimes, including with regard to the human rights of children in this upcoming report. An atrocity lens best conveys the severity and urgency of the crisis, which in turn can push international actors to take more effective action. An atrocity lens also has the most potential to hold the Tatmadaw accountable for its commission of the gravest international crimes., GCR2P also welcomes that the Special Rapporteur has often invoked the Responsibility to Protect in urging the international community to take more substantial action to respond to the crisis in Myanmar. GCR2P encourages the Special Rapporteur to continue invoking R2P – including in this upcoming report – to push the international community to take more effective action to protect the human rights of children in Myanmar.

To do so we regularly train community volunteers and staff to effectively identify and prevent malnutrition., For example, May Htar Swe is nearly three years old and participates in PIN’s nutrition programme thanks to financial support from the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund (MHF). She lives in the Tin Htein Kan displacement site with her four siblings. In January 2022, PIN’s field team and our community volunteers conducted their monthly mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) screening for children aged 6 months to 59 months in targeted displacement sites in Mrauk U township. During one of the screenings, May Htar Swe was found to have moderate acute malnutrition (MAM)., May Htar Swe is the youngest child in her family and was born at the Tein Nyo Station hospital, Mrauk U township, Rakhine State. Her mother, Daw Yin Ma Oo (45), says, “I was exclusively breastfeeding her during the first six months of her life, and always prepared healthy foods when she reached the age to start complementary feeding. But she didn’t have an appetite and ate little food. She has been tiny since she was born. Being a mother and living in the displacement site, I try hard to feed my children nutritious food, but everything has been difficult since we arrived here.”, Collaborative nutrition services for malnourished children, In collaboration with Myanmar Health Assistant Association (MHAA), PIN referred May Htar Swe to MHAA’s Outpatient Therapeutic Programme (OTP) at Wet Hla IDP site, which provided her with Ready-to-Use Supplementary Food (RUSF). RUSF is a food supplement that is intended to be eaten for two or three months alongside regular food., In addition, PIN and our nutrition community volunteers conducted regular follow-up visits to May Htar Swe. They provided infant and young child feeding (IYCF) counseling to her mother about safe, nutritious cooking methods, food preparation, and characteristics of complementary feeding, as well as important caring and hygiene practices. PIN also provided funding for transportation and meal costs for both the child and her mother to cover the costs of necessary travel during treatment., Daw Yin Ma Oo is thankful to PIN and our community volunteers, “After 4 or 5 weeks of outpatient treatment at MHAA’s OTP, my daughter is improving and reaching normal measurements during the MUAC screening. We thank PIN for covering transportation costs and other costs associated with the OTP clinic. Also, PIN has provided us with nutritious foods, such as vegetable cooking oil and things like hand soap, toothbrushes, and other nutrition services. I am happy that she is healthy now, has gained weight, and has also gotten her appetite back.”, Community volunteer approaches to nutrition services, Using various community volunteer approaches, PIN has trained volunteers on things such as basic nutrition concepts, IYCF practices, detection of malnutrition through MUAC measurement, the organisation of mother support groups and capacity building to conduct community awareness-raising workshops. Ma Phyu Phyu Htay, a nutrition community volunteer, says, “Since I live in the same displacement site, I can regularly monitor the children’s status until they reach the normal nutrition status measurement by MUAC, which is 12.8 centimetres. I am really happy and proud of myself that I can support the community.”, Ko Wai Yan Aung, PIN’s Nutrition Technical Officer, explains the current situation of the nutrition programme, “After informing the community that a volunteer has identified a MAM case, one of our nutrition field officers visits the Tin Htein Kan IDP site to confirm the case. Then we refer this case to MHAA’s OTP and collaborate to supply supplementary food by MHAA. In addition, we provide money to cover the costs of visits to the clinic for the affected family. This is in accordance with our standard operating procedure for the nutrition programme. Now that May Htar Swe is in normal condition, we’ve awarded her mother a counselling gift. We provide these gifts to those who’ve been affected by moderated acute malnutrition in some way and have cured it.”, Ko Wai Yan Aung adds, “With help from our community volunteers, PIN has organised the formation of eighteen mother support groups in nine displacement sites in Mrauk U township. Discussion-based mother support groups bring together mothers of children under the age of five, pregnant women, and lactating women to provide a safe space to promote IYCF practices. These practices include exclusive breastfeeding, complementary feeding for children six months of age, safe cooking methods, and hygiene and caring practices on a weekly basis.”, From January to March 2022, PIN has conducted continuous MUAC screenings for a total of 255 boys and 296 girls and plans to raise awareness about key IYCF practices and the importance of good nutrition through a series of community events which have been organised by community volunteers and PIN’s field team in April 2022., Author: Sone AyePyae",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/supporting-conflict-affected-children-suffering-malnutrition

Protection and Human Rights",29 Apr 2022,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Htaw Ta’Htoo (Htantabin) Township, Taw Oo (Toungoo) District during the period between December 2021 and February 2022, and includes State Administration Council (SAC) military activities, SAC attacks on Civil Disobedience (CDM) participants, travel restrictions, and livelihood, healthcare and education challenges. SAC soldiers continued their activities, including patrolling, questioning people whom they encountered, beating and arresting people, and conducting reconnaissance by air. People who participated in the CDM faced challenges as the SAC destroyed their property. The SAC increased their checkpoints, seized motorcycles, arrested people, and required approval to travel. Political instability and travel restrictions also made it difficult for villagers to find work and thus created livelihood challenges for the villagers. There have also been many challenges in the healthcare sector since the military coup, and the presence of SAC soldiers in public hospital compounds made villagers afraid to go for treatment and medical care. Some schools have reopened but only some students returned to school. Students who take online classes faced problems because the price of internet services has increased., SAC military activities, On December 20th 2021, after State Administration Council (SAC) soldiers entered into Lay Lon Pin area, Htaw Ta’Htoo (Htantabin) Township, Taw Oo (Toungoo) District where Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) Battalion #6 operates, seven SAC soldiers died after stepping on a landmine planted by KNLA soldiers. The KNLA soldiers also confiscated some of the weapons from the SAC [the context is unclear]. Some SAC soldiers entered into the villages, but were not wearing their military uniforms while they were patrolling and therefore villagers mistook them for the People’s Defence Force (PDF)., Some [uniformed] SAC soldiers were also patrolling at the intersection of Kyi Daw and Aung Myin Yan during the night and if they saw anyone, they would ask them questions and would even beat up people who went out at night after 8:00 or 9:00 pm. SAC soldiers have also mistaken some of the villagers for PDF members. On January 16th 2022 [and possibly a second date], guns were fired at midnight in Kyi Daw village, Kyi Daw village tract[5], Htaw Ta’Htoo Township. In hearing the sound of gunfire, local villagers were not sure whether it came from SAC soldiers or from the PDF., When staff from Electric Power Corporation (EPC) came to collect [villagers’] electricity bill payments in January 2022 [exact date unknown], SAC soldiers came with them. The local villagers were afraid when they saw the soldiers. When they [EPC] came to collect the electricity bill payments in Nat Ywa village, Per Htee village tract, Htaw Ta'Htoo Township they only went to a few houses and left hurriedly because they were also worried that they would be harassed by the PDF [in order to scare them, some villagers had told them that PDF members might come to attack them if they came to the village]., SAC soldiers sometimes came to check the guest list in some of the Burmese [Bamar] villages as well, and if they saw anyone who seemed strange and unfamiliar to them, they would take him/her with them [arrest the person]. SAC military jets also started to come [fly over] and the local villagers always had to stay alert. Since fighting also took place in Kayah State, the local people from there came to seek refuge in several places in Htaw Ta’Htoo Township, Taw Oo District., SAC soldiers have been checking motorcycle licenses at Htantabin Bridge and, on February 17th 2022, arrested one villager from Lay Ti village, Per Htee village tract, Htaw Ta'Htoo Township and one Bamar man [his village is unknown]. They [SAC] had never checked motorcycle licenses at this place before. After arresting these two people, they stopped checking other people who were travelling on that day because they said that they were only required to seize two motorcycles per day. The two people arrested were locked up in the detention centre and were not given any food to eat. They were arrested at around 9:00 am and were released at 9:00 pm that same day.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/taw-oo-district-situation-update-sac-military-activities-sac-attacks-cdm-participants

Water Sanitation Hygiene",29 Apr 2022,"A small state containing the serenity of the Ngwe Taung Dam. Home to many ethnic groups and tribes. A land of breath-taking nature: waterfalls, mountains, and caves. For all its beauty, Kayah State is now seeing violence that is tearing families from their homes., Following intense clashes, several thousand people from Loikaw, Demoso, Hpruso and Pekon were forced to seek refuge in Southern Shan State. They are now sheltering in monasteries, churches or staying with relatives across Taunggyi, Hsiseng, Ping Long, Nyaung Shwe, Kalaw, Pinthadaya, Lawt Sauk and Laikha townships., Our teams were able to visit some of these displaced families to support them., For many among the displaced, this is the first time they have had to leave their homes. It is hard to adjust. Many wait anxiously for the opportunity to return, often with little hope. For families, the uncertainty leads to concerns about the future – with no end in sight given the ongoing clashes., Since January this year, ICRC teams in Lashio and the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS), have visited several sites where people displaced from Kayah have sought shelter. We conducted rapid assessments, to see what families needed urgently and tried our best to meet these fundamental needs., During a first rapid assessment, we worked together with the MRCS to plan next steps in a humanitarian response. Our engineers focused on access to clean water and shelter. Other team members sought to ensure families would have enough food, or tried to reconnect family members who had been separated. Our teams spoke with people about their experiences and planned logistics to help provide future support., Many of those who were displaced are seeking shelter in urban areas, but some have been forced to shelter in the rural countryside, where access to water and electricity can be more challenging. Temporary electricity blackouts remain common. But support from local monasteries and churches has helped in the short term. Bringing what they could carry, some of those who were displaced also took care of their immediate needs: blankets, sleeping mats, mosquito nets, and small supplies of food. But it is planning for the longer-term needs of these displaced communities that remains a concern., Displacement due to armed conflict also causes loss of livelihoods. For safety, jobs are left behind. Some of those who left Kayah are trying to earn a daily wage by finding work, but job opportunities are hard to come across. Traveling further afield to find work is also a risk, compared to the relative safety of temporary shelter in a church or monastery. Displacement makes all these life decisions more challenging., To help as much as possible in the short term, we provided useful items such as dignity and hygiene kits, as well as food. We did this work together with the MRCS – from planning to distribution., ""Our team is a mix of many technicians, including engineers and others who help respond in emergencies, so that we can address the most urgent needs as fast as possible""., While churches, monasteries and host communities are helping many of those who are displaced, concerns remain over the rising likelihood of food shortages in the long run., Our team is still on the ground, working together with communities affected by conflict and the MRCS to monitor and identify the most urgent needs.

Effective third-sector actors in aid on the Thailand-Myanmar border,News and Press Release,New Mandala,Protection and Human Rights,29 Apr 2022,"AUNG OAK AWW, In the cold and dark winter nights, refugees sleep beside the Moei river with no shelter or blankets. Their only resources are donations from regional civil society organisations (CSOs)*: *Myanmar migrant-based community-based organisations (CBOs) in Thailand, Karen region-based CSOs and some Thailand CSOs. Thailand CSOs are sanctioned by the Royal Thai Army, and cooperate with Myanmar’s revolutionary forces such as the KNLA, People’s Defense Force (PDF), and select forces within the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA). The international community, on the other hand, has had no concrete plan to help Myanmar refugees and residents struggling with the effects of Tatmadaw attacks in southern Myanmar., As conflict broke out between the Myanmar Tatmadaw (military) and Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) forces in “peace township” Lay Kay Kaw in December 15, 2021, serious artillery shootings and air strikes by the Tatmadaw resulted in thousands fleeing to Thailand. This conflict was only one of many effects of the ongoing armed conflict since the Myanmar coup of February 1, 2021., What the international aid community and governments urgently need to push now is cooperation between the Thai government and ASEAN to accept new refugees in Thailand, to ensure cross-border humanitarian assistance for IDPs on the Thailand-Myanmar border. This can be achieved by cooperating with effective third sectors actors on the ground to distribute aid for those in need. In addition, Myanmar refugee and migrant-focused CSOs such as border-based charities, Myanmar migrant workers associations, and ethnic region-based CSOs must be allowed to freely operate in the border regions., In southeast and southern Myanmar, the KNLA, the Karen National Defense Organization (KNDO) (the armed wings of the Karen National Union) and the Karenni Army (KA) (the armed wing of the Karenni National Progressive Party), are giving thousands of urban Burmese military training and mobilising the People’s Defense Forces (PDFs), Karenni Nationalities Defense Forces (KNDFs) and Burma People’s Liberation Army (BPLA). These two ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) control areas which are adjacent to the Thailand border, an area currently under siege by Tatmadaw offensives. Populations in these areas are facing the high risk of crimes against humanity. These offensives will likely increase in the future, resulting in further displacement as the number of refugees to Thailand increase., Refugees fleeing armed conflict need to have safe refuge in areas far from the Tatmadaw’s air strikes and artillery; they should not be asked to return to dangerous zones as previous refugees have been forced to. After the airstrikes on March 27, 2021, residents of Mutraw (Papun) district fled to the Thai-Myanmar border, but were turned around by Thai border authorities. Similarly, refugees fleeing a Tatmadaw invasion of Lay Kay Kaw areas were turned back to Myanmar., “We have been living between these two riverbanks for more than two months. When fighting closes in on the Myanmar side, we cross the Moei river and stay on the Thai side. We are asked to return to the Myanmar side when the artillery shelling stops,” a resident of Lay Kaw Kaw staying in Moei riverbank, shared with me., Recent visits by the United Nations (UN) special envoy to Thailand have appealed to Prayuth Chan-Ocha, the Thai Prime Minister to provide assistance to Myanmar refugees, IDPs, and the restoration of democracy in Myanmar. The two-day visit by Washington’s senior officials in the second week of October, 2021 also called for Thailand to ensure cross-border life-saving assistance along the Myanmar border. But Bangkok has no formal policy for long-term Myanmar refugees on their border., However, as the Moso massacre in Karenni state demonstrates, provision of cross-border lifesaving assistance is not possible while the Tatmadaw continues to target civilian populations with air strikes and artillery shelling. The Tatmadaw has even cut off food and medical supplies to their operation areas., It is imperative that the UN, US, ASEAN and neighboring member states like Thailand ensure the security of aid routes from CBOs and CSOs along the Thai-Myanmar border; these plans must include new concrete plans to aid refugees within Thailand’s borders. Yet, at the time of writing, Thailand is drafting more restrictive NGO law, which is bound to affect the humanitarian assistance available at the border., The main concern of activists and revolutionaries within the Myanmar community so far has been the effect of international legitimacy on the junta regime’s culture of impunity; many fear that international recognition will give the military free rein to continue the perpetration of serious war crimes, kleptocracy, and the oppression of people in Myanmar., International aid agencies in Myanmar who have tried to engage with the junta have incurred the anger of Myanmar activists and social workers, and consequently, “social punishment” on sites like Facebook. The international community needs to engage with the right local partners to provide aid effectively on the Thailand-Myanmar border., Myanmar refugees and migrant-focused CSOs have the experience with providing aid in the border areas and social capital with the war on community. During the Lay Kay Kaw airstrikes, for example, Myanmar refugees and migrant-focused CSOs such as border-based charities, Myanmar migrant workers associations, and ethnic region-based CSOs provided aid to refugees with local funding, access which international organisations could not provide. These third sector actors are vital partners for international and long-term access and distribution to aid in Myanmar., These partners include three key groups. First, Myanmar migrant-based CBOs, especially migrant workers associations in Thailand, are essential intermediaries––despite not being well-known as refugee aid providers. These CBOs are well-established across Thailand, particularly in cities like Mae Sot and Samut Sakhon (Mahachai). Their contributions have provided aid to people in Myanmar long before and after the coup in February 2021., The second effective third sector actor is ethnic region-based CSOs, such as Karen and Karenni regional organisations who are also essential providers of cross-border humanitarian assistance. They have extensive experience with providing aid in the southern Myanmar, an area plagued by decades-long armed conflict since the 1990s between the Tatmadaw and ethnic armed groups in Karen and Karenni region-based areas. These ethnic region-based CSOs have been the main service providers in healthcare and education and advocates for human rights and environmental issues., Third, cross-border based charities and refugee camps at the Thai-Myanmar border, particularly in Mae Hong Son, Tak, and, Kanchanaburi are also familiar with international aid, and already possess good institutional support and structures to manage refugee affairs. These CSOs have the network for humanitarian assistances and cross border aid distribution. Because of their institutional capacity and background, these CSOs would be effective service providers if the Bangkok government agrees to new refugee camps at Thailand side., Tatmadaw offensives in the last few months have not only targeted and destroyed civilian livelihoods and homes; their actions include a wide range of crimes against humanity. If international agencies are eager to provide aid, they should be careful to avoid any engagement with the junta regime, or risk eliminating humanitarian assistance for those who need it most: refugees on the Thai-Burma border in Karen and Karenni state, and IDPs in Karen and Karenni regions., Relying upon these third-sector organisations also helps to mediate between international agencies and local humanitarian organisations, thereby avoiding engagement with the junta which would anger many in the resistance movement in Myanmar. More attention needs to be given to these border-based actors, as they are the most realistic means of distributing much-needed aid in Myanmar now., Maung Oak Aww (pseudonym) is a researcher based on the Thailand-Myanmar border. His research specialises in the role of civil society organisations and war on populations in southern Myanmar.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/effective-third-sector-actors-aid-thailand-myanmar-border

Protection and Human Rights",28 Apr 2022,"This Situation update describes events that occurred in Ler Doh (Kyaukkyi) and Moo (Mone) townships, Kler Lwee Htoo (Nyaunglebin) District between August 2021 and February 2022, and includes information on human rights violations committed by the State Administration Council (SAC). Local villagers experienced suppression of the right to information, travel restrictions and torture. Military activities also increased, and included indiscriminate shelling, the transportation of 8,750 sacks of rice to frontline army camps and the sending of about 400 more soldiers (five battalions) to the frontline. As a result, local villagers are facing increased security risks and livelihood challenges, and some have been forced to displace without access to humanitarian support or healthcare.[1], Right to information and travel restrictions, On August 22nd 2021, villagers from Htee Toh Loh village, Paw Pee Der village tract[2], Moo (Mone) Township, Kler Lwee Htoo (Nyaunglebin) District were prohibited by the State Administration Council (SAC)[3] from watching [television] from Skynet (PSI) [satellite service provider]. They [the SAC] said that if they watched movies [news] from Skynet, they would come [enter the village] and arrest people in their houses., On August 25th 2021, they [SAC] set up checkpoints beside the public road outside of Aaw Law See village, T’Hkaw Pwa village tract and inside Kyon Pin Hseik village, Kone Ni village tract, Moo Township. They also set up checkpoints in Yay Ao Sin village, Ton Taw village, and Mone Town, Moo Township. Villagers had to carry recommendation letters [from the village administrator] with them whenever they passed these checkpoints., On January 25th 2022, a villager from Htee Toh Loh villager, Paw Pee Der village tract, Moo Township was stopped on the road near Yay Ao Sin village by SAC soldiers at 7:30 pm. They told him that they would punish him if they saw him again [the reason for the threat is unclear]. They also told him that no one would be able to bring prosecution against them if they hurt him. He had been returning to his village after going to Mone Town. As a result of this incident, villagers were afraid to travel and they faced difficulties because they couldn’t do anything even when they had things that needed to be taken care of [in another area]. Some of the villagers also faced food scarcity and they no longer dared, for instance, to go out to hunt rats at night [for food]. The information above is about the challenges that villagers in Moo Township, Kler Lwee Htoo District have been facing, such as food shortages and travel restrictions., At 5:30 pm on January 28th 2022, [the SAC] village head and SAC soldiers announced a curfew so that no one could go out [of their house] from 7:00 pm to 5:00 am. Also, no one is allowed to use a VPN [virtual private network], watch VOA [The Voice of America] or BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation] news, or have any type of connection with the People’s Defence Force (PDF)[4]. If anyone was caught using any of these [prohibited services] or had connections with the PDF, [SAC soldiers threatened to] take legal action against them [it is unclear what type of legal action was being referred to]., Torture, On October 8th 2021, a bomb exploded sometime between 7:30 pm and 8:00 pm in Mone Town, Moo Township. After the explosion, SAC soldiers from Light Infantry Battalions (LIBs)[5] #599 and #590 came [to the incident place], checked people on the road, and beat people who were travelling [on the road]. [During this SAC operation], one of the local car drivers was shot [by the SAC]. He did not die, but he had to be admitted to the hospital., Starting from November 10th 2021, SAC soldiers from LIB #590 at Yay Ao Sin army camp and LIB #599 at Kon Daw army camp began entering into [patrolling in] nearby villages such as Htee Toh Loh village, Paw Pee Der village tract, Kyon Pin Seik village, Kone Ni village tract and Aww Law See village, T’Hkaw Pwa village tract, Moo Township at night. They stopped any people they saw [during patrolling] and beat those people., SAC activities and security concerns, At around 8:00 pm on January 18th 2022, SAC soldiers from LIB #590 entered Htee Toh Loh village, Paw Pee Der village tract, Moo Township making everyone in the village afraid. People who left government jobs [CDM participants] as well as young and single people [probably villagers who were 15 years old and older] had to hide and sleep on their farms. Since SAC military oppression has been increasing, villagers have been living in greater fear so there is no more safety for life [the lives of civilians]., SAC military transport rations and increase the number of their troops in the area, On November 20th 2021, the SAC military [battalion numbers unknown, but likely LIBs #351, #124, #589, #598, and Infantry Battalion (IB)[6] #440] transported rations to Than Bo military camp, and army bases in the north-eastern part of Ler Doh Town, Kler Lwee Htoo District. On December 4th 2021, they [SAC troops] also started transporting rations to their army camps along the Mu Theh vehicle road, namely, Mu Theh army camp (also known as Koh Thay Soh military camp), Ler Doh Township, as well as other military camps such as Hpwa Gaw army camp in Mu Traw District. Within one month, they were able to finish sending rations to Mu Theh army camp. In total, 8,750 sacks of rice were transported to their frontline camps [in Ler Doh Township]. In the meantime, they [SAC] also sent five new battalions to Ler Doh Township: LIBs #351, #124, #589, #598, and IB #440, numbering approximately 400 troops in total. These five new battalions are temporarily based along Mu Theh vehicle road. IB #75, [already] based in Mu Theh military camp, provided security [for the transportation of the troop rations]. Min Tin Aung, the [SAC] operations commander of the six battalions [the five new battalions plus IB #75] was in charge of managing the transportation of the rations., SAC indiscriminate shelling, On December 7th 2021 at about 7:00 pm, soldiers from the KNLA and KNDO ambushed the SAC’s rations store [in Mu Theh army camp]. In retaliation, SAC soldiers [from Mu Theh army camp] fired mortars into H--- village, Kheh Ka Hkoh village tract, Ler Doh Township. As a result of the shelling, three villagers were injured and some villagers’ houses were damaged. The three injured villagers are Saw[7] A--- (age 25), Saw B--- (age 11), and Naw[8] C--- (age 11)., On December 12th 2021, when [SAC] LIB #124 troops returned from Brigade 5 [Mu Traw District] to Ler Doh Township, they saw two villagers harvesting crops on their farm at Thay Nweh Hta place. The soldiers shot an M79 grenade launcher more than 10 times near the two villagers, frightening them. The two villagers, Naw R--- and Saw W--- (mother and son) from Kheh Der village tract, Ler Doh Township, did not sustain injuries., On December 18th 2021, another attack occurred in Mu Theh village, Kheh Der village tract, Ler Doh Township at 7:40 pm when SAC troops fired mortars into the village. The village church and some of the villagers’ houses were damaged as a result of the shelling., After the fighting in Mu Theh village in early December 2021, villagers from Mu Theh village had to flee to other villages, to their farm huts or into the forest. Some of the IDPs’ family members had to go back to their houses to feed their livestock and then return to their hiding places. On December 30th 2021, a Mu Theh villager [an IDP] named Saw O--- was shot at by a [unknown] SAC soldier with an EMER K-3 assault rifle [a type of assault rifle made in Burma by the Electrical Mechanical and Engineering Corps] when he came back to his village to feed his pigs. However, he managed to flee from the SAC soldier without getting hit., On January 1st, February 16th, February 18th and March 6th 2022, SAC LIB #590 from Yay Ao Sin army camp fired guns about three to fifteen times on each of the three days [in the area near their army camps]. It frightened many people so villagers from Yay Ao Sin, Htee Toh Loh, Sin Pin Than and Mone Shan Paing villages, Moo Township were afraid and felt unsafe to travel., Fear and displacement, Beginning in November 2021, the SAC engaged in increased military activities in Ler Doh Township. The SAC not only sent more troops, but they also used aircraft and helicopters to make it easier [and safer] for their troops to transport their rations to Mu Traw District. The helicopters were mainly used to conduct reconnaissance so the rations could be safely transported. Due to the increased number of SAC troops in the local area, local villagers were in fear; at night, villagers had to go hide and sleep in the forest, their farm huts, or in other villages and then would return to their village in the morning. Some of the villagers, especially villagers from Kheh Ka Koh village tract and Kheh Der village tract, Ler Doh Township, have fled to other places., On February 22nd 2022, at 3:00 pm, two SAC helicopters came to Kheh Ka Hkoh village tract, Ler Doh Township. One of the helicopters landed at Mu Theh army camp and picked up their [SAC] injured soldiers, and another helicopter conducted reconnaissance over the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO)[9] Battalion #3’s territory. [On the same day] at 5:00 pm, all villagers in X--- and Z--- villages, as well as many other villages in Kheh Der village tract, Ler Doh Township, left their villages and fled to safer places due to fear that airstrikes might take place in their villages., Since the military coup, civilians in Ler Doh Township have been facing many challenges due to the SAC military’s oppression [operations against ethnic minorities], and some of the villagers had to flee from their village. Some of the villagers cannot return to their village and they are still fleeing in the forest. Currently, there are around 1,589 displaced people. Civilians across Ler Doh Township are currently in a constant state of fear [of airstrikes] because SAC aircraft/helicopters frequently conduct reconnaissance in the local area. As a result of SAC reconnaissance operations, villagers have to sleep in the forest and it causes challenges for the villagers to regain their livelihood. The things [humanitarian support] that villagers are currently in need of are food, healthcare supplies, and security., Healthcare, During December 2021, the SAC’s oppression of villagers in the local area of Ler Doh Township has increased. As a result, there has been an increase in displacement, so local villagers face more challenges in areas such as healthcare. Villagers also face a shortage of supplies, including healthcare supplies. Also, there are no clinics, and only one health worker team - the Back Pack Health Worker Team (BPHWT)[10] - operates in the local area, so many villagers cannot access healthcare services., Further background reading on the security situation in Kler Lwee Htoo District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, “Kler Lwee Htoo District Short Update: SAC troops fired mortars into a village, injuring three villagers, December 2021**”, January 2022., “Kler Lwee Htoo District Incident Report: Arbitrary arrest of civilians by SAC military in Moo Township, August 2021**”, January 2022., “Kler Lwee Htoo Short Update: Arbitrary arrest and killing, July 2021**”, August 2021., “Where should I flee next?’: Fighting and displacement in Doo Tha Htoo, Kler Lwee Htoo and Mu Traw districts, December 2020 to January 2021”, April 2021., Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received between January 24th 2021 and March 7th 2022.

"Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: Deliberate SAC shelling at religious event results in civilian deaths, injuries and property damage in Tha Htoo Township, September 2021",Situation Report,KHRG,Protection and Human Rights,28 Apr 2022,"This Short Update describes events that occurred in W--- village, T’Maw Daw village tract, Tha Htoo (Thaton) Township, Doo Tha Htoo (Thaton) District on March 19th 2022, in which the SAC military deliberately shelled the village while villagers were gathering for a religious event. As a result of the shelling, three villagers, including a 7-year-old boy, were killed; 11 villagers, including two children, were injured, and villagers’ possessions, such as three cars and two motorcycles, were damaged.[1], Deliberate Shelling, On March 19th 2022 at 9:00 pm, State Administration Council (SAC)[2] Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[3] #9, based with Artillery Unit # 402 in Way Raw (Win Pa) village, fired two mortars into W--- village, T’Maw Daw village tract[4], Tha Htoo (Thaton) Township, Doo Tha Htoo (Thaton) District where a religious (Buddhist) event was taking place., Deaths, As a result of the shelling by SAC troops, three villagers, including a 7-year-old boy, were killed. The three villagers killed by shrapnel from the SAC attack were Daw[5] Day Tho (aged 50) and Saw[6] Eh Hpoh Hser (aged 7), both from W--- village, T’Maw Daw village tract, Tha Htoo Township, and Daw Ngway Kyi (aged 54) from H--- village, Maw Lay village tract, Tha Htoo Township. One of the victims, Daw Ngway Kyi was selling balloons at the religious event during the incident. Daw Ngway Kyi regularly sold balloons at festival events in the community to provide for her family’s livelihood, so it is a great lost for her family., Injuries, Moreover, the SAC attack resulted in 11 villagers being injured, including two children living in G--- village, T’Maw Daw village tract. Two villagers were seriously injured [in critical situation], including a 12-year-old boy Saw S---., The 11 injured villagers are from G--- village, K--- village, M--- village and W--- village in T’Maw Daw village tract and L--- village in T’Ree Hkee village tract, Tha Htoo Township and also Lay Taing [Section], Thaton Town. They are: Naw[7] I--- (age 6), Saw S--- (age 12), Naw Z--- (age 19), Saw N--- (age 20), Saw E--- (age 26), Saw Y--- (age 27), Naw O--- (age 27), Saw A--- (age 44), Naw B-- (age 28), T--- (age 27) and H--- (age 32). The villagers suffered a range of injuries to their legs, feet, back, stomach, upper chest, head, eyes (blurred vision), and face., The injured villagers covered their medical expenses through donations that were collected in the village. No external organisations have helped cover medical expenses., Based on an update from a KHRG researcher on March 22nd 2022, 12-year-old Saw S--- is now recovering at the local hospital in U--- village, Ta T’Reh village tract, Hpa-an Township. Two other injured villagers are now recovering at the local hospital in T’Maw Daw village tract, and the remaining eight villagers are receiving treatment at home. There were no villagers displaced by the shelling. However, villagers fear more SAC shelling and therefore sleep every night in the makeshift bunkers under their houses., There are about 229 households and an estimated 1,473 villagers living in W--- village. On the day the religious event took place, there were about 50 to 60 villagers who had joined the event. Regarding the shelling by SAC troops into the religious event, one villager from W--- village stated, “It is not an event held by the enemy. It is not Karen Revolution Day. It is not Karen Martyrs’ Day. It is not appropriate that they were firing mortars into the event.”, Property Damage, In addition, as a result of the SAC shelling, three cars and two motorcycles owned by local villagers were damaged [while the villagers were attending the event in W--- village]. Specifically, one car and one motorcycle owned by Daw B--- from C--- village, one car owned by U[8] D--- from F--- village, one car owned by Saw Q--- from J--- village, and one motorcycle owned by Saw X--- from W--- village, were damaged., Further background reading on the security situation in Doo Tha Htoo District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, *“Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: Ongoing fighting in Bilin Township leads to more than 2,000 IDPs, as well as injury and property damage, December 21st 2021 to January 11th 2022**”, *March 2022., “Doo Tha Htoo District Situation Update: Forced portering and the use of civilians as human shields, and updates on livelihood, health and education, August to September 2021**”, February 2022., “Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: Forced labour, looting and skirmishes been the SAC and the KNLA, August 2021**”, December 2021., Footnotes:, [1]The present document is based on information received on March 22nd 2022.

"Phone surveillance, from scratch: Novel sample design features of the nationally representative Myanmar Household Welfare Survey (MHWS), Strategy Support Program | Working Paper 16 March 2022",Manual and Guideline,IFPRI,Coordination,27 Apr 2022,"ABSTRACT, The first round of the Myanmar Household Welfare Survey (MHWS)–a nationwide phone panel consisting of 12,100 households–was implemented between December 2021 and February 2022., The objective of the survey was to collect data on a wide range of household and individual welfare indicators–including wealth, livelihoods, unemployment, food insecurity, diet quality, health shocks, and coping strategies–in a country exceptionally hard hit by conflict, severe economic collapse, and several damaging waves of COVID-19. The respondents interviewed in the MHWS were purposely selected from a large phone database aimed at being representative at the region/state level and urban/rural level in Myanmar., In this paper, we discuss two key steps taken to ensure that the MHWS is nationally and subnationally representative at the state/region and urban/rural level. First, we used a quota-based sampling strategy by setting survey quotas for respondents’ geography, education, farming status, gender, and rural/urban residence. This sampling strategy is used to address the well-known drawbacks of phone survey samples (e.g., the over-sampling of more educated respondents) and the survey’s particular interest in over-sampling farm households and equally sampling men and women. Second, we constructed household, population, and individual level weighting factors to further ensure that the survey generates nationally and subnationally representative statistics., To assess the effectiveness of these two strategies on achieving representativeness and consistency with previous surveys, we compare results from the MHWS to earlier nationally representative datasets, focusing on sample sizes of interviewed households for each state/region, and on education levels, farm/non-farm occupation, urban/rural residence, as well as respondents’ housing characteristics, which are unlikely to change substantially over short periods of time. We show that the phone-based MHWS has broader geographical coverage than previous national surveys, reaching 310 of Myanmar’s 330 townships. Moreover, our sampling approach was generally effective in reducing the education bias of phone surveys, except for a handful of states/regions. The MHWS is also unique in providing equal representation of male and female respondents. Additionally, the MHWS sampling and weighting strategies produce statistics on key indicators that closely mirror results from the two most recent national surveys in Myanmar. Overall, the results suggest that these strategies are successful in generating a subnationally representative phone survey that collected data on a rich array of household welfare indicators in exceptionally difficult political and economic circumstances.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/phone-surveillance-scratch-novel-sample-design-features-nationally-representative

HARP-F multi-year WASH funding review [EN/MY],Evaluation and Lessons Learned,Crown Agents,Water Sanitation Hygiene,7 Apr 2022,"Executive Summary, Authored by The Operations Partnership,December 2021., WHAT IS HARP-F?, The Humanitarian Assistance and Resilience Programme Facility (HARP-F) is a UK Government Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) initiative launched in 2016. HARP-F is the grant-funding mechanism, and the largest component of the wider Humanitarian Assistance and Resilience Programme. It is managed by Crown Agents. It has so far committed £74.7 million, reaching 1.69 million conflict-affected people via 76 grants, across 8 sectors and in collaboration with 55 partners., WHY REVIEW HARP-F MULTI-YEAR WASH FUNDING?, Since 2016, HARP-F has been the largest funding mechanism for humanitarian water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) support in Myanmar. Over the last 6 years HARP-F WASH programming has supported 315,000 conflict-affected people in Kachin, Northern Shan, Rakhine and Chin States, with grants totalling £22.4 million., The case for multi-year humanitarian funding was established as part of the Grand Bargain in 2016. Since then, HARP-F has been the main provider of multi-year humanitarian WASH funding in Myanmar, providing 95% of all humanitarian WASH multi-year funding in Myanmar between 2017 and 2021., This strategic review outlines what has been learned about WASH multi-year funding and identifies where, and how, this learning could be applied in the future. 71 specialists, representing 22 organisations, were consulted via key informant interviews (KII) and focus groups. This included staff from HARP-F, FCDO, the WASH cluster and from the majority of key WASH actors working in Myanmar., 7 KEY LESSONS LEARNED FROM HARP-F MULTI-YEAR WASH PROGRAMMING, Provision of “Long term” multi-year funding (>24 months) was a key factor in supporting substantial advances in community ownership and management of WASH services in a challenging operating environment (central Rakhine IDP camps), “Medium term” multi-year funding (12-24 months) was effective in supporting a structured process of local NGO capacity development (mostly evidenced in Kachin/NSS). It was crucial to maintain coordination with other capacity building providers for this funding to be effective. 96% of WASH actors consulted in this review agreed that HARP-F funding has been effective in empowering local and national actors., Multi-year funding of any duration (12 months or more) helped implementing agencies build programme quality and led to administrative and operational cost savings in comparison to typical short term humanitarian funding. This is consistent with previous research on multi-year funding. 93% of WASH actors consulted in this review agreed that multi-year funding substantially increased programmatic impact. Those consulted reported that more time was spent on creating value with targeted communities rather than meeting the increased administrative requirements that back-to-back short-term funding involves., A contextualised strategy framework for WASH programming was helpful in guiding HARP-F support to partners, HARP-F funding decisions and HARP-F partner planning. It outlined relevant approaches to sustainability and resilience for the key operating contexts in Rakhine and Kachin States., HARP-F recognised the difficulty that a funding gap would present for local NGOs and tried to mitigate the risk of this happening. Local NGOs do not typically benefit from the funding reserves that many INGOs have. Given the effort invested by HARP-F and partners in LNGO capacity development it was crucial that HARP-F found ways to ensure sustained funding for local NGOs working in a protracted crisis., The M&E approach needed to be better at capturing outcomes and learning. There would be increased benefit from multi-year funding, and stronger evidence for the future, if M&E approaches were designed to understand emerging long-term outcomes and learning. A results/outputs focused humanitarian M&E approach is not sufficient., Multi-year thinking and planning was encouraged alongside multi-year funding. The HARP-F experience shows that multi-year funding is not the only tool that can support programme quality, efficiency and longer-term WASH outcomes. In a protracted crisis multi-year planning approaches should be encouraged at all levels. There were examples of this happening in Myanmar at both the WASH cluster and implementing organisation levels., APPLYING THIS LEARNING, There was a significant scale-up of the humanitarian response during 2021 to respond to new needs following the military takeover in February. Unfortunately, the situation continues to be unstable and unpredictable. Humanitarian access remains a significant challenge. Humanitarian organisations have set an ambitious target of assisting 6.2 million people in 2022. The financial ask identified in the Humanitarian Response Plan is three-times that of 2021., HARP-F will end its programming in March 2022. Since HARP-F currently supports 95% of multi-year WASH projects, it is critical for other funding organisations to consider financing multi-year WASH projects.
Continued funding from new sources is important for the sustainability of capacity investments made in communities and local NGOs via HARP-F., There is a risk that the current level of uncertainty in Myanmar could dissuade donors from making multiyear funding commitments. However, short-term funding will yield only short-term results. It seems highly likely that humanitarian access will continue to be a critical problem. Well supported and capacitated community organisations and local NGOs may be the only lifeline available to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to the most vulnerable in many locations., Continuing and deepening support to communities and local NGOs is a critical strategy for the overall response. Multi-year funding is the most effective way to accomplish this in WASH, and in many other sectors., RECOMMENDATIONS, Humanitarian actors and donors in Myanmar should, Advocate for multi-year WASH funding, especially where long term outcomes are envisioned, or access constraints are likely to be sustained. Multi-year grants with a duration of 2 years or more (in keeping with the OECD definition) are preferred because of the increased efficiency and programme impact gains that can be achieved over such a period., Where multi-year funding is not possible, adopt multi-year plans at the agency, donor and cluster levels. Meanwhile, the situation at community level should be closely monitored to help identify when the situation is sufficiently stable for multi-year funding., Consider adopting multi-year funding and planning modalities for emergency response programming, employing an adaptive management approach. This can also provide a framework that will enable local NGO response capacities to be further strengthened., Humanitarian, development and peace actors in Myanmar should, The Global WASH cluster should",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/harp-f-multi-year-wash-funding-review-enmy

This included staff from HARP-F, FCDO, the WASH cluster and from the majority of key WASH actors working in Myanmar., 7 KEY LESSONS LEARNED FROM HARP-F MULTI-YEAR WASH PROGRAMMING, Provision of “Long term” multi-year funding (>24 months) was a key factor in supporting substantial advances in community ownership and management of WASH services in a challenging operating environment (central Rakhine IDP camps), “Medium term” multi-year funding (12-24 months) was effective in supporting a structured process of local NGO capacity development (mostly evidenced in Kachin/NSS). It was crucial to maintain coordination with other capacity building providers for this funding to be effective. 96% of WASH actors consulted in this review agreed that HARP-F funding has been effective in empowering local and national actors., Multi-year funding of any duration (12 months or more) helped implementing agencies build programme quality and led to administrative and operational cost savings in comparison to typical short term humanitarian funding. This is consistent with previous research on multi-year funding. 93% of WASH actors consulted in this review agreed that multi-year funding substantially increased programmatic impact. Those consulted reported that more time was spent on creating value with targeted communities rather than meeting the increased administrative requirements that back-to-back short-term funding involves., A contextualised strategy framework for WASH programming was helpful in guiding HARP-F support to partners, HARP-F funding decisions and HARP-F partner planning. It outlined relevant approaches to sustainability and resilience for the key operating contexts in Rakhine and Kachin States., HARP-F recognised the difficulty that a funding gap would present for local NGOs and tried to mitigate the risk of this happening. Local NGOs do not typically benefit from the funding reserves that many INGOs have. Given the effort invested by HARP-F and partners in LNGO capacity development it was crucial that HARP-F found ways to ensure sustained funding for local NGOs working in a protracted crisis., The M&E approach needed to be better at capturing outcomes and learning. There would be increased benefit from multi-year funding, and stronger evidence for the future, if M&E approaches were designed to understand emerging long-term outcomes and learning. A results/outputs focused humanitarian M&E approach is not sufficient., Multi-year thinking and planning was encouraged alongside multi-year funding. The HARP-F experience shows that multi-year funding is not the only tool that can support programme quality, efficiency and longer-term WASH outcomes. In a protracted crisis multi-year planning approaches should be encouraged at all levels. There were examples of this happening in Myanmar at both the WASH cluster and implementing organisation levels., APPLYING THIS LEARNING, There was a significant scale-up of the humanitarian response during 2021 to respond to new needs following the military takeover in February. Unfortunately, the situation continues to be unstable and unpredictable. Humanitarian access remains a significant challenge. Humanitarian organisations have set an ambitious target of assisting 6.2 million people in 2022. The financial ask identified in the Humanitarian Response Plan is three-times that of 2021., HARP-F will end its programming in March 2022. Since HARP-F currently supports 95% of multi-year WASH projects, it is critical for other funding organisations to consider financing multi-year WASH projects.
Continued funding from new sources is important for the sustainability of capacity investments made in communities and local NGOs via HARP-F., There is a risk that the current level of uncertainty in Myanmar could dissuade donors from making multiyear funding commitments. However, short-term funding will yield only short-term results. It seems highly likely that humanitarian access will continue to be a critical problem. Well supported and capacitated community organisations and local NGOs may be the only lifeline available to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to the most vulnerable in many locations., Continuing and deepening support to communities and local NGOs is a critical strategy for the overall response. Multi-year funding is the most effective way to accomplish this in WASH, and in many other sectors., RECOMMENDATIONS, Humanitarian actors and donors in Myanmar should, Advocate for multi-year WASH funding, especially where long term outcomes are envisioned, or access constraints are likely to be sustained. Multi-year grants with a duration of 2 years or more (in keeping with the OECD definition) are preferred because of the increased efficiency and programme impact gains that can be achieved over such a period., Where multi-year funding is not possible, adopt multi-year plans at the agency, donor and cluster levels. Meanwhile, the situation at community level should be closely monitored to help identify when the situation is sufficiently stable for multi-year funding., Consider adopting multi-year funding and planning modalities for emergency response programming, employing an adaptive management approach. This can also provide a framework that will enable local NGO response capacities to be further strengthened., Humanitarian, development and peace actors in Myanmar should, The Global WASH cluster should",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/harp-f-multi-year-wash-funding-review-enmy

Better living conditions for displaced people in Rakhine State,News and Press Release,PIN,Shelter and Non-Food Items,22 Apr 2022,"After three years of conflict in Rakhine State, internally displaced people (IDPs) face many challenges. Due to the armed conflicts between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and the Arakan Army (AA) lasting from late 2018 to November 2020, many still live in makeshift shelters across the state., People in Need (PIN) continues to deliver humanitarian assistance to conflict-affected populations in Rakhine State. Before the rainy season begins, it is essential to maintain and repair makeshift shelters. With financial support from the Myanmar Humanitarian Fund (MHF), PIN provided emergency shelter kits to 750 households, alongside shelter kits provided by UNHCR. Additionally, PIN provided 235 collective shelter sets to 11 internal displacement sites in Mrauk U and Kyauktaw townships, Rakhine State in 2021., Urgent requirements for sheltering, U Ba Kyaw, a site leader at the Pya Hla IDP site in Mrauk U township, shares his concerns regarding the accommodation of IDPs sheltering there, “Our shelters are made of bamboo and tarpaulin, created in previous years as a temporary measure. Most of our shelters at the Pya Hla site where more than 900 people are sheltering are damaged and IDPs are facing difficulties living there. Among them, 50 households urgently need to reconstruct their entire home.” said U Ba Kyaw. “Before the rainy season, at least 50 households returned to their villages in Pauktaw township, but most of them returned soon after because Myanmar military troops are residing near their village. They are afraid and do not dare go back again.”, He adds, “PIN distributed shelter kits and other necessities aids to us, it was very helpful. Pya Hla site is now sheltered in the compound of a Buddhist monastery. Some houses moved outside of the monastery compound and were rebuilt again. We need more support for shelters. However, international organisations and UN agencies provide us with shelter, food, and cash distributions. Thank you to these organisations and donors for supporting us.”, PIN plans to support these needs by distributing an additional 230 emergency shelter kits to 9 displacement sites in 2022 with support from MHF., Shelter and NFI materials support for IDP sites, Rakhine state is part of the most disaster-affected areas in Myanmar. It is regularly impacted by cyclones and floods, and displaced people are most vulnerable. During the rainy season, most IDPs are facing challenging living conditions in IDP sites. Temporary shelters, built in early 2019, need immediate repair or reconstruction. IDPs in these sites are reliant on aid assistance provided by international and national organisations., PIN address the essential needs of IDPs as per their requests, together with the shelter kits supported by UNHCR, PIN distribute additional shelter kits, which include traditional building materials items such as bamboo, myaw post, and thatching/nipa palm leaves as of building materials for traditional styles for 9 targeted IDP sites in Mrauk U U township. (Author: People in Need), Daw War War Naing, a mother of three who lives in Wet Hla IDP site, Mrauk U township, says, “Our house needs to be repaired before the rainy season comes. We already face difficulties and prices are skyrocketing. We cannot afford to buy wood and bamboo to rebuild the house. That is why we are waiting for the shelter kits from international organisations and relevant governmental officials. Last year, PIN provided shelter kits that were useful for us. However, we need to repair or rebuild soon.”, PIN address the essential needs of IDPs as per their requests, together with the shelter kits supported by UNHCR, PIN distribute additional shelter kits, which include traditional building materials items such as bamboo, myaw post, and thatching/nipa palm leaves as of building materials for traditional styles for 9 targeted IDP sites in Mrauk U U township.

She already rebuilt her small hut by borrowing money because it was destroyed by strong winds and weather. “I cannot wait until assistance comes because my small hut was already damaged. Even though I do not have money to rebuild the house, I borrowed it from others at high rates. This small hut cost 80,000 kyats (USD 50). Regardless of borrowing money, I was afraid that if heavy rain and strong winds came, we could not stay at our hut.” she explains., In 2022, PIN address the essential needs of IDPs as per their requests.

Myanmar: International community must do more to protect brave protesters,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,22 Apr 2022,"Myanmar’s brave activists are still pursuing peaceful protests despite grave danger and numerous challenges, Amnesty International said today, one year after the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) adopted Five-Point Consensus that has abjectly failed to stop the violence in the country., In recent months, Amnesty International conducted in-depth interviews with 17 people who have continued to take part in non-violent protests across five of Myanmar’s states and regions. The interviewees were from a diverse array of protest groups, including LGBTQ and women’s rights organizations., One of the most popular methods of protesting has been “flash mobs” where activists run through the streets for a few minutes before dispersing to avoid being shot, arrested or run over by military vehicles., The public has also held “silent strikes” across the country, during which shops and businesses shut down, roads emptied, and people stayed home to show defiance to military rule., Across Myanmar, activists and human rights defenders have been distributing pamphlets on buses, posting messages against the military on walls with stickers or spray paint, and encouraging boycotts of goods and services with ties to the military., “These activists urgently need the support of the international community in the form of a global arms embargo to stop the Myanmar military from using weapons of warfare to kill peaceful protesters,” said Emerlynne Gil, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Research., “The ASEAN must call on the Myanmar military authorities to immediately stop all violence against peaceful protestors in line with the stalled Five-Point Consensus. It should do so now to prevent the Myanmar people from further suffering.”, “It must also continue to unequivocally condemn all human rights violations in Myanmar and call for the release of all individuals who are arbitrarily detained.”, “THEY TRIED TO HIT ME”, In the days immediately following the coup, Amnesty International and many other human rights groups urged the military to stop the use of unlawful and lethal force against peaceful protesters. The violence has since prompted many to join armed resistance groups, which are active throughout the country., Amnesty International has called on the military to exercise restraint, abide by international law, and for law enforcement duties to be fully resumed by police., These calls have gone unheeded. More than 1,700 people have now been killed, and more than 13,000 arrested since the military took power, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners., Activists and human rights defenders interviewed by Amnesty International described witnessing or experiencing abuses by military forces while demonstrating, including shootings, beatings, and attempts to ram vehicles into protests., The brutal response of the military had an enormous impact on the nonviolent protest movement. During the latter part of 2021, there was a noticeable decrease in the number of people who joined protests in the streets., “We went from tens of thousands to thousands, thousands to hundreds, and hundreds to around twenty,” said Thiri*, a university student in Mandalay who said she had no interest in politics before the coup but is now one of the leaders of a women’s protest group., However, the reduced number of protesters taking to the streets may also be a matter of strategy. Some of the activists that Amnesty International spoke with said they were intentionally organizing the protests in smaller groups to keep everyone safe., Rina, a university student and member of the General Strike Committee in Yangon, said that it had become “too dangerous” to protest in large groups., She participated in a flash mob with around 20 other people on 5 December 2021 and she recounted to Amnesty International that on that day, as they gathered, a military truck drove straight into them. “As I was running, I saw some of the other people who joined in the flash mob had been hit [by the military truck]. Some of them were rolling on the pavement.”, In the Kachin State capital of Myitkyina, a university student who has been protesting with the University of Myitkyina Students’ Union, said that they usually go out in smaller groups because “if there are too many people in the protest, it is easier to get arrested.”, Zin Mar, another university student who is a protest leader in Monywa, said that although her protest group sometimes had to reduce the number of people demonstrating for security reasons, they were determined to continue. “We will always come out whenever we can,” she said., Min Thu, a high school student who is a leading member of the Mandalay Youth Strike Committee, has witnessed unmarked vehicles which he believes to belong to the military and police accelerate into protesters during at least three instances. In October 2021, a motorcycle nearly hit him when he was about to join a protest., “Just before we started the protest, they tried to hit me [with the vehicle] from the front,” Min Thu said. “I escaped by going to the nearest road and then they got down from their vehicle and pointed guns at me. They didn’t shoot me because they had blocked all the angles, and they thought they would arrest me.” He told Amnesty International that he dodged onto a side street and barely escaped., In Sagaing region’s Salingyi and Yinmarbin townships, poet and engineer Yar Zar has regularly organized people across villages to protest since March of last year, and was at two protests when soldiers and police opened fire at the crowd., To avoid encountering soldiers, he and his team carefully prepare routes along narrow, unpaved streets. He is one of several people who told Amnesty International that they also rely on volunteers to check and make sure the route is clear before they demonstrate., “When we protest in the village, some protesters who act as lookouts escort us so we can avoid the military. Once they have passed, we start our protest again,” said Phyu, a village protest leader in Thayetchaung township, Tanintharyi region., Protest groups have also been distributing pamphlets and using social media to call for a boycott of goods and services with ties to the military, and have been posting anti-coup messages in public spaces., LIFE ON THE RUN, Many activists described to Amnesty International how they felt like they were constantly watched and followed by civilian informants known as dalans or by soldiers and police wearing civilian clothes and driving unmarked vehicles., Myat Min Khant of the All Burma Federation of Student Unions said that the military and police roam streets disguised as fruit sellers or trishaw, motorcycle, or taxi drivers and embed themselves among the people to surveil anyone daring to express dissent., There are also numerous checkpoints in towns and cities around the country. People are stopped at random, and their belongings are searched by soldiers and police. Thus, activists either leave their devices at home or delete messages and applications on devices when they go out for fear that they could be arrested., Surveillance by the military adds to the challenges in organizing protests, according to Moe Thouk, a protest leader with the General Strike Committee in Yangon., They use CCTV cameras to follow activists, employ dalans in every ward to gather information, and arrest activists while wearing civilian clothes, he said. “They roam around places where protests often take place. We need to carefully choose the right place [to protest] and rely on scouts for safety,” said Moe Thouk., Most of the activists who spoke to Amnesty International said that they have left their homes for safety reasons, and several of them have not been able to be back home at all since February 2021., “If I go back home, the military may be waiting to arrest me,” said Nan Lin of the University Students’ Union Alumni Force. “Even my family members do not know my whereabouts.”, BP, a protest leader who has demonstrated on the streets of Kalay, Sagaing region every day since 7 February 2021, said that a convoy of five vehicles full of soldiers raided his family home three times in one day in September 2021. He is one of four protesters interviewed who said their homes have been raided after they have left and gone into hiding., But while they fear going home, many of these activists said it is becoming harder and harder to find safe places to hide. BP told Amnesty International that he regularly sees strangers who he believes are plainclothes informants loitering near the vicinity where activists are staying or following them on motorbikes while carrying walkie-talkies., U Yaw, a monk from Ayeyarwady region who has been actively protesting since the early days after the coup, had been in hiding since March 2021 when his monastery was raided. During the raid, as U Yaw hid in a toilet stall, he overheard soldiers saying that if they found him, they should “just shoot him dead and get rid of him.”, He fled to Mandalay and resumed protesting, but soldiers and police raided the monastery there where he was hiding in June. He took shelter in another monastery which was raided by soldiers and police in September 2021., He escaped just in time, but the soldiers and police confiscated his identification documents and cash. U Yaw continued to protest despite the risks., THREATENING FAMILY MEMBERS, In many cases, soldiers and police have taken into custody family members and loved ones of activists if they were unable to find the activists and arrest them, including a politicians’ 94-year-old mother and an activist’s four-year-old daughter, according to media reports, In April 2021, soldiers and police raided the house of Arkar, an activist who had gone into hiding., “Because they couldn’t find me and arrest me, they arrested my mother,” he said. “I got a call from the police station and I was told that I should give myself up in exchange for the freedom of my mother.”, Arkar did not turn himself in, and his relatives were able to negotiate his mother’s release the next day by paying a bribe. Arkar’s family have since moved to a new home to avoid further reprisals. Arkar is one of four people who told Amnesty International that their families were forced to leave their homes because of safety concerns., In November 2021, the military attempted to raid the house of another protest leader who had gone into hiding. “When they arrived, they started shooting, but they went to the wrong house. They mistakenly went to our neighbor’s house and one woman was killed because of the shooting,” the activist said., Her family was able to escape but she has not contacted them since for fear that she would be putting their lives at further risk. She is currently moving from place to place, and said she has trouble sleeping due to fear of arrest., “We have to be vigilant 24 hours a day. We get startled even when we just hear a cat jumping onto the roof. We worry about getting arrested when we go out, and when we are in the house, we are scared they will come in and arrest us. We have completely lost our sense of security,” she said., She is determined, though, to continue organizing peaceful protests. “I cannot sit quietly when I see injustice,” she told Amnesty International., A resolve to keep protesting nonviolently is shared by many of the activists., “Despite the immense dangers and hardships, there are still many activists and human rights defenders who choose to remain in Myanmar and who are unwavering in their commitment to continue peacefully protesting and expressing their dissent,” Amnesty’s Emerlynne Gil said., Many of them said they continue their peaceful protests to inspire more people in the country to action and to give people hope. “The main reason I continue protesting is so that the people do not become divided or lose enthusiasm, and so that they can get strength by seeing us,” said the monk in Mandalay, U Yaw., “Although our lives are in danger, we choose to continue. We will keep asking the world to help us because people are being killed in Myanmar,” said Zin Mar, the protest leader in Monywa., *Note to editors: In several cases pseudonyms have been used at the request of interviewees",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-international-community-must-do-more-protect-brave-protesters
Myanmar: ASEAN’s Failed ‘5-Point Consensus’ a Year On,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,22 Apr 2022,"Key Countries Should Overhaul Approach to Junta’s Atrocities, (Bangkok) – Southeast Asian governments should urgently revamp their response to Myanmar’s abusive junta by coordinating action with the broader international community, Human Rights Watch said today. Despite adopting a “five-point consensus” on the crisis a year ago, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has failed to fulfill its pledges or take meaningful steps toward pressing the junta to end its human rights violations., “Myanmar’s junta has spent the past year committing atrocities in utter disregard for its commitments to ASEAN,” said Elaine Pearson, acting Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The ASEAN countries leading on Myanmar – Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore – should immediately alter their course to focus on protecting people’s rights and freedoms rather than helping the junta remain in power., At a summit in Jakarta on April 24, 2021, the nine ASEAN leaders and Myanmar junta chief, Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, agreed to five points: an immediate end to violence in the country; dialogue among all parties; the appointment of a special envoy; humanitarian assistance by ASEAN; and the special envoy’s visit to Myanmar to meet with all parties. In the year since, Min Aung Hlaing has defied each point while overseeing a brutal nationwide crackdown aimed at suppressing the millions of people opposed to military rule., Two days after the consensus agreement, the junta walked back its endorsement, announcing it would consider the “suggestions made by ASEAN leaders when the situation returns to stability.” Rather than halting attacks as called for, the junta ramped up its abuses. Junta violations since the coup include mass killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and indiscriminate attacks on civilians that amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes., Security forces have killed over 1,700 people, including at least 130 children, and arbitrarily arrested over 13,000. The military has expanded abusive operations in ethnic minority areas, displacing more than 550,000 people. Instead of heeding the consensus by allowing aid delivery, the junta has deliberately blocked humanitarian assistance from reaching populations in need as a form of collective punishment., The five-point consensus, meanwhile, has become a pretext for governments such as the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, and European Union member states to delay real action under the guise of waiting for ASEAN leadership, Human Rights Watch said. The junta has exploited the international community’s deference to the regional bloc, which has a long record of neglecting its responsibility to protect the people of Southeast Asia under its principles of noninterference and consensus., ASEAN appointed Brunei’s second foreign minister, Erywan Yusof, as its special envoy to Myanmar last August. His planned visit to the country in October was canceled when the junta denied him access to Aung San Suu Kyi and other detained civilian leaders, a precondition of his visit and requirement under the consensus., The junta has indicated it will continue to block efforts to meet with Suu Kyi and other detained individuals, or with entities it has declared “unlawful,” including the shadow civilian government, the National Unity Government (NUG)., In an unprecedented censure by the bloc, ASEAN barred Min Aung Hlaing from its biannual summit in October, with only a non-political representative invited to attend. Singapore announced it was a “difficult but necessary decision to uphold ASEAN’s credibility given the unsatisfactory and highly limited progress in the implementation of the ASEAN Leaders’ Five-Point Consensus.” The junta ultimately declined to attend., Myanmar’s refusal to meet the consensus commitments has exposed fractures within ASEAN. Several ASEAN countries – notably Malaysia and Indonesia, often alongside Singapore and the Philippines – have publicly criticized the junta’s intransigence, calling for a continued ban on political representatives from future summits., However, Cambodia, this year’s ASEAN chair, has renewed engagement with the junta, with Prime Minister Hun Sen visiting Myanmar in January, the first foreign leader to do so. The current special envoy, Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn, met in late March with Min Aung Hlaing and other junta officials despite their refusal to grant access to Suu Kyi., Prak Sokhonn’s claims of “meaningful outcomes” were immediately belied when Min Aung Hlaing, in his speech on Armed Forces Day, March 27, announced that the military “will no longer take into account negotiation with the terrorist groups and their supporters,” referring to the NUG and anti-coup movement, and will seek to “annihilate them to an end.”, On January 28, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet called the international response “ineffectual,” stating that “the actions taken by the UN Security Council and by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been insufficient to convince Myanmar’s military to cease its violence.” In her March report to the Human Rights Council, Bachelet noted that despite the consensus, ASEAN leaders “have not achieved tangible results.”, Leading ASEAN countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, should work closely with other governments to develop a clear, timebound approach to press Myanmar’s junta toward reform, including increasing restrictions on its foreign currency revenues and weapons purchases. ASEAN should signal its support for a UN Security Council resolution instituting a global arms embargo, referring the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court, and imposing targeted sanctions on junta leadership and military-owned companies., US President Joe Biden, who will host ASEAN members at a summit in May, should press Southeast Asian leaders to abandon their failed consensus approach and encourage greater cooperation with other countries promoting stronger action against the junta’s rights abuses., Over 50,000 refugees from Myanmar have fled to Thailand and other neighboring countries since the coup. Those governments should end all forced returns of asylum seekers and instead ensure refugees receive access to aid and international protection procedures, as well as facilitate emergency cross-border aid., “For a year, governments around the world have stalled taking action on Myanmar by standing behind ASEAN’s hollow words – and have nothing to show for it,” Pearson said. “They need to adopt strong measures to deter further atrocities and hold the military accountable, not a flimsy consensus that’s proven its futility.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-asean-s-failed-5-point-consensus-year

"Myanmar South East - Monthly Displacement Snapshot - Trend of people displaced in South East since Feb 2021 and remain displaced, as of 28 Mar 2022",Infographic,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,31 Mar 2022,"SE WEEKLY HIGHLIGHTS, In the South-East, during the first week of March the total number of IDPs slightly decreased from 230,800 to 228,900. In Shan State (South) 3,040 IDPs have returned to Loikaw town in Kayah State due to the temporary and relative improvement of the security situation in places of origin since 15 February. In Kayin State, 150 additional individuals were displaced within Hpapun Township at the borders with Hlaingbw. The large majority of the Hpapun town residents have already been displaced due to the deterioration of the situation in the area. In Tanintharyi Region, the situation remained tense. Displacement continued within Palaw Township with about 150 new IDPs verified., During the second week of March, about 2,400 individuals were newly displaced and about 310 were secondary displacements. The increases were counterbalanced by returns of around 2,500. Consequently, the total number of IDPs slightly decreased to 228,800 from 228,900 last week. In Kayin State, 1,750 were displaced as a result of continuous clashes and airstrikes. In Shan State (South), returns continued to areas of origin within the state as well as towards neighbouring Kayah State. In total, around 2,500 IDPs returned to Pekon Township in Shan State (South), as well as to Loikaw and Demoso townships in Kayah State. The overall situation continues to be volatile nevertheless with several clashes reported this week. In Kayah State, fighting in Demoso Township resulted in the secondary displacement of 310 IDPs., In the third week, the number of IDPs increased to 230,000 from 228,800 due to new displacements and verification of IDPs displaced in prior weeks. In Kayin State, the situation in Hpapun and Myawaddy townships continued to deteriorate. Several clashes and airstrikes occurred around Kawakareik Township, resulting in the forced displacement of about 4,100 people, mostly within the township and also towards Hpa-An Township and Thandaunggyi Township. In addition, several IDPs in Thandaung-gyi who have been displaced since mid-February were verified, including 50 individuals who were displaced towards Mon State. In Shan State (South), clashes in Pekon Township resulted in the displacement of 2,460 people within the township. In Kayah State, the situation in Demoso Township continued to be tense with security risks prompting 3,220 IDPs to move to safer locations within the township and also towards Shan State’s Pekon and Hsihseng townships. In Shan State (South) in Pekon Township 3,300 IDPs returned to villages of origin within the township, while 2,120 IDPs in Hsishseng Township returned to Loikaw Township in Kayah State., During the last week of March, the number of IDPs increased from 230,000 last week to 231,800. In Shan State (South), some 6,700 IDPs displaced between January and March were verified with most originating from Pekon Township. Secondary displacements continued to occur with 1,000 IDPs displaced again within Pekon Township due to insecurity and shortages of food and water. Concurrently, returns within and from Shan State (South) continue to take place with 2,500 IDPs returning to Pekon town while about 50 IDPs returned to Loikaw town in Kayah State. In Tanintharyi Region, 300 IDPs were displaced to Palaw Township due to clashes. In Kayin State, the reduction in armed clashes in the southern part of Kawkareik Township led to the return of 1,550 IDPs to their places of origin. However, other parts of the township continue to be affected by the conflict with reports of people attempting to cross the border to Thailand to seek safety.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-south-east-monthly-displacement-snapshot-trend-people-displaced-south-east-6

Impact of a gender and nutrition behavioral change communication amid the COVID-19 crisis in Myanmar’s Central Dry Zone,Analysis,IFPRI,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition
Gender",20 Apr 2022,"ABSTRACT, Social behavior change communication (SBCC) interventions on gender and nutrition are now commonly implemented, but their impact on diet quality and empowerment is rarely assessed rigorously. We estimate the impact of a nutrition and gender SBCC intervention on women’s dietary diversity and empowerment in Myanmar during an especially challenging period—the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The intervention was implemented as a cluster-randomized controlled trial in 30 villages in Myanmar’s Central Dry Zone. Our analysis employs data from the baseline survey implemented in February 2020 and a phone survey implemented in February–March 2021 and focuses on women’s dietary diversity and sub-indicators of the project-level women’s empowerment in agriculture index (pro-WEAI). Two indicators of women’s empowerment―inputs to productive decisions and access to and decisions over credit―improved, indicating that SBCC interventions can contribute to changing gendered perceptions and behaviors; however, most of the empowerment indicators did not change, indicating that much of gendered norms and beliefs take time to change. Women’s dietary diversity scores were higher by half a food group out of 10 in treatment villages. More women in treatment villages consumed nuts, milk, meat or fish, and Vitamin A–rich foods daily than in control villages. We show that even in the setting of a pandemic, a SBCC intervention can be delivered through a range of tools, including household visits, phone-based coaching, and voice-based training, that are responsive to local and individual resource limitations.
Gender messaging can change some gendered perceptions; but it may take more time to change deeply ingrained gender norms. Nutrition messaging can help counter the declines in dietary quality that would be expected from negative shocks to supply chains and incomes.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/impact-gender-and-nutrition-behavioral-change-communication-amid-covid-19-crisis

Water Sanitation Hygiene",19 Apr 2022,"This regular update, covering humanitarian developments up to 12 April, is produced by OCHA Myanmar in collaboration with the Inter-Cluster Coordination Group and UN agencies. The next humanitarian update will be issued in May 2022., HIGHLIGHTS & KEY MESSAGES, • Across Myanmar, as of 11 April, 912,700 men, women and children remain displaced. This includes 566,100 people displaced by the conflict and insecurity since the military takeover in February last year. For the first time, displacement in the northwest has exceeded 300,000 people., • Humanitarians continue providing critical life-saving assistance to displaced people and host communities wherever they can, including through local partners in the face of serious access constraints., • Increasing challenges are being reported by clusters around roadblocks and checkpoints, transportation of supplies and incomplete coverage by local partners in several conflict areas., • Despite access challenges and funding shortfalls, food security partners have reached 1.4 million people with life-saving assistance – a quarter of the Cluster’s target for 2022., • The Nutrition Cluster is facing pipeline breaks for both preventative and therapeutic nutrition supplies as early as June., • Amid escalating dangers from landmines and explosive ordnance in conflict areas, clusters have agreed to scale-up mainstreaming of risk education across all sectors., • There remains high risk of transmission of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) in protracted IDP camps in Rakhine amid significant WASH gaps, as well as reliance on water trucking, and potentially boating, at the peak of the dry season in some areas., • Shelter repair gaps in Rakhine’s IDP camps are a significant concern heading into the monsoon season with more than 550 longhouses, sheltering more than 28,000 IDPs, considered structurally unsound and in urgent need of reconstruction., • Preparedness plans are being updated ahead of the rainy season to ensure a timely and efficient response in the event of an emergency in high-risk areas., • Funding for the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), which requests US$826 million to reach 6.2 million people in need of life-saving support, is critical. Only 5 per cent ($37.2 million) of required funds have been received at the end of the first quarter of 2022 (FTS). All clusters are underfunded, which impedes their ability to respond to the growing needs and gaps in response., KEY FIGURES, 912K People internally displaced across Myanmar, 566K People currently displaced by clashes and insecurity since February 2021, 346K People internally displaced mainly in Rakhine, Kachin, Chin, and Shan due to conflict prior to February 2021, 8K Civilian properties estimated burnt or destroyed since February 2021., Displacement figures fluctuate during any given month. These figures represent the number of people currently displaced. Cumulative numbers for returns and displacement are not always available., SITUATION OVERVIEW, Ongoing fighting in the country’s east and northwest has exacerbated the humanitarian and displacement situation.
The use of heavy weapons, including airstrikes and artillery fire, as well as landmines and the presence of explosive remnants of war (ERW) continues to claim lives and pose risks to the safety and security of the civilian population, especially Internally Displaced People (IDPs). Since the military takeover, at least 1,600 people, including over 100 children, have been killed, and thousands injured or maimed according to Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).2 During the first two months of 2022, UNICEF recorded 53 casualties from landmines and ERW alone. (See page 5 of this update for more details), Hundreds of thousands of men, women, boys and girls have fled their homes for safety since the February military takeover, many of them forced to move multiple times exposing people to grave protection risks. As of 11 April 2022, the number of new IDPs since the military takeover in 2021 stands at 566,100, according to UN figures, bringing the total number of IDPs across the country to 912,700. In addition, it is estimated that 36,100 people from Myanmar are currently displaced in neighbouring countries. This includes 34,500 in India and 1,600 in Thailand., At least 8,262 houses and other civilian properties, including churches monasteries, schools, and markets have reportedly been either burnt down or destroyed, mainly in Sagaing and Magway regions and Chin and Kayah states. (See page 3 of this update for more details), The stressful financial situation already facing many vulnerable families after COVID-19 and the recent conflict has been placed under further strain by fresh price rises, especially for fuel since the start of the conflict in Ukraine which has impacted on global supply. According to WFP price monitoring, the price of fuel has increased by 18 per cent from February to March 2022 and is more than double the price (up 133 per cent) compared to February 2021.3The next round of monthly data is expected to show even steeper hikes. This has serious implications for people’s ability to purchase food and other essentials and if it becomes protracted, will also have an impact on the cost of humanitarian operations in 2022. In the HRP 2022, clusters anticipated continued inflation (ranging from 15-35 per cent depending on the cluster) but the ICCG will conduct a fresh stocktake of these impacts in the coming weeks., Against this backdrop of conflict, the monsoon season is now approaching, placing another burden on the lives of vulnerable and displaced people in high-risk areas and adding new urgency to addressing shelter and NFI funding gaps. While the first storm of the season reached the Rakhine coast with limited impact at the end of March, the weather system was a timely opportunity to refresh preparedness planning. In the lead up to the storm, the de facto Rakhine State authorities evacuated some 300 people to a primary school in Yone Ka Htoe village in Gwa township and at least 90 vulnerable IDPs, including elderly people and persons with disabilities, were relocated to cyclone shelters in Sittwe. The de facto authorities immediately activated the respective township-level Disaster Management Committees (DMCs), instructed Village Tract leaders to prepare cyclone shelters around camp areas to accommodate Rohingya IDPs in Sittwe and put in place a plan to relocate IDPs in Pauktaw township to high ground, if needed. Each district office of the Department of Disaster Management stored non-food items to cover 1,000 families as part of the initial response. Operational humanitarian partners in Rakhine immediately undertook preparedness activities at the sub-national level, disseminating disaster preparedness messages around cyclone, flood and landslide risks in Rohingya languages in camps in Sittwe and in Pauktaw townships. The Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG) also convened an emergency meeting in Yangon to take stock of preparedness actions before the storm hit. Humanitarian partners have been recently updating their national emergency response preparedness plans for 2022 in preparation for the monsoon season and in the event of an emergency, will coordinate with the relevant de facto authorities to ensure an immediate and efficient response., Overall, humanitarian actors, in close coordination with local partners, continue providing critical life-saving assistance to the most affected people but face ongoing challenges in addressing urgent needs due to access constraints and funding shortfalls. To meet their obligations to people in need, humanitarian actors, including the UN, international and national NGOs, need quicker, simpler and more predictable access processes. Visa, banking, registration, and MOU blockages remain major obstacles to effective response and must urgently be resolved. It is critical that new banking rules introduced by the Central Bank on foreign currency transactions do not hamper the ability of humanitarian organizations from accessing funding for life-saving work. Significant funding gaps persist, a quarter of the way into 2022. To date, only 5 per cent ($37.1 million) of the $826 million requested in the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan, has been received (FTS). Continued underfunding of this magnitude will have life-threatening consequences for millions of people in 2022. Donors are urged to give generously, in solidarity with the people of Myanmar to save lives and protect hard-fought development gains while there is still a window to do so. Donors and funding recipients are also reminded of the importance of up-to-date and complete reporting of funding flows to the Financial Tracking Service to ensure that a clear picture of gaps is available to support decision-making.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-update-no-17-19-april-2022
Monitoring the Agri-food System in Myanmar 2022 - Understanding the rapid price increase of vegetable oils,Analysis,IFPRI,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",18 Apr 2022,"Key findings, Prices of vegetable oils, and palm oil in particular, have been rising rapidly in the country. Average retail prices rose nationally by 122 percent over the last year (March 2022 compared to March 2021). As vegetable oils typically make up 5 percent of the food expenditures of Myanmar consumers, this price increase is causing significant hardship, especially for poorer households., Vegetable oils are less available in retail markets, especially so in conflict-affected areas, compared to the same period last year., This lower availability and high prices are leading to lower use: 63 percent of food retailers indicate that less vegetable oils were bought by consumers in March 2022 compared to a year earlier., The local price increases and lower availability are explained by: 1) International price increases. Palm oil prices in international markets have gone up rapidly over the last year because of supply issues in producing countries and in the last month in particular because of the crisis in Ukraine (a major sunflower oil supplier). 2) Depreciation of the local currency. The MMK/USD official exchange rate depreciated by 25 percent over the period mid-March 2021 to mid-March 2022. Market rates showed an even higher depreciation. 3) Policy change. The military government put a licensing and import quota system in place, limiting palm oil imports in the country., Recommended actions, Licensing, import quota systems, and differential exchange rates seem to lead to lower availability and less transparency in the vegetable oil market. These policies should best be re-evaluated as to assure affordable prices for Myanmar consumers., Easing mobility constraints and other measures to ensure efficient trade will facilitate availability in the country overall and in conflict-affected areas in particular., To make local oil production more competitive, support is needed for seed growers and oil millers to scale up the existing production capacity and productivity of groundnut, sunflower, and sesame, especially through an improved business setting that includes access to appropriate inputs, credit and capital, and a secure trade environment.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/monitoring-agri-food-system-myanmar-2022-understanding-rapid-price-increase-vegetable
Agricultural value chains in a fragile state - The case of rice in Myanmar,Analysis,IFPRI,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",18 Apr 2022,"1. INTRODUCTION, An estimated 1.8 billion people–almost one quarter of the world’s population–lived in fragile states in 2020. This share is expected to grow to 26 percent in 2030 and 31 percent in 2050 (OECD 2020). Moreover, three-quarters of the extreme poor in the world reside in fragile states (OECD 2020). Yet, despite the enormous importance of these areas for reducing global poverty and food insecurity, there is relatively little research on livelihoods and trade because safe and reliable data collection is often a challenge. Access to food, food prices, and the functioning of food value chains are critical when states fail but, insights into the functioning of agricultural markets and food value chains are rare within such conflict-affected areas. In this paper, we examine agricultural value chains in Myanmar during a period of major political instability. Myanmar’s military seized control of the country in a coup on February 1, 2021, setting the country down a path of widespread violence and major economic collapse. In protest of the coup, Myanmar’s people organized a Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) and worker strikes, which led to disruptions in service delivery of both public institutions and private businesses. Banks closed to in-person services and faced severe liquidity shortages, limiting businesses’ ability to pay employees and suppliers, and for residents to access their money. Access to formal and informal credit mostly dried up. Internet access and communication was restricted. Violence and insecurity rose sharply after the coup. Cumulatively, these disruptions had major economic consequences as GDP declined by 18 percent and poverty rates increased to between 40 and 50 percent of Myanmar’s population (Boughton et al. 2021, World Bank 2021, UNDP 2021). We study the rice value chain for two reasons. First, rice is the main staple in Myanmar, accounting for 51 and 62 percent of urban and rural calories consumed, respectively, making it crucial for food security in the country. It is also the predominant crop for a large number of farmers and an important export. Second, approximately 70 percent of rice that is consumed is purchased. Value chains are therefore essential in assuring sales of paddy from farmers, milling of paddy to rice, and distribution of rice to consumers. Rice is typically traded over large distances in the country, implying that coup-related disruptions in the functioning of the value chain coup will be widely felt. To study the rice value chain, we use unique primary data collected by phone before and after the coup at the midstream (rice millers) and downstream (retail food vendors) and combine these data with a number of secondary datasets. We look at three research topics. First, we assess the extent of the disruptions to the rice value chain following the military coup by investigating disruptions midstream and downstream, and rice availability in retail markets. Second, we analyze the size of processing and distribution margins within the value chain and assess how they have been affected by the coup. Third, we look at spatial price dispersion from the mills to food vendors comparing rice prices before and after the coup using a market-pair regression methodology of miller-vendor pairs with miller and vendor fixed effects. We test what explanatory variables of price dispersion used in international literature matter in this context and to what extent these factors have been affected by the instability. We examine travel costs (Minten and Kyle 1999, Minten et al. 2016), border crossings (as a proxy for export market access) (Aker et al. 2014), and differences of ethnic group composition between markets (Aker et al. 2014, Robinson 2016). We also assess the direct effects of measures of violent events in sending and receiving markets on price dispersion. Our data reveal significant business disturbances for food vendors and rice millers after the coup linked to banking and transport. Yet, despite these challenges, local trade and milling continued, though at lower activity levels than normal, assuring availability of rice in most retail markets in the country. Upstream, farm prices and milling margins were found to be mostly stable after the coup. However, we see increases in retail rice prices by 11 percent on average. Simulation results of these increased distribution margins indicate sizable welfare costs for rice consumers and producers, estimated at almost 0.5 billion USD at the national level (equivalent to about 3 percent of agricultural GDP in 2020). Regressions reveal that spatial price dispersion increased after the coup with the distance between mills and vendors widening the price differences. Violence near mills or vendors, which increased dramatically during the coup, also increased price dispersion. However, in contrast with previous findings (Aker et al. 2014, Robinson 2016), we find that differences in ethnic composition of sending and receiving townships/markets did not affect dispersion. Price dispersion further decreased with proximity of food vendors to land borders, possibly due to the price reducing effects of competition from exports in those markets. However, the border effect was weakened severely during periods of border closures. The results indicate that the most severe effect of the coup on retail prices were found in the areas furthest away from export opportunities and major production zones that were affected by violence. When the state fails to assume its normal role and private sector activities are curtailed, it is crucial that agricultural value chains continue to function well to ensure food security and to prevent increases in food retail prices to avoid further suffering of vulnerable households. Our findings indicate that easing transport restrictions, stabilizing fuel prices, and facilitating safe spatial arbitrage of food products would reduce the welfare costs of market disruptions by preventing food price inflation while assuring remunerative prices for farmers. To the extent possible, maintaining safe border trade of agricultural commodities may help stabilize prices in the domestic market. Finally, as mobile phone use is often widespread, even in a failed state, close monitoring of a number of important aspects in such environments can take place and should therefore be encouraged. The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we provide important background information on the political conflict and the rice value chain in Myanmar. The econometric specification used to empirically test price changes during the crisis is discussed in Section 3 along with our data and survey methods. Section 4 illustrates the disruptions noted in the value chain. Section 5 presents graphical analyses of price and margin changes, revealing retail price increases following the coup, as well as price regressions results. Section 6 discusses the implications of our results and section 7 concludes by summarizing the key results and by discussing main policy implications.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/agricultural-value-chains-fragile-state-case-rice-myanmar

Shelter and Non-Food Items",18 Apr 2022,"The volatile situation in Myanmar following the 01 February 2021 coup has resulted in increased armed conflict and subsequent population displacement both within the country and across borders, including into Thailand., Since 17 March, 2,437 Myanmar refugees have crossed into Thailand, according to the Royal Thai Government (RTG). The refugees have sought safety in Umphang and Phop Phra districts, Tak province., Refugees are sheltered in temporary safety areas (TSA), which are placed under the general jurisdiction of the Royal Thai Army in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) established by the RTG in March 2021., SITUATION OVERVIEW ON THE THAI MYANMAR BORDER, In Kayah, clashes have been erupting and escalating since the Karen National Union (KNU) sent a letter to the Tatmadaw on 7 March, demanding the Military withdraw from the KNU controlled area – Brigade 6.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",12 Apr 2022,"In Myanmar, the political and economic crisis following the COVID-19 pandemic and the overthrow of the civilian authorities on Feburary 1st, 2021 has led to an explosion in humanitarian needs., Access to essential goods has become more difficult, and tensions and violence in the country have led to significant population displacement. The shortages observed concern access to food, drinking water, sanitation and hygiene as well as health and education. Hundreds of thousands of people are now extremely vulnerable., The situation could quickly become even more dramatic with the arrival of the dry season: the increased drought that hits the country every year during this period confronts the population with a water scarcity. The water shortages particularly affect the displaced population, including the Rohingya communities living in the camps on the Pauktaw islets in Arakan State., LOGISTICAL CHALLENGE, To meet these critical needs, SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL has been securing water supplies for the Pauktaw camps since 2012. This is a major logistical challenge as the water has to be pumped from a distance, transported by boat and then transferred from the coast to the camps via a pipeline system so that it can be treated and distributed to the population. This requires a great deal of coordination between the different actors involved in these operations. “It is also very important to be able to adapt to daily constraints such as tide times and possible breakdowns,” says Jean-Loup Gouot, country director of the Myanmar mission., Hygiene kits consisting of soap and other essential hygiene products (toothbrushes, toothpaste, detergent, sanitary towels, etc.) are also distributed and awareness-raising sessions on good hygiene practices are held., The NGO’s mobilisation is crucial in that it enables the people it supports to drink drinking water, cook and wash., Our aim is to reduce the risks of spreading diseases and epidemics caused by the ingestion of unsafe water and lack of hygiene,” says Jean-Loup Gouot., It also allows people living in the camps to work., Before, fetching water took a long time because the available water source was far from my home. As the head of the household, I didn’t have enough time to fetch water and work,” says Adumaw Gyi, a resident of Kyein Ni Pyin camp., Access to water remains quantitatively limited. The needs are such that it is sometimes difficult to provide more than 10 litres of water per day per person, half the minimum recommended by the World Health Organisation., FINANCIAL CHALLENGE, Humanitarian actors and donors must respond to emerging needs following the health crisis and the coup, while continuing to meet pre-existing needs., In this context, SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL is having difficulty securing the funds it needs to make its activities possible in the Pauktaw IDP camps in Arakan State, home to more than 23,700 Rohingya, including nearly 6,000 children., The stakes are high and the support of all in this response will allow this population to limit the risk of spreading serious waterborne diseases within the camps (cholera, acute diarrhoea, etc.) but also to better contain the spread of COVID-19. This risk is all the more worrying as the populations concerned have no access to health structures and their freedom of movement is restricted.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-water-shortage-amidst-economic-political-and-health-crisis
Resisting the Resistance: Myanmar’s Pro-military Pyusawhti Militias [EN/ZH],Analysis,ICG,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",6 Apr 2022,"Armed opposition to Myanmar’s coup is spreading, leading the junta to mobilise civilian militias that, in turn, have set off a spate of reprisals. For now, informal justice meted out by local leaders is the best means of stopping the pattern from becoming self-sustaining., What’s new? As anti-coup forces grow stronger in central Myanmar, the military has increasingly relied upon pro-regime networks of armed civilians commonly known as Pyusawhti. This strategy has largely failed, with the Pyusawhti facing stiff resistance and getting limited protection from overstretched security forces., Why does it matter? Although the Pyusawhti have gained little traction, they have received military training, making them more lethal. Their involvement in regime atrocities has put them in the crosshairs of resistance groups, leading to tit-for-tat killings that risk unleashing long-term cycles of communal violence., What should be done? With no hope of quickly restoring law and order, informal justice mechanisms may, despite obvious limitations, be the best hope for constraining escalatory communal violence and providing non-violent means of redress for victims. Preserving the possibility of international accountability through the UN-established Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar will also help., I. Overview Following the Myanmar military’s February 2021 coup d’état, various forms of armed resistance have emerged, alongside peaceful responses. Some of the most persistent and tactically innovative cells are battling soldiers in what is called the Dry Zone, to the west of Mandalay in the Burman Buddhist heartland. In an attempt to quash them, the security forces have turned to networks of pro-military civilians, widely referred to as Pyusawhti, for reinforcements, intelligence and knowledge of the terrain. But this strategy has failed to constrain the resistance movements, instead bringing a wave of attacks on those suspected of pro-regime sentiments or activities, leading to Pyusawhti reprisals. The danger is that this cycle of violence becomes self-sustaining. With no hope of reversing the coup in the near or medium term, informal community justice mechanisms might be the most promising means for preventing the increasingly gruesome tit-for-tat killings by giving victims non-violent means of redress. International justice mechanisms also help by threatening future accountability for atrocities., The Myanmar military, or Defence Services, has a long history of raising militias as part of its counter-insurgency operations, particularly in Myanmar’s uplands, where it has been fighting ethnic armed groups for more than 70 years. Over the decades, it has also mobilised irregular forces – bands of thugs whom it has recruited ad hoc and paid daily wages – to crack down on protesters and political opponents., Following the coup, the junta attempted to use this modus operandi to quell the nationwide resistance movements. But the generals learned early on that the coup’s unpopularity made ad hoc recruiting difficult, and so the military changed its approach. In the Dry Zone and other parts of the Burman Buddhist heartland where they face stubborn and effective armed resistance, the security forces turned to pro-military Pyusawhti networks for back-up, intelligence and knowledge of local geography., The original Pyusawhti groups arose out of a government militia-forming strategy in the 1950s, and were named after a semi-mythical warrior-king from the Burmese chronicles. The emergence of Pyusawhti militias today, however, appears to have a different backstory. Today’s groups evolved out of pre-existing local networks consisting of individuals who are ideologically pro-regime, as well as others – such as members of the military-established Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) – who fear being targeted by the resistance, whether or not they actively support the junta. Security forces are providing these networks with basic training and rudimentary weapons. While the military is stretched too thin to protect them from retaliation, it regularly launches revenge attacks when anti-coup resistance cells hit Pyusawhti groups., The military’s attempt to use the Pyusawhti against anti-coup forces has foundered, however, due to the strength of anti-regime sentiment, the risk of reprisal against those who do sign up has increased. The pro-regime militias, if anything, may have deepened popular hatred of the regime with their involvement in reported atrocities and their campaign against the resistance. That victims of violence on both sides have neither effective state protection nor legal recourse augments their inclination to take matters into their own hands, leading to tit-for-tat reprisals and the potential for greater escalation. Myanmar’s judicial system independence was badly compromised to begin with, and following the coup broke down completely, depriving individuals of what protection they had beforehand., Responsibility for this sad state of affairs lies squarely with the regime, not only for mounting the coup and dispensing with what existed of the rule of law, but also for unleashing horrific violence on civilians thereafter. Nonetheless, resistance forces must also take responsibility for the actions of their members, some of whom have also committed what appear to be crimes. The National Unity Government, a parallel administration created by ousted lawmakers after the coup, has issued guidance and rules of engagement for resistance fighters, but it cannot hope to police the behaviour of the many different groups spread across the country., The best remedy for the situation – to reverse the coup and restore a modicum of law and order across the country – is not on the cards for the foreseeable future. Against this backdrop, outside actors should continue to focus on denying political legitimacy to the junta, targeting sanctions at the military and its business interests, preventing the flow of arms to the regime, and engaging closely with the National Unity Government and other legitimate representatives of Myanmar’s peoples, including the Rohingya., As for Pyusawhti-related violence, the bodies within Myanmar that may be best positioned to make inroads are informal justice mechanisms. These structures, which rely on the authority of community elders and religious figures, have an important role in dispute resolution and conflict mitigation in Myanmar, and could help provide victims with non-violent means of redress and thus help stop cycles of revenge from spinning out of control. The turbulent post-coup environment has tended to limit the ability of these figures to constrain violence, but over time they could regain their traditional influence. International bodies such as the UN-established Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar can also assist by looking into post-coup atrocities and collecting information that enables future efforts to hold perpetrators to account.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/resisting-resistance-myanmar-s-pro-military-pyusawhti-militias-enzh

Networks for Peace,News and Press Release,USAID,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,8 Apr 2022,"Identity-based violence and hate speech are rising in South and Southeast Asia. Yet actors working to address these issues often do so in isolation and/or lack support to magnify their impact. Networks for Peace uses its regional convening power to collectively engage and support civil society organizations and key influencers in advancing tolerance and peaceful coexistence, mitigating growing polarization of ethnic and religious identities across the region., Working with partners in Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and with the Central Tibetan Administration, Networks for Peace fosters intra- and interfaith harmony and social cohesion through grants, capacity building, research, and regional knowledge sharing., STRENGTHENING ORGANIZATIONS AND REGIONAL NETWORKS, Networks for Peace’s regional approach focuses on strengthening organizational capacity while providing networking opportunities for a broad range of civil society organizations and key influencers, including women, youth, religious actors, faith-based organizations, and the private sector. Networks for Peace activities focus on: (i) promoting intra- and interfaith harmony; (2) addressing dangerous speech and amplifying positive narratives of peace and inclusivity; and (3) promoting regional youth champions to foster greater understanding and tolerance among different ethnic and religious communities. Additionally, Networks for Peace programming integrates key elements of USAID’s Women, Peace, and Security strategy empowering women and marginalized groups through inclusion and meaningful participation in activities., EXPANDING KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING, Networks for Peace is expanding civil society organizations’ access to evidence-based research, knowledge, tools, and resources to better understand religious nationalism and promote religious tolerance in South and Southeast Asia. By enhancing partners’ access to learning resources, Networks for Peace enables regional partners and stakeholders to design and implement more strategic interventions improving the effectiveness of their advocacy and peacebuilding efforts., KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS, Networks for Peace held consultations with over 200 organizations and key influencers across Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and the Central Tibetan Administration and Tibetans in exile in India to better understand the context related to ethnic and religious conflict across each country and explore avenues to effectively promote peace and inclusivity., Networks for Peace regional exchanges provided critical forums for 208 civil society representatives and key influencers (60 percent women) to share experiences and best practices across multiple countries on issues such as interfaith and intrafaith dialogue, the role of women and youth in peacebuilding, and addressing online misinformation and dangerous speech., Since 2020, Networks for Peace has trained 146 persons (64 percent women) to advance gender equality or female empowerment through their roles in public or private sector institutions or organizations. Since then, 211 local women have participated substantively in Networks for Peace regional and in-country activities., Networks for Peace employs a Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) lens to ensure that women and marginalized groups are empowered and meaningfully included in all aspects of its partner networks’ operations. With Networks for Peace guidance, a regional network was able to incorporate GESI principles in the selection of its project participants. This led to a more inclusive and diverse group of regional peacebuilder participants, comprised of Buddhist monks, female clergies, and representatives from marginalized groups., Networks for Peace regional events, workshops, and grants have supported in-country and cross-border collaboration among organizations working to promote intra- and interfaith harmony and address dangerous speech. For example, following their participation in a Networks for Peace activity, a tech company in Burma and a Sri Lankan civil society organization have explored areas for collaboration and are now jointly implementing a project to adapt an existing dangerous speech monitoring platform. In Thailand, through their participation in Networks for Peace partnership building exchanges, three Thai private tech companies and a local civil society organization are establishing a Dangerous Speech Monitoring and Mitigation Network to coordinate their respective activities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/networks-peace

It covers COVID-19 vaccinations, livelihood issues, school closures, and State Administration Council (SAC) activities. Some villagers received COVID-19 vaccines from the SAC authorities, while others are still waiting to receive vaccinations from the Karen Department of Health and Welfare (KDHW). The increase in the price of food and other products has presented local villagers with more livelihood challenges. A recent road widening project in T’Nay Hsah Township by ethnic armed groups damaged civilian farmland, creating further livelihood challenges for some villagers. Since the coup, Karen Education and Culture Department (KECD) schools have remained open as usual, whereas SAC-run schools have been closed. The SAC also transported their rations to Mu Traw District in civilian trucks and while wearing civilian clothing.[1], COVID-19 vaccinations, Some of the villagers in T'Nay Hsah (Nabu) and Ta Kreh (Paingkyon) townships, Hpa-an District have already received COVID-19 vaccinations that were provided by State Administration Council (SAC)[2] authorities. However, there were also many villagers who did not dare get vaccinated [by the SAC authorities]. During the last week of January, healthcare workers from the Karen Department of Health and Welfare (KDHW) took note of the population numbers in each village for vaccination purposes and they will start providing voluntary vaccinations in June 2022. Some of the villagers said that even though they did not want to get the vaccines that the SAC authorities provided, they had to get it because travel is restricted in the local area for those who are not vaccinated. [When travelling to towns or cities, villagers would be questioned and asked to show a vaccination certificate if stopped by the SAC.] Villagers in T’Nay Hsah Township are no longer worried about COVID-19 as it has been a while since it [the pandemic] started and they have become used to it., Livelihoods, Villagers in Ta Kreh Township reported that local travel has become more difficult and livelihoods have been affected due to the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic and the post-coup situation. Local villagers have been facing financial issues because the prices of food and other products have increased. In this situation, it has been more challenging for local villagers to earn their livelihood., Some of the villagers along the western part of Taw Naw Mountain in T’Nay Hsah Township faced livelihood challenges because they did not have any farmland to work on. Those who have farms grow rice during the rainy season and peanuts in the summer. They use the wages they earn from their cash crops to provide for the needs of their family, including buying food., In the third week of December 2021, road construction was carried out by local authorities and ethnic armed groups in T'Nay Hsah Township, including the Karen National Union (KNU)[3], Border Guard Force (BGF)[4] and the KNU/KNLA-Peace Council (KNU/KNLA-PC)[5]. They widened the road to 40 feet [12.2 metres] [double its previous width], damaging many civilians’ farmlands. [No consultation or consent from the villagers was undertaken prior to the road construction.], Some young people who used to be migrant workers in Bangkok, Thailand cannot travel back there [to Thailand] as easily as before [the COVID-19 pandemic and coup]. This situation has made it more challenging for them to secure their livelihood. Civilians in T’Nay Hsah Township are also living in fear of potential fighting between the SAC and Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[6] in the local area., Education, In Ta Kreh Township, the SAC-run schools have been closed since the military coup and only Karen Education and Culture Department (KECD)[7] schools remain open. Due to the closure of some schools, some students got married at a very young age [age 13-17] and some are doing nothing with their time [are not working or earning money for the family]. Students in the K’Ser Ghee Htee area, Ta Kreh Township could still go to school as local KECD schools are open., SAC activities, The local villagers in Ta Kreh Township observed that SAC soldiers were wearing civilian clothing and using civilian cars when transporting rations to Mu Traw District. They used the road that goes to Htee Poe Hkler village for this activity., Further background reading on the security situation and human rights violations in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, “Hpa-an District Situation Update: the Civil Disobedience Movement, COVID-19 and education, April to June 2021”, February 2022., “Taw Oo District Short Update: Killing, shelling, displacement, and the destruction of a COVID-19 screening checkpoint and villagers’ belongings by SAC soldiers, March 2022”, March 2022., “Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: Ongoing fighting in Bilin Township leads to more than 2,000 IDPs, as well as injury and property damage, December 21st 2021 to January 11th 2022”, March 2022., Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in February 2022.

It was established by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on February 2nd 2021, and is composed of eight military officers and eight civilians. The chairperson serves as the de facto head of government of Myanmar and leads the Military Cabinet of Myanmar, the executive branch of the government. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of SAC chairperson following the coup., [3] The Karen National Union (KNU) is the main Karen political organisation. It was established in 1947 and has been in conflict with the Burma/Myanmar government since 1949. The KNU wields power across large areas of Southeast Myanmar and has been calling for the creation of a democratic federal system since 1976. Although it signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement in 2015, relations with the government remain tense., [4] Border Guard Force (BGF) battalions of the Tatmadaw were established in 2010, and they are composed mostly of soldiers from former non-state armed groups, such as older constellations of the DKBA, which have formalised ceasefire agreements with the Burma/Myanmar government and agreed to transform into battalions within the Tatmadaw., [5] The KNU/KNLA-PC is an armed group based in the Htoh Kaw Koh village tract area, Hpa-an District. It split from the Karen National Union (KNU) and signed a ceasefire agreement with the Myanmar government in 2007, but refused to transform into a Border Guard Force (BGF) in 2010. It signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement in October 2015., [6] The Karen National Liberation Army is the armed wing of the Karen National Union., [7] The Karen Education and Culture Department is the education department of the Karen National Union.

At least 1 primary school and several businesses within Tari have closed. Road access to Tari is currently blocked by both the parties to the conflict and the police. The violence appears to be related to an ongoing cycle of revenge killings between two tribes. The police officers were reportedly attacked by armed men while trying to negotiate a cease fire and initiate a peace dialogue. The situation remains tense at the time of reporting. In February 2021, the Disaster Management Team (DMT) mobilized a humanitarian response to address the needs of over 2,900 people displaced by conflict in Tari. Hela is considered one of three very-high-risk provinces for increasing violence during the upcoming national electionx. The Government is planning to deploy additional security forces to the region in advance of the election period, which begins with the issuing of writs on 28 April and continues through the end of July with the counting of ballots., PHILIPPINES, On 3 April, the Taal Volcano 90 km south of Manila recorded seventeen volcanic earthquakes, including four volcanic tremor events and thirteen low-frequency volcanic earthquakes. Activity at the main crater was dominated by upwelling of hot volcanic fluids in its lake which generated plumes 900 meters tall that drifted southwest. On March 26, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) had raised an Alert Level for the Taal Volcano from 2 to 3 following an increase in eruptive activity. Over 10,000 people (3,068 families) have been affected and 1,535 families were evacuated to 25 evacuations centers. Government agencies and the Philippine Red Cross have distributed food packs and other necessities to affected families., MYANMAR, The humanitarian situation in Myanmar’s northwest continues to deteriorate due to the escalation of armed clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and local People’s Defence Forces (PDF) and the Chinland Defense Forces (CDF) across Chin State, Magway and Sagaing regions. The number of internally displaced people (IDPs) in the northwest has significantly increased over the past week, exceeding 300,000 for the first time. In Sagaing Region, approximately 31,000 new IDPs in Kawlin, Kalay and Wuntho townships were recently verified. In Chin State, about 1,500 people from Kanpetlet Township were displaced. Displacement numbers are expected to increase as security operations and armed clashes continue. At least 7,246 houses and other civilian properties, including churches and monasteries, have reportedly been either burnt down or destroyed in northwest Myanmar since 1 February 2021.
Humanitarian access to conflict-affected and displaced people remains heavily restricted and there are significant gaps in assistance to these communities despite efforts by humanitarian partners and local organizations. Advocacy efforts continue in an effort to secure access and delivery assistance to people in need across the northwest., Nationwide, as of 28 March, it is estimated that 904,600 people remain displaced, including 558,000 people who fled their homes as a result of conflict and insecurity since the military takeover.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/asia-and-pacific-weekly-regional-humanitarian-snapshot-29-march-4-april-2022

Protection and Human Rights",31 Mar 2022,"This Short Update describes events that occurred in Bilin Township, Doo Tha Htoo (Thaton) District during the period between September 14th to 25th 2021. It covers the military activities and human rights violations committed by the State Administration Council (SAC) military and Border Guard Force (BGF) troops under BGF Battalion #1013, which operate in the area between Lay Kay and Yoh Klah army camps. The SAC and BGF committed human rights violations such as the imposition of forced portering, the use of civilians as human shields, theft, looting and other threats against local civilians while sending rations and rotating troops between their army camps in Bilin Township.[1], SAC and BGF activities, Between September 14th and 20th 2021, about 24 soldiers from the State Administration Council (SAC)[2] military along with about 22 Border Guard Force (BGF)[3] soldiers travelled from Lay Kay army camp to Yoh Klah army camp. They passed through Karen National Union (KNU)[4] territory without receiving permission from the KNU. The BGF troops are from BGF Battalion #1013 led by Battalion Commander Bo[5] Hla Kyaing, which has been operating in the area between Lay Kay and Yoh Klah army camps. The battalion number of the SAC troops could not be identified by local villagers. The SAC and BGF troops went to Yoh Klah army camp to bring more rations and to rotate BGF troops in BGF Battalion #1013 already at Yoh Klah camp. The head [officer] at Yoh Klah army camp is Bo Wa Soe. At Yoh Klah army camp, the majority of the soldiers are with the BGF and only a few (two or three) are actually SAC soldiers. In travelling between Lay Kay and Yoh Klah army camps, the SAC and BGF had to pass by several towns and villages such as Kyaik Kaw Town, A---, O---, H--- and L--- villages. They departed Lay Kay army camp on September 14th 2021., According to the local villagers, the BGF at Yoh Klah army camp engage in regular troop rotations every 45 days, and the SAC soldiers accompany them during their troop rotations. Before August 2021, the SAC and BGF travelled along the vehicle road from K’Ter Tee Town and Baw Kyoh Leh village to Yoh Klah army camp, but since August the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[6] has blocked [prevented use of] the road by attacking any BGF and SAC troops that carry out their operations in KNLA territory [the KNLA had already told the BGF and SAC troops not to use the road, but that demand had been ignored]. Therefore, as of August 2021, the SAC and BGF started travelling on the local unpaved roads from Lay Kay army camp to Yoh Klah army camp. In doing so, the SAC and BGF also began forcibly recruiting porters, navigators and [using civilians as] human shields whenever they do troop rotations., Forced portering, human shields and villager insecurity, a. From Lay Kay to Yoh Klah army camp, On September 14th 2021, the SAC and BGF travelled from Lay Kay to Kyaik Kaw and P’Ya Raw by military truck. The SAC and BGF stopped at A--- village for several days and then continued their trip to O--- village on September 17th 2021. During that time, they forced local villagers from A--- village to send the rations using their own tractors, five in total [according to some reports received by KHRG], to O--- village without paying the tractor owners., On September 17th 2021, when the SAC and BGF arrived at O--- village, the SAC and BGF ordered the KNU village tract[7] administrator of O--- village tract to send rations for them by boat. The KNU village tract administrator did not feel safe to do so because the local KNLA are likely to attack the SAC and BGF [for trespassing into KNU territory]. Therefore, the village tract administrator decided to flee from the village to another place. In response, the SAC and BGF arrested his wife that day in order to force the village tract administrator to return to the village and accept sending rations for them. However, he did not return., Even though the SAC and BGF did not harm the KNU village tract administrator’s wife, the SAC and BGF kept pressuring her to send rations for the SAC and BGF. As a result, on September 18th 2021, 107 O--- villagers had to carry the rations for the SAC and BGF to H--- village in order that the SAC and BGF release the village tract administrator’s wife. According to Saw[8] E---, a villager from nearby L--- village, they transported the rations on foot because of the added danger of doing so by boat: “[I]f the food [rations] are sent by boat, their enemies [the KNLA] might shoot the boats and the boats will sink [with the boat owners on the boats]. So, the village tract administrator’s wife chose for the villagers to carry the food [on foot].”, Based on a discussion with local villagers, there were 105 sacks of rice and other food such as canned fish, canned milk as well as some ammunition. Due to the large amount of rations and the weight of the load, 107 villagers were required to carry the rations. It took two round trips in total between O--- and H--- villages on foot. One villager from H--- village, Htee Hpa Doh Hta village tract, Bilin Township, stated: “Since the rice sacks are big, some rice sacks were carried by three people (per sack) and some were carried by two people. Two men [were needed to carry] one sack and three women [were needed to carry] one sack.”, While staying in O--- village, the SAC and BGF also confiscated [stole] villagers’ ducks for meat, but villagers do not know the exact number of ducks stolen by the SAC and BGF., Before the SAC and BGF (along with the villagers) arrived at H--- village, the local KNLA attacked the SAC and BGF twice; one time at Kreh Koe Place and one time in the jungle outside of H--- village. However, the KNLA just shot one or two times per attack so it did not cause any injuries and all villagers who were walking amongst the SAC and BGF troops were safe. The KNLA have strictly prohibited the operation of the SAC and BGF in KNU territory, and are ready to attack when the SAC and BGF disregard KNU demands. On this occasion, according to an interviewee, the KNLA clearly did not launch a full-on attack on the SAC and BGF due to the presence of villagers walking amongst them., The SAC and BGF arrived at H--- village on September 18th 2021 and slept at H--- monastery two nights. On the evening of September 19th 2021, the KNLA attacked the SAC and BGF soldiers when they came to buy goods at the shop of one of the villagers, Naw[9] Y---. The incident took place in front of the shop. The SAC and BGF soldiers discriminately fired guns around the shop. One of the soldiers [not clear whether SAC or BGF] died during the incident but no villagers were injured. In response, the SAC and BGF entered into the village angrily, searching [for KNLA soldiers], shot at the shop and almost burned it down. According to H--- villager Naw C---, a female village head who has been serving the village for some time shouted at the SAC and BGF soldiers without fear, stating: *“You can’t burn the shop because it is not the fault of the shopkeeper. It is your soldiers’ fault [that they were shot] because they did not carry guns while they walk [entered into the shop] and you could not control them [they were not behaving properly]. It is not right to burn our village because people [the KNLA] shot your fellow.” Naw C--- continued: “If she [the village head] didn’t yell at him, they [the SAC and BGF] would have actually burned down the shop, and if they burned the shop, the whole village would burn down.” * Although the SAC and BGF [did not burn down the shop, they] confiscated food and materials from the shop, including a phone and money. The villagers do not know how much money they confiscated., Since the fighting happened in the village, the shopkeepers [a married couple] and most of the male villagers have fled the village. Men are typically the most at risk of abuse by the SAC and BGF. Therefore, most of the villagers who have remained are women, children and the elderly. One of the villagers, Naw C--- from H--- village, explained why men were fleeing but not women: “Usually, men are likely to get killed [by the SAC/BGF]. [In the past] they would point guns at the men and say: ‘Go and help find [KNLA soldiers] for us. You live here but you don’t know where the [KNLA] soldiers stay?’ Then they would shoot them [male villagers for not providing information]. But they are a little bit softer on women. Since there are women who don’t have the strength to walk, women who are sick and women who have babies, they [the soldiers] might arrest [for forced labour] only around five women out of ten women. But women also have to worry for their security. Yesterday, they brought a female villager [as a porter/ human shield] along with them to here [into the village].”, On September 25th 2021, the female shopkeeper, Naw Y---, returned to the village, but her husband has not returned to the village yet. When the SAC and BGF were based in the village, they confiscated two chickens from villagers [for meat]. They were also drinking alcohol and threatened to burn down the village if the KNLA attack them. Villagers who have remained in the village feel greater insecurity and are worried the SAC and BGF will engage in indiscriminate shelling and other forms of human rights violations. Women, children and the elderly have been deeply concerned for their safety since men are absent from the village, but they do not know where to flee to be safe so they take the risk of remaining in the village. As of yet, there have been no incidents regarding sexual violence against women and girls, but the fear of sexual violence is present, especially among older villagers concerning their daughters due to trauma from past experiences of sexual violence committed by the Myanmar military [under previous military regimes]. In the words of Naw C---, “We have to worry while living in the village. That [risk of sexual violence] is why we are really scared. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to flee even if I want to flee. […] We really have to worry and are scared about it [sexual violence]. I will not let my daughter go [for portering], I will go myself.”, On the morning of September 20th 2021, BGF soldiers ordered villagers from H---, O--- and W---villages to carry rations as well as some ammunition for them as they continued on to Yoh Klah army camp. Close to 300 villagers in total (180 from H--- village and 100 from L--- village), including men, women, children, the elderly and sick people, had to carry rations and ammunition for them. The majority of the villagers required to serve as porters were women, and another 12 were underage (nine girls and three boys). The men were fewer in number because some were busy working for their family’s livelihood and others had fled to other places. According to Naw R---, who was herself forced into portering: “I went because my husband is not home. When I returned home, my legs were in pain. It was so painful.” They started travelling from H--- village at 10:30 am and arrived at Yoh Klah army camp at 12:30 pm (thus a two-hour walk each way) under extremely hot conditions. They also did not receive any food or drink along the way. Naw R--- added that there were crowded together while portering so they do not exactly know how many types of materials they had to carry. As far as she could tell, some villagers had to carry rations such as rice and canned fish while others had to carry ammunition such as mortars. The SAC and BGF soldiers walked between the villagers along the way to Yoh Klah army camp. There were no attacks by the KNLA [on this portion of the journey] so villagers were able to return home safely., The SAC and BGF used the villagers not only as porters but as human shields to protect themselves from attack by the local KNLA while travelling from A--- village to Yoh Klah army camp. Saw E--- from L--- village, Yoh Klah village tract, Bilin Township, stated: “The KNU doesn’t give them permission [to enter into KNU territory]; therefore, they [SAC and BGF] arrested [used] the villagers to shield them [from attack].”, Villagers were afraid to refuse the orders of the SAC and BGF as Saw E--- explained: “The villagers didn’t dare to complain. If they complain, they might get shot with a gun. […] or be arrested.” In addition, the SAC and BGF staying in the village meant increased security risk [of abuse and rights violations] for the villagers and increased possibility of continual fighting with the local KNLA. Local villager, Naw R---, explained that villagers agreed to send rations for the SAC and BGF because they hoped it would allow the soldiers to leave their area: “Yes, we tried to get rid of them that way [by portering] because if they stay in the village, people [the KNLA] will attack them in the village. We sent them [carried rations] to another place. Actually, none of us wanted to carry things for them.”, Villagers were also afraid of the spread of COVID-19 because the SAC and BGF soldiers were from other communities [and thus could be carriers of the virus]. Additionally, some of the villagers who were required to be porters were already experiencing the symptoms of COVID-19. According to Naw R---: “Many people with nasal congestion (like, lost sense of smell) and other illnesses had to go [for portering]. We do not know whether they were infected with the flu or Coronavirus. For instance, one of the female villagers had just taken an injection [to ease flu or COVID-19 symptoms] the night before and then the next morning had to carry things [porter]. […] Now, the disease is already spreading in the whole village where I live.”, b. From Yoh Klah army camp to Lay Kay army camp, On September 24th 2021, the same SAC troops, along with BGF, returned to Lay Kay army camp from Yoh Klah army camp, taking the same road. There were about 50 soldiers in total. The SAC and BGF arrested three O--- villagers and five H-- villagers, some of whom were women, to use as human shields while travelling from L--- village to H--- village. Naw C--- from H--- village explained: “They [SAC and BGF] didn’t dare to go back by themselves. That is why they brought along two to three villagers and walked between villagers like that. It is because they worry that they will be ambushed. By walking amongst the villagers, if they are ambushed, those villagers will get shot instead of them.”, Before the SAC and BGF arrived at H--- village with the eight villagers, the SAC and BGF were ambushed by the local KNLA in a jungle outside of L--- village. According to Naw C---, *“*We fled randomly [scattered] when we heard the gunshots from here [the village]. One of the villagers, Saw M---, said that while he was fleeing from the SAC [and BGF], he encountered Myanmar soldiers and was taken [for use as a human shield]. He said that there were a lot of gunshots [while he was fleeing] but the bullets just missed hitting him in the head.” Fortunately, all villagers were safe. Two SAC soldiers got minor injuries., After the fighting, the SAC and BGF arrested anyone they saw on their way to be a human shield while travelling from the eastern part of H--- village to the H--- monastery. They also forcibly apprehended some villagers who were hiding inside their bunkers and under their houses during the skirmishes. The SAC soldiers fired guns in the village and the SAC commanders encouraged their soldiers to shoot villagers on sight in the village. According to Naw C---, “If they [SAC and BGF] couldn’t call [order] them [villagers to accompany them], they [SAC and BGF] would shoot at them [in the direction of villagers and their living spaces]. Their captain told them that ‘if you shoot them, don’t shoot astray. Just shoot them straight on]. Shoot them to death [shoot to kill].’ So, the female H--- village head, Naw P--- approached them and told them that it is not right to shoot us dead. […] While he [the SAC commander] came back beside my home, villagers fled when they saw them [SAC and BGF soldiers]. Then his [the commander’s] subordinates [soldiers] shot at the villagers indirectly. So, he [SAC commander] ordered them: “Don’t shoot astray. Just shoot straight on. Shoot them to death.”” According to one villager, Naw C---, the BGF soldiers were also patrolling with the SAC and they saw the SAC reacted violently toward villagers, but they were quiet [did not stop them] because they are under the command of the SAC., The SAC and BGF reaction frightened the local civilians, including children. As Naw C---, one of the villagers who was forced to porter, explained: *“I do not know how to describe this feeling. We are in extreme fear now and we shit ourselves [because we were so afraid].” *Another villager Yaw Cher added: “One of the Muga [villagers], Naw B---, her poo [feces] came out under her sarong when SAC ordered her to follow them so the SAC soldiers told her, ‘You go back Muga, I cannot handle [the smell of your poo] anymore.’”, Naw C--- also informed KHRG that the elderly were forced to porter: “Another older male villager, Saw U---, told me that the SAC and BGF ordered him to follow them too. I asked him, ‘What did they [SAC and BGF] do to you? How did they release you?’ He replied, ‘I did not do anything. I was too tired to walk with them, so I just stopped walking and had to breathe out from my mouth. I took a rest beside the road and then the SAC and BGF soldiers passed me one by one until they were gone, so I was able to go home.’ He is old and he is already over 70 years old so could not walk well anymore. They [SAC and BGF] also ordered me to follow them too and they told me just to follow them half way.”, According to Naw C---, the behaviour of these SAC and BGF troops was worse than that of State Peace and Development Council (SPDC)[10] soldiers. In describing SAC and BGF cruelty, Naw C--- stated: *“We always have to be afraid due to the coup. […] We worry that they will burn the village or kill people [civilians]. They might kill us if someone [KNLA] shoots at them. This group of Myanmar soldiers that came into the village is not like the Myanmar soldiers that came into the village in the past [before the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA)[11]]. They are like rabid dogs. […] They will bite everything they see. […]They are not like the soldiers who have undergone training. When they came into the village, they randomly shot guns a lot as if they were getting free guns to shoot.” *, Due to the attack on September 24th 2021, the SAC and BGF troops temporarily set up base in H--- village at H--- monastery [instead of continuing on to Lay Kay army camp]. Therefore, H---villagers continue to worry for their security and fear that the SAC and BGF will force them to be human shields for their return through O--- village, A--- village and then to Lay Kay army camp., Livelihoods, Villagers in Bilin Township, Doo Tha Htoo District reported to KHRG that they have been facing travel restrictions by the SAC and BGF authorities since the February 1st 2021 coup so they face difficulties accessing food from outside of the village and from town, like Kyaik Kaw. The following SAC and BGF army camps are based in the area between H--- village and Kyaik Kaw Town, and are located along the vehicle road: P’Nweh Klah, Way Raw and Lay Kay army camps. The SAC and BGF also do not allow villagers to pass by their army camps. In fact, they shoot any villagers who pass in front of their army camp by car or motorbike, so villagers are afraid to go to town to get food. Naw C--- from H--- village, Htee Hpa Doh Hta village tract, Bilin Township, explained: “We usually buy food from Kyaik Kaw Town. Now, the road is blocked by several [SAC] checkpoints, so we can’t go anywhere. The shopkeepers cannot go to buy things in town as well. The roads are blocked in many parts [by checkpoints], so we cannot go anymore. If we pass in front of P’Nweh Klah army camp with our motorbike, we will get shot at [by SAC soldiers]. We don’t dare to walk on foot either, so we just have to stay like this. The food in the shops in the village is about to run out. If the food runs out, we will starve. Help us quickly if you [stakeholders] can help. We would like the armed conflicts to be over quickly.”, Naw C--- spoke of villagers’ fear of the soldiers and their activities, and the impact on villagers’ security and livelihood: “Right now, we still have rice and oil from last year’s harvest. But there will be no rice and oil left by next year. We will all die if no one helps us since the conflicts might still continue to happen. […] We cannot go to work [on our farms] anymore because we cannot go anywhere. People, especially strong males [including teenagers] are fleeing now [out of fear]. This season [time of year] is the season to plough sesame. But people don’t dare to go plough. People are hiding in their bunkers and waiting for the situation [to improve]. If we hear fighting, we all have to flee. They [SAC and BGF] will arrest anyone whom they catch. […] We don’t even dare to move. I am really scared; I cannot handle that fear anymore and I really want to flee but I don’t know where to flee. Could I flee to you [to where the KHRG researcher is]?”, Demands and recommendations, Local villagers in Bilin Township, Doo Tha Htoo District expressed the desire for their voices to be heard by international stakeholders and the United Nations, and for all civilians to be under the protection of international human rights law. They want there to be an end to the armed conflict in their communities, the opportunity for them to enjoy their full human rights and freedom of movement, to be free from fear and from violations by the SAC and BGF. A local villager, Saw E--- from L--- village, Yoh Klah village tract, Bilin Township stated: “[E]ven though there is law, none of it is for us [protects us], so we always have to worry for [the security of] our children and ourselves. […] [A]s a civilian, I would like to say one more thing: that the law should be for [the protection of] the civilians, but now, it is not for the civilians. Since there is no law for the civilians, we now have to be scared of each other [of other humans, since SAC soldiers are also humans]. […] [I]t is an important message for the United Nations to hear.”, Further background reading on the human rights situation in Doo Tha Htoo District in Southeast Myanmar can be found in the following KHRG reports:, Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in August 2021.

The parts in square brackets are explanations added by KHRG., [2] The State Administration Council (SAC) is the executive governing body created in the aftermath of the February 1st 2021 military coup. It was established by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on February 2nd 2021, and is composed of eight military officers and eight civilians. The chairperson serves as the de facto head of government of Myanmar and leads the Military Cabinet of Myanmar, the executive branch of the government. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of SAC chairperson following the coup., [3] Border Guard Force (BGF) battalions of the Tatmadaw were established in 2010, and they are composed mostly of soldiers from former non-state armed groups, such as older constellations of the DKBA, which have formalised ceasefire agreements with the Burma/Myanmar government and agreed to transform into battalions within the Tatmadaw., [4] The Karen National Union (KNU) is the main Karen political organisation. It was established in 1947 and has been in conflict with the Burma/Myanmar government since 1949. The KNU wields power across large areas of Southeast Myanmar and has been calling for the creation of a democratic federal system since 1976.

It followed the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) which ruled from 1988 until its dissolution in 1997. The SPDC was officially dissolved on March 30th 2011 by Senior General Than Shwe following the election of a quasi-civilian government in Burma/Myanmar in November 2010., [11] On October 15th 2015, after a negotiation process marred with controversy over the non-inclusion of several ethnic armed groups, a Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) was signed between the Burma/Myanmar government and eight of the fifteen ethnic armed groups originally invited to the negotiation table, including the Karen National Union. It was followed by the adoption of a Code of Conduct by the signatories in November 2015. In February 2018, two additional armed ethnic groups signed the NCA under pressure from the Burma/Myanmar government.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/doo-tha-htoo-district-short-update-forced-portering-and-use-civilians-human-shields

Water Sanitation Hygiene",2 Apr 2022,"SITUATION OVERVIEW, The people of Myanmar are dealing with an evolving humanitarian crisis where humanitarian needs have continued to escalate since the third wave of COVID-19 in 2021 and the ongoing political unrest since Myanmar’s military intervention on 1 February 2021., The country is now entering the second year of this crisis, where ongoing inter-factional tensions have fueled its complexity and multi-dimensional characteristics. The Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) continues to be supported by many in Myanmar, impacting public services, including health, schools, and government administrations in states and regions across the country., Clashes and targeted attacks between various armed actors, including the People’s Defence Forces (PDFs), ethnic armed organizations (EAOs), and the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF), continue and have intensified in several states/regions. Simmering historical tensions exist across certain key states, and, in some locations, these tensions have become exacerbated as a consequence of military intervention. Numerous new forces have emerged, and several ethnic armed groups, established many years before the military intervention, have become increasingly recommitted to the insurgency resulting in fighting occurring in areas that have been without conflict for decades., Some sources have recorded nearly 13,000 political violence and protest events throughout 2021. The degree of violence against civilians has been severe. The number of casualties has increased, while thousands of houses and the properties of other civilians have been burnt down or destroyed. This has triggered multiple large scale population displacements. As of 28 February 2022, roughly 873,000 people have been internally displaced in Myanmar. About 502,600 people have been displaced by insecurity and the increased vulnerability of host and resident communities in affected areas since 1 February 2021. The northwest part of Myanmar (Sagaing, Magway and Chin) has recorded the highest level of new internal displacements, with 246,600 internally displaced persons (IDPs) (49 per cent), followed by the southeast part of Myanmar (Kayin, Kayah, and Shan) with 233,600 IDPs contributing 46.5 per cent. Displaced populations face significant challenges in access to basic needs and services, specifically, food, healthcare, shelter materials, clean water, and sanitation facilities., Myanmar is also experiencing a socio-economic crisis exacerbated by the protracted COVID-19 epidemic. The local currency, the Kyat, has fluctuated with a significant drop in value by 60 per cent in the month of September 2021, while costs for food items, fuel, and other essential goods have soared. In September 2021, inflation increased to 7.3 per cent. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that in 2021, some 1.6 million jobs were lost, leaving only 18.9 million women and men employed. The farming, construction, garment, tourism, and hospitality industries are among the hardest hit. The economic and political volatility is projected to have driven almost half of the population into poverty in 2022., The 2022 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) for Myanmar, which was published on 31 December 2021, predicts that approximately a quarter of the population (14.4 million people – 4.9 million women and five million children) will be classified as requiring humanitarian support during 2022, up from about one million people in need before February 2021. This increase is driven by the social, economic and health impacts of COVID-19, worsening food insecurity, and the mass movement of the population since the events of 1 February 2021 and subsequent need for protection. These factors have generated an array of new needs and exacerbated the vulnerability of specific groups., The HNO analysis estimated that 14 out of 15 states and regions in Myanmar are now within the critical threshold for acute malnutrition. Prices for key commodities in some states and regions have increased significantly, resulting in some food items no longer being affordable to many families. At the beginning of 2022, fuel prices increased by 14-18 per cent from the previous month. Compared to the pre-crisis period through to March 2022, fuel prices skyrocketed by 82-150 per cent, impacting transportation costs and contributing to unpredictable commodity prices., Humanitarian access to reach conflict-affected populations remains a major challenge for the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) and other humanitarian organizations. Travel restrictions are currently in place due to the security context, military checkpoints, stringent administrative authorization requirements, and COVID-19 regulations., This has impacted the distribution of humanitarian resources, direct support from personnel and disrupted monitoring and evaluation activities, including data collection and verification. Several private companies have withdrawn and/or halted services in Myanmar, which has impacted transportation, the supply chain, and costs, eventually delaying humanitarian assistance from reaching those most in need., With continuous dialogue and advocacy efforts with all stakeholders and state administrators, the MRCS gradually secured safe access to wider vulnerable populations. This engagement is based on autonomous Red Cross Red Crescent-led needs assessments and a decision-making process that supports independent humanitarian action. The MRCS collaborates with both International Red Cross Red Crescent Movement (the Movement) and non-Movement partners, such as UN agencies, to deliver assistance to broader geographic areas. The National Society remains flexible and adaptive to the dynamic operational context to reach the most vulnerable and affected populations whilst ensuring compliance with security protocols for mobilizing personnel., EMERGENCY APPEAL REVISION, This revision of the IFRC Emergency Appeal addresses the rapidly evolving operational context and the resulting increase in humanitarian needs across Myanmar. Accordingly, it also extends the timeframe of the appeal by one year. This revised Emergency Appeal endeavours to maintain operational relevance and responsiveness for the provision of humanitarian assistance, including preparedness, to the affected populations. Note that the title of this revised emergency appeal has subsequently been changed from ‘civil unrest’ to ‘complex emergency’, reflecting the evolving humanitarian situation. Information describing the accomplishments achieved under the Emergency Appeal, up until 30 November 2021, is accessible in Operations Update No. 2., TARGETING, Through the revised Emergency Appeal, at least 202,000 people deemed the most vulnerable, will be provided with essential humanitarian support provided by the MRCS in 14 states and regions. This support will encompass emergency first aid and ambulance services, expanded basic health care services, livelihood support, and in-kind assistance to address basic needs. The geographic focus was initially on states and regions where civil unrest, clashes and protests took place, with humanitarian support primarily consisting of emergency first aid and ambulance services. The interventions are now further prioritized for Kayah, Kayin, Shan, and Chin states and the regions of Magway and Sagaing. These areas have been most affected by the crisis and are currently where the needs remain unmet. Given the dynamic nature of this emergency, the MRCS has pre-empted the likelihood of needing to broaden the geographic scope of the response to other states and will therefore remain prepared for and responsive to meeting emerging humanitarian needs in close coordination with Movement partners active in these areas, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)., Targeting will prioritize groups in the most vulnerable locations and includes the following categories:, Peri-urban areas with socio-economic challenges with relief needs focused on major cities., Regions/states with existing vulnerabilities with populations at risk of increased displacement., Hard-to-reach areas where the MRCS has managed to secure access to deliver humanitarian assistance., At the district/local level, further prioritization will be given to the following groups:, People directly affected physically, psychologically, or socio-economically by violence in hot spots., People affected by the emerging violence and who are newly displaced., Vulnerable and affected people in periurban areas with socio-economic challenges., People in regions/states with existing vulnerabilities and at risk of increased displacement., Displaced people deciding to return to their homes, safely and voluntarily., Within this geographic focus, household targeting will include additional vulnerability criteria. The vulnerability criteria will focus on women/child-headed households, pregnant or lactating women, persons with disabilities, the elderly, those suffering from chronic illnesses and families with children under five years old.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-asia-pacific-complex-emergency-revised-emergency-appeal-n-mdrmm016

This mission was undertaken against the backdrop of escalating violence throughout Myanmar, as bombings and other excesses committed are compounding multiple vulnerabilities facing millions of people struggling for survival., The Special Envoy held frank and constructive discussion with the ASEAN Chair His Excellency Mr. Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia and the ASEAN Special Envoy His Excellency Mr. Prak Sokhonn, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, with a view to fostering meaningful and effective implementation of the ASEAN Five-Point Consensus., This important collaboration has been part of the Special Envoy’s close engagement with all ASEAN Foreign Ministers who, in their February statement, encouraged the ASEAN Special Envoy to coordinate closely with the Special Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General on Myanmar to ensure synergy., In her interactions with Member States, including during recent visits to the United Nations Headquarters in New York and Washington D.C., in the Security Council and through various Regional Organizations, the Special Envoy has continued to stress the urgency for coherent international backing of a unified regional approach supportive of a Myanmar-led process reflective of the will of the people., Recalling the importance highlighted by the Security Council and General Assembly for the Special Envoy to maintain communication and engage intensively with all relevant parties in Myanmar, the Special Envoy shared her comprehensive assessment of the somber ground realities and sentiments among a range of domestic stakeholders as she sought to strengthen complementarity to the work of ASEAN., In this respect, the Special Envoy’s extensive discussions with the Cambodian Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister focused on helping align the implementation of the Five-Point Consensus with the will and needs of the people, without further delay. She stressed it was paramount for ASEAN to listen carefully to all voices on the ground in supporting durable peace and national reconciliation. The Special Envoy emphasized that indicators and results on the ground were urgently needed, adding any goodwill towards protecting the people of Myanmar and their livelihoods needed to be demonstrated in concrete terms., The Special Envoy highlighted she will continue to amplify the voices of the people of Myanmar and encourage international action based on an accurate assessment of the situation. She will also continue to engage with all key stakeholders, focusing on helping articulate the bottom-lines and conditions needed for momentum towards any talks about talks in the greater interest of peace, stability and democracy., Such engagement will include the UN-ASEAN Women, Peace and Security (WPS) platform which will be co-chaired with Her Excellency Ms. Retno Marsudi, Foreign Minister of Indonesia. This platform would advance the humanitarian and protection agenda at the local level, especially for women and children who are disproportionately impacted by the violence, and to amplify the voices and vision of women and young people as agents of change., The Special Envoy urged the Prime Minister to leverage his influence on Myanmar’s Commander-in-Chief to de-escalate violence and serve the greater interests of the people. In the context of her own potential visit to Myanmar, the Special Envoy and the Prime Minster discussed the importance of convincing the military leadership that any stability requires the immediate cessation of hostilities and a genuinely inclusive approach. A federal democratic union must be pursued in accordance with the will of the people, grounded firmly in the ASEAN Charter and the norms and values of the United Nations., In her discussion with the ASEAN Special Envoy, Special Envoy Heyzer appreciated his sustained efforts in Myanmar to address obstacles in delivering humanitarian assistance, and his follow up proposals including a Consultative Meeting, and further discussions on visit outcomes such as the ASEAN Troika mechanism, the Friends of Myanmar, and the Humanitarian Corridor Arrangement. She highlighted the importance of effective humanitarian assistance to all people in need without discrimination. This will require safe and unhindered access to all affected areas and the delivery of aid through all existing channels., In this regard, the Special Envoy reinforced the importance of an expanded approach to providing humanitarian assistance, adding that a robust ASEAN-UN umbrella, which both Envoys could co-facilitate to deliver assistance to affected communities through all existing channels and address the multiple priority needs of the people across the country. This would include civilian protection as well as food security, socio-economic resilience, humanitarian and COVID-19 assistance., The Special Envoy’s discussions in Phnom Penh also stressed that addressing the plight of the Rohingya needed to be part and parcel of any broader solution for a genuinely inclusive Myanmar. She urged ASEAN to redouble its efforts to help support durable solutions for Rohingya remaining in Rakhine as a key confidence builder., There is an urgency to help the people of Myanmar realize, in concrete terms, their desire for a peaceful, democratic and inclusive future. ASEAN and the broader international community have a responsibility to amplify and support the will of the people. It is also the obligation of any responsible military to protect its citizens and respect their aspirations. She reiterated her commitment to working closely with ASEAN and its members towards this end, making available the wide array of comparative advantages and expertise of the United Nations to reinforce and complement regional action.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/note-correspondents-readout-special-envoy-secretary-general-myanmar-ms-noeleen

That morning, a villager named Naw (https://khrg.org/2022/03/22-56-d1/dooplaya-district-short-update-woman-was-killed-mortar-shrapnel-during#ftn7) Pu Tin, aged about 41 years old and living in E--- village, was hit by shrapnel from an exploded mortar during a period of indiscriminate shelling [it is unknown which armed group fired the mortar]. [The shrapnel of the mortar hit her underarm causing a large and deep wound around major arteries.] She died immediately., That day, the shelling began after she and her husband, who had previously been displaced on February 3rd 2022, returned to their village [without their children], in order to feed their livestock. Her husband had tied up the cows near their house and had gone to the front of the house. She had fed the pigs and then went to the kitchen. A mortar then fell near her house and the exploded mortar shrapnel hit her, resulting in her death. Her husband was not injured. That same day, other displaced villagers from the same village also returned to their village when the situation seemed calmer, in order to feed their livestock and to get food., All villagers from E---village, as well as O--- village, H--- village and T---village in Kaw T’Ree Township had to flee [as a result of the fighting]. Only a few older people stayed in the village during the fighting between the two armed groups.

They fear that the SAC troops will fire mortars [at the village] if they [SAC soldiers] see there is a light turned on in the huts. Villagers usually clear their fields [prepare their fields for the next harvest by clearing long grass and bushes and then burning the fields] during the summer, but they fear that they will be fired at by SAC troops while they are working., The villagers feel they are not at risk of stepping on landmines in their fields because they are avoiding prohibited areas that are contaminated by landmines [which the KNLA have told the villagers about]; the villagers are only afraid of SAC shelling., The villagers say that international organisations and local KNU leaders have not done anything yet to resolve the matter of SAC troops shelling and killing many civilians. The villagers believe that if they [international organisations and KNU leaders] had taken action [to avoid fighting in civilian areas], more villagers would not have been killed by SAC shelling.

In early March, skirmishes broke out between the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) and State Administration Council (SAC). In response, the SAC fired mortars at civilian areas. Due to the shelling, local villagers fled in fear from their villages. In addition, the SAC burned down a COVID-19 screening checkpoint and villagers’ belongings, including a shop.

SAC LIB #604 is based at Day Dah Hkoh army camp, which is very close to A--- village [SAC LIB #604 is also based at D--- village, K’Lay Hkoh village tract (https://khrg.org/2022/03/22-76-d1/taw-oo-district-short-update-killing-shelling-displacement-and-destruction-covid-19#ftn5), Daw Hpa Hkoh Township]. SAC LIB #604 is led by Battalion Commander Hain San Tun (who is based at the Day Dah Hkoh army camp). After the fighting, SAC LIB #604 from Day Dah Hkoh army camp fired mortars at nearby villages. Local villagers were very afraid that they would be hit by the mortars. No villagers were injured, but their plantations (cardamom, turmeric and coffee) were damaged by the shelling., On the morning of March 8th 2022, soldiers from SAC Support Unit #930 from Southern Command Headquarters went back to Toungoo Town after they transported food and ammunition to their Ta Bwe Klo and Thauk Yay Khat army camps in Daw Hpa Hkoh Township. While they were returning, they encountered local KNLA soldiers, and an armed clash occurred around 7:45 am. During the fighting, more than five SAC soldiers were killed and one SAC truck was destroyed. The fighting took place between B--- village and C--- village, Kweh P’Loh village tract, Daw Hpa Hkoh Township. After the fighting, SAC LIB #604, based in D--- village, K’Lay Hkoh village tract, Daw Hpa Hkoh Township, about 10 miles [16.09 km] from where the fighting took place, indiscriminately fired about 15 mortars from their army camp at nearby villages, including D---, C---, A--- and E--- villages. The shelling damaged villagers’ plantations. The blasts also shook villagers’ houses, leading villagers to flee their villages out of fear., According to local villagers, on March 8th 2022 at around 12:00 pm in B--- village, a soldier from SAC LIB #604 went to the house of villager Saw Aung Aung and shot him five times [villagers found five bullet wounds on his body], killing him. He was about 30 years old and a father to one son. The order to shoot and kill Saw Aung Aung came from Battalion Commander Hain San Tun. After Saw Aung Aung was shot dead, they [SAC soldiers] took his phone and the money found on his body. Then, they dragged his dead body along the road from Htah Thaw Hpoh Lee village to the place of that day’s earlier armed clash [most likely to make it appear as though he was killed in the fighting]. On March 13th 2022, local villagers found the dead body of Saw Aung Aung there. His body was already rotting and sticky [decomposing]., On March 9th 2022 at 6:30 pm, about 20 soldiers from SAC LIB #604, led by Battalion Commander Hain San Tun, entered D--- village, K’Lay Hkoh village tract, Daw Hpa Hkoh Township. They then fired more than 100 rounds from small arms and six artillery shells into plantations between D--- village and F--- village, Htee Thar Saw village tract, Daw Hpa Hkoh Township. Villagers from both villages and the plantations fled as they were very afraid. After firing those shots, Battalion Commander Hain San Tun and 11 of his soldiers went to meet the Section #3 SAC administrator in D--- village at 7:30 pm but the administrator was not at his house. However, the administrator’s wife was at the house at that time. Therefore, they [the SAC commander and his soldiers] talked to the administrator’s wife and asked her about Karen National Union (KNU)[6] members and family of KNU members in the village. She said she did not know any members of the KNU. Then they pointed a gun at her and asked her to show them the houses of KNU members. [Out of fear] she showed them [the SAC soldiers] a house [without knowing anything]. Later, they [the SAC] burned and destroyed food, clothing, house materials, pots, bowls and about 300 viss [480 kg][7] of dried turmeric from that house. (Villagers sell dried turmeric for income in order to support their livelihoods.) They also confiscated a smartphone from the house., At 8:30 pm on March 9th 2022, they [SAC LIB #604] fired warning shots using artillery fire to encourage villagers to leave their villages. They [SAC LIB #604 soldiers] told villagers that they should leave with their belongings to other places by 10:00 am on March 10th 2022 because they will fire mortars into Section #3 of D---- village and clear the area after 10:00 am on that day. In the early morning of March 10th 2022, some villagers fled to other safe places by car and motorbike; while others fled by foot. They did not even cook or eat breakfast [that morning before fleeing]., On March 11th 2022 at 11:00 am, SAC LIB #604 burned down a shop owned by a villager who lives in B--- village, Kweh P’Loh village tract, Daw Hpa Hkoh Township.

This village is located near where fighting broke out between the KNLA and SAC a few days earlier [on March 8th 2022]. Also, they [SAC soldiers] restricted the villagers’ movement by not allowing any villager to leave the village [some villagers already fled when the fighting happened]. Later, they [the SAC] allowed villagers to leave, but almost everyone in the village had already [covertly] fled due to ongoing indiscriminate shelling near the village. In addition, on March 9th 2021, they [LIB #604] also burned down a COVID-19 screening checkpoint near D--- village, K’Lay Hkoh village tract, Daw Hpa Hkoh Township., Further background reading on the security situation and human rights violations in Taw Oo District in Southeast Burma can be found in the following KHRG reports:, “Taw Oo District Incident Report: A villager’s house was damaged by indiscriminate gunfire from a drunk SAC military officer in Daw Hpa Hkoh Township, August 2021”, December 2021., “Taw Oo District Incident Report: Killing case in Daw Hpa Hkoh Township, July 2021”, December 2021., “Taw Oo District Incident Report: Rape case in Daw Hpa Hkoh Township, August 2020”, February 2021.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/taw-oo-district-short-update-killing-shelling-displacement-and-destruction-covid-19

Impact of Education Disruption: East Asia and Pacific - March 2022,Infographic,UNICEF,Education,30 Mar 2022,"On average, schools in the East Asia and Pacific region have been fully closed for 18 weeks, as of 28 February 2022, according to the UNESCO Global Monitoring of School Closures. By the end of February 2022, nearly a third of countries in the region saw durations of full school closures beyond the global average of 20 weeks., The total duration of school closures (fully closed and partially closed) ranges from 0 weeks in Nauru to 87 weeks in Indonesia. Schoolchildren in the region have lost near 400 billion hours of in-person learning., Pre-COVID, and among countries with available data, the proportion of children who can read a simple text ranged from 2 per cent in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic to 82 per cent in China. A growing body of evidence shows substantial losses and worsening inequalities in learning outcomes as a result of COVID related school closures. Under a pessimistic scenario, students in the region could lose an estimated 0.9 learning-adjusted years of schooling. In Indonesia, students are predicted to lose up to 11 points on the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) reading scale and 249 dollars in future individual earnings due to the four-month closure period from 24 March 2020 to the end of July 2020. In Cambodia, an analysis of the Grade 6 national learning assessment results supported by UNICEF revealed the proportion of low achievers who failed to meet the basic proficiency level increased from 34 per cent to 45 per cent in Khmer language and from 49 per cent to 74 per cent in math between 2016 and 2021.

"Southeast Burma Field Report: Armed conflict, airstrikes, displacement, and increased human rights violations, including forced labour, the use of human shields and torture, July to December 2021",Situation Report,KHRG,"Food and Nutrition
Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",30 Mar 2022,"Introduction, This Field Report presents and analyses information collected by KHRG field researchers and covers the period between July and December 2021., The reporting period was marked by increased armed conflict and attacks, which spread to locations in KHRG’s operational area that had reported little to no fighting or shelling during the initial five months following the February 1st 2021 military coup. It was also marked by an increase in human rights violations, including forced labour, the use of human shields, torture, killings, theft and looting, and the planting of landmines., Burma (Myanmar) is party to several human rights treaties and is bound by principles of customary international human rights law prohibiting arbitrary deprivation of life; torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; and arbitrary deprivation of liberty. During the current reporting period, KHRG documented multiple cases of forced labour and the use of civilians as human shields. In most cases, villagers were forced to serve as both porters and human shields as State Administration Council (SAC) and Border Guard Force (BGF) troops engaged in troop rotation and the transport of rations and ammunition between army camps in areas controlled by the Karen National Union (KNU). Both forced labour and the use of human shields constitute violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) and other human rights conventions. In many cases, these acts have been combined with other rights violations like beatings or torture, the deprivation of food and water, and various threats, including threat to life. In Bilin Township, Doo Tha Htoo (Thaton) District, villagers living between Lay Kay and Yoh Klah army camps were subjected to repeated demands for forced labour and ‘navigation’ over the course of several months. In particular, skirmishes and ambush by the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), due to SAC and BGF trespass while travelling between their camps, systematically led SAC and BGF troops to round up any villagers they found along the way to protect themselves from further attack. At times, skirmishes and ambushes took place while villagers were forced to porter or navigate, putting them in grave danger. Villagers also experienced looting and other security threats as SAC and BGF soldiers camped in or near their villages while traveling between their army camps., A surge of armed conflict and attacks, including airstrikes, took place in the Lay Kay Kaw area of Dooplaya District in December 2021 after SAC and BGF troops entered the area and conducted raids and arrests while searching for Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) participants and People’s Defence Force (PDF) members. Established at the time of the earlier ceasefire agreements to welcome back former refugees and IDPs to their country, Lay Kay Kaw New Town was supposed to serve as the symbol of a new era of peace and unity. Instead, the former refugees and IDPs who live there found themselves fleeing once again for their lives as fighting erupted throughout the area. Over 10,000 people were displaced in just over a week. Possibilities for seeking refuge in Thailand remain extremely limited. Most displaced villagers were either pushed back by Thai authorities or forced to set up temporary encampments along the river., Mu Traw (Hpapun) District had been the target of major offensives, including airstrikes, during the first five months of the coup. Although there were no further airstrikes in Mu Traw District from July to December 2021, most parts of the district continued to experience heavy conflict and military activities. In some areas, fighting and shelling took place on a near daily basis during the current reporting period, thus many villagers continue to face displacement. Those who have remained in their villages have endured repeated threats by SAC soldiers, including battalion commanders, who seek to punish civilians for the activities of the KNLA. Such acts are in clear violation of international humanitarian law, which forbids reprisals against civilian persons and objects., Fighting continued in Kler Lwee Htoo (Nyaunglebin) District, leading to some displacement. While no fighting or shelling was reported for Taw Oo (Toungoo), Mergui-Tavoy and Hpa-an districts prior to July 2021, during the current reporting period, KHRG documented the emergence of fighting in both Taw Oo and Mergui-Tavoy districts. In the case of Mergui-Tavoy District, the fighting occurred between the SAC and a local group of PDF fighters., Military activity, like troop rotation and reinforcement, sending rations and ammunition, and patrolling, continued to increase throughout all districts, except Hpa-an District (for which KHRG received no reports). These activities often included or took place alongside other activities, such as the increased use of checkpoints, direct threats against local villagers, arbitrary arrests, and opening fire while in villages, that led to heightened insecurity for local villagers., Theft and looting, particularly of food items, crops and livestock, became more systematic as the presence of SAC soldiers in rural areas, including KNU territory, spread. Most of the theft and looting during the current reporting period occurred while SAC and BGF troops passed through villages or were temporarily camped in the area. Theft and looting have often taken place after villagers have been forced to flee their homes, and in some cases have been combined with the destruction of property. Looting and the destruction of property are prohibited under various components of international humanitarian law, including Additional Protocol II (Article 14) concerning the protection of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, like foodstuffs, crops and livestock., Other serious human rights violations like torture and killings took place during the current reporting period. As the SAC continued to target anyone seen as opposing the military regime, it undertook violence against civilians while searching for people whom they suspected of having an affiliation with the PDF and CDM. On multiple occasions, SAC soldiers tortured and beat local civilians following bomb explosions in the area. SAC soldiers intentionally shot at civilians, killing three. In one of the killing cases, local villagers believe the victim was also tortured by the SAC prior to being killed., Landmine contamination and the planting of new landmines continued to be a serious problem, with landmines being placed in civilian areas, along transportation routes and near critical infrastructure, as well as in areas that villagers depend on for their livelihood. Two deaths and injury to eight villagers, including one child, were reported for the current reporting period. All reported incidents took place in Mu Traw District. Villagers were often not made aware of the landmine contamination in their area. KHRG also received reports of time bomb explosions., In July 2021, Burma was hit with a third wave of COVID-19 infections, this time reaching rural areas in KHRG’s operational area. Often whole villages reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, but due to lack of testing facilities, there was no way to confirm that all of these were positive COVID-19 cases. However, in Mergui-Tavoy District, where the Karen Department of Health and Welfare (KDHW) actively engaged in testing, positive cases were found in every township of the district. The spread of the virus has been particularly worrisome in situations of displacement with reports of the virus spreading among groups who have displaced, since many are unaware that they are infected. Displaced villagers may also find themselves crowded together in hiding places, making the likelihood of infection greater. Access to healthcare services in general continued to be an issue due to restrictions on movement, brought about both by efforts to contain the spread of the virus and by increased military activities and armed conflict., Access to education also continued to be an issue due to widespread school closures tied to the spread of COVID-19, the CDM and refusals by students to attend SAC-run schools since the military takeover. Most Karen Education and Culture Department (KECD) schools remained open and experienced increased enrolments as students who previously attended government schools sought to continue their studies in KECD schools. The additional enrolments have placed heavy strain on KECD schools, and some have begun requiring parents to pay educational fees or rice (for the teachers) to keep the schools running., The livelihood situation of villagers has grown more critical. Villagers reported being unable to work on their farms or plantations or travel to access work as day labourers. A number of factors have prevented villagers from carrying out their regular livelihood activities: displacement, conflict, ongoing military activity, landmine contamination, travel restrictions tied to COVID-19, increased checkpoints and security concerns while traveling, and fears of being apprehended to serve as forced porters or human shields. Many villagers are also now facing severe food insecurity as a result.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/southeast-burma-field-report-armed-conflict-airstrikes-displacement-and-increased
Joint news release: WFP and UNOPS Livelihoods and Food Security Fund team up to provide cash transfers for vulnerable communities affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Myanmar,News and Press Release,UNOPS,Food and Nutrition,25 Mar 2022,"Yangon - The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the UNOPS-managed Livelihoods and Food Security Fund (LIFT) have just launched a cash assistance programme for most vulnerable communities in conflict-affected areas as they continue coping with the impact of COVID-19 in Myanmar., Through technical support from WFP, LIFT has recently provided one-time, 65,000 Myanmar Kyat (appr 36 USD) cash transfers to over 46,000 households, including internally displaced people and poor families in conflict-affected communities in Kachin, northern Shan, Rakhine and Chin states.

"BROUK Welcomes New Sanctions On Myanmar Military By US, UK And Canada",News and Press Release,BROUK,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,25 Mar 2022,"Media release from Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK, The Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK) today welcomed a fresh round of sanctions against Myanmar military leaders, military-affiliated cronies and businesses, as well as a military unit, by the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. The announcement came ahead of Myanmar’s Armed Forces Day, on March 27., The United States announced sanctions against five individuals and five entities connected to the military regime, including the 66th Light Infantry Division, one of the junta’s notorious shock troops, while the United Kingdom sanctioned two individuals and three companies “responsible for supplying the Myanmar military regime with weapons and equipment”, and also designated the military’s new Head of Air Force. Canada sanctioned four individuals and two business entities., “Cutting sources of revenue and arms to the military is essential, so these new sanctions are very welcome,” said Tun Khin, President of BROUK. “The USA, UK and Canada have the right strategy in sanctioning the military and its allies but the sanctions are coming too slowly. They need to increase the pace of sanctions and expand the scope to include gas revenue and aviation fuel.”, The sanctions announcements come days after the United States designated the military’s campaign of violence against the Rohingya a genocide, an announcement made at the US Holocaust Museum in Washington DC., “Targeted economic sanctions are just one tool, and we need to see other tools used such as support for international justice mechanisms like referring Burma to the International Criminal Court, and joining or financing the genocide case at the International Court of Justice,” said Tun Khin. “The United States’ genocide declaration this week was welcome recognition for the suffering us Rohingya have endured, but it must amount to more than words, and be turned into concrete actions that ultimately remove this junta from power.”, Those who had their assets frozen by the US, UK and Canada include Aung Moe Myint, director of Dynasty International Company, Aung Hlaing Oo, managing director of Myanmar Chemical Machinery Co Ltd, as well as General Htun Aung, the newly-appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Air Force., “The military have not been able to establish control since the attempted coup and are vulnerable to pressure if it can be applied fast enough. We need to cut arms, cut revenue, deny legitimacy, ensure accountability and increase humanitarian and political support to the people of Burma,” said Tun Khin. “The USA, UK and Canada are moving in the right direction but crawling instead of racing.”, For more Information contact Tun Khin on +44 7888714866",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/brouk-welcomes-new-sanctions-myanmar-military-us-uk-and-canada
Solidarités International Myanmar: Update on Water Scarcity (24 of March 2022),Situation Report,SI,"Health
Water Sanitation Hygiene",24 Mar 2022,"Keywords: water insecurity, climate change, preparedness, public health, IDPs, Introduction:, The Rohingya IDPs in the Pauktaw Township in Rakhine State (Myanmar) suffer annual potable water scarcity during the dry season into early rainy season. Due to hydrogeology, with surface brackish water and sea water intrusion, the area’s main water source is rainwater collected in ponds. Due to water loss, linked to seepage and evaporation, the ponds go dry 3-months a year, impeding meeting the minimum humanitarian standards during water scarcity period, and water is boated in to fill the gaps., This is a costly intervention, easily disrupted and not financially sustainable. Moreover, water supplied is limited, impacting personal hygiene, including menstrual hygiene, and public health, creating the conditions for diffusion of skin infections, COVID-19, acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) etc. Climate change is starting to exacerbate these issues, as sea level rise threatens to flood low lying camps, increases saltwater intrusion and makes rainy season unpredictable., Update:, Considering the upcoming season of water scarcity in Pauktaw and the need for coordinated efforts to ensure continuation of water supply, as a life-saving action, it is shared below with relevant stakeholders the summary of the trend of water consumption and forecasted date of the start of the emergency response, based on our software to monitor and analyse each pond’s available water, together with the user numbers, and actual water consumption and losses, to predict scarcity timing and plan water boating for Rohingya settlements of Pauktaw township where Solidarités International is the main WASH service provider., Together with water boating, the response provided by Solidarités International includes a gradual reduction of water consumption to 7.5 litres/person/day, and a decrease of water points to ration distribution to delay the start of water boating. In addition, water conservation behavioural change messaging is provided to IDPs. To save freshwater, brackish water is used in public handwashing stations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/solidarit-s-international-myanmar-update-water-scarcity-24-march-2022

Water Sanitation Hygiene",25 Mar 2022,"In a recent return to Mindat to help people displaced by fighting in Chin State, we saw communities helping each other – carrying food, providing shelter, sharing meals. But relying on others is not always easy., As part of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) support team in early March, Ma Thiri Aung remembers meeting a young mother whose family farmed for a living before the clashes changed everything., ""The violence meant they were now displaced, with no jobs, no way to get food, relying only on assistance from others,"" Ma Thiri Aung says., ""This mother wanted to go back home, where her family could support themselves."" Ongoing armed conflict means people in Chin State continue to face the ordeal of having to leave their homes in search of safety., Thousands of people have been displaced as a result of fighting in recent months. Mindat is too high up in the mountains to cultivate rice, relying on food transports from other parts of Myanmar. But ongoing clashes make travel less safe – roads are mined or bridges damaged – threatening food supplies., ""When communities hear the Red Cross are coming, their main hope is rice,"" says Aye Thantar Tun, who led the ICRC team., Over nine days in early March, we worked alongside the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) to distribute much-needed food and other essential items to nearly 2000 people – including rice, oil and salt needed for cooking., In the monasteries and churches of Mindat where people are seeking shelter, we supplied families with basic rations, hygiene supplies, materials for shelter construction and information to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks., As clashes continue across Chin State, we also talked with communities about the risks posed by landmines and other explosive hazards., We worked with the community to make sure awareness of these threats would be accessible to all – putting up billboards and sharing educational cartoons for children.
From Mindat, the sound of clashes can sometimes be heard in this former tourist town. Being surrounded by violence, and displaced, can leave invisible scars. Going forward, supporting mental health care is also crucial., ""Even as people spoke, I could hear their worries in every sentence,"" says Aye Thantar Tun. ""They have been traumatized by what's going on."", While responding to existing needs, we also need to plan for futures ones. Surrounded by mountains, Mindat is very cold in winter and very hot in summer. In the rainy season, it is also prone to landslides., This exposure to the elements, endangers safe and sustainable access to water – via water pipelines already damaged by fighting – as well as to supplies of food and medicine as roads risk becoming blocked., Operating alongside our ICRC teams, a mobile health clinic, run by the MRCS, has proved a crucial way of ensuring people have access to medicine despite these overlapping challenges of access., The humanitarian needs of people impacted by fighting in Chin State continue to grow. Together with the MRCS, so will our support. We hope to return to Mindat again soon – to continue helping those in greatest need.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-returning-mindat
Myanmar: Armed Forces Day Spotlights Atrocities,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,25 Mar 2022,"Stronger Economic Measures, Arms Embargo Needed Against Military, (Bangkok) – Myanmar’s Armed Forces Day on March 27, 2022, is an opportunity for foreign governments to take stronger action against the military’s widespread abuses, Human Rights Watch said today., Concerned governments should strengthen economic sanctions against junta members and other senior military officers, as well as military-owned conglomerates. The United Nations Security Council should urgently adopt a global arms embargo against Myanmar and refer the country situation to the International Criminal Court., “Governments joining Myanmar’s Armed Forces Day celebrations are celebrating the military’s brutal suppression of its own people,” said Manny Maung, Myanmar researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Governments should instead participate by enacting targeted sanctions against the generals and military businesses.”, On March 26, 2021, the state MRTV news channel announced that anti-coup demonstrators “should learn from the tragedy of earlier ugly deaths that you can be in danger of getting shot to the head and back” and warned that “parents should also talk their children out of it [joining protests], let’s not waste lives for nothing.” This language was widely interpreted to signal that the security forces were planning to respond with force to planned protests on March 27., The next day, Myanmar security forces killed as many as 163 anti-coup protesters in deadly crackdowns. It was most likely the deadliest single day since country-wide protests broke out against the February 1, 2021 military coup., Since the coup, security forces have killed over 1,600 people and detained more than 12,000. Over 500,000 people have been internally displaced and the junta is deliberately blocking aid to populations in need as a form of collective punishment. Human Rights Watch has documented the military’s numerous abuses against the population that amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes., A joint report by Fortify Rights and the Schell Center for International Human Rights at Yale Law School, released on March 24, 2022, identifies 61 senior military and police officials who ordered abuses or are otherwise directly implicated in crimes committed against the population in the first six months after the coup., In recent weeks, there have been increasing reports of Myanmar military airstrikes and use of heavy weapons causing civilian loss of life and property. The UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, in his February report on government sales of weapons to the Myanmar military, said that jet aircraft, attack helicopters, armored vehicles, light and heavy artillery, missiles, and rockets were being used against civilians. More than 400 of the attacks reported occurred in Sagaing Region in northwestern Myanmar, where most civilian fatalities have recently occurred. The report identified Belarus, China, India, Israel, Pakistan, Russia, Serbia, South Korea, and Ukraine as having transferred arms to Myanmar since 2018 that could be used to attack civilians., Other countries such as Japan have not ended military ties and continue to provide training to the Myanmar military despite its long record of human rights abuses. Since 2015, Myanmar military cadets and officers have received academic and military training at Japan’s National Defense Academy and Japan Self-Defense Forces facilities. The Japanese government should immediately suspend the program and cut other military ties, or risk being complicit in the military’s atrocities., The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned Myanmar security forces’ violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in a March 15 report, and said the military was deliberately targeting civilians, many of whom were shot in the head, burned to death, arbitrarily arrested, tortured, or used as human shields., On March 21, the US government formally determined that the Myanmar military committed the crime of genocide and crimes against humanity against ethnic Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State. The US and like-minded governments should seek justice for grave international crimes against the Rohingya and other ethnic groups, as well as against the anti-coup protesters, and impose stronger economic measures against the military leadership, Human Rights Watch said., The UN Security Council – largely because of concerns of a Chinese or Russian veto – has not taken substantive action in response to the Myanmar military’s atrocities. Nevertheless, the council should impose an arms embargo on Myanmar and refer the situation in Rakhine State to the International Criminal Court., “The UN Security Council should act to help end the suffering of Myanmar’s people,” Maung said. “UN member countries should not keep waiting for the Security Council, however, and should take all possible action at the UN General Assembly and unilaterally to promote justice for Myanmar.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-armed-forces-day-spotlights-atrocities
The logistical challenge of responding to disaster,News and Press Release,The Lowy Institute,"Climate Change and Environment
Health
Logistics and Telecommunications
Protection and Human Rights",25 Mar 2022,"LINA GONG, Climate change will not only make for more frequent emergencies – it will change how and from where to provide relief., The humanitarian community has been challenged by major shocks in the past two years – the Covid-19 pandemic, a military coup in Myanmar, an invasion of Ukraine only the most prominent. These events, together with climate change as a threat multiplier, are changing the operating environment for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations of military forces., Logistics have proved a major issue. The pandemic hit emergency response particularly hard in terms of deployment of personnel and movement of relief items, from the mass transport of personal protective equipment to careful management of vaccine distribution. In Myanmar, humanitarian workers had to cope with restrictions caused by both Covid-19 and in the aftermath of the February 2021 military coup. And fighting in Ukraine in recent weeks following Russia’s invasion is a powerful reminder that a humanitarian crisis could break out in unexpected places., In the long run, the climate crisis threatens the safety and accessibility of infrastructure and facilities for emergency response, with effects projected to become more intense. In Southeast Asia, for instance, the latest IPCC report predicts that the region will have significant increases in extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and strong monsoons. Moreover, countries and communities which used not to be disaster-prone are now increasingly vulnerable. Several states of Malaysia were hit by deadly floods in December, including some in the central and west coast of the peninsula which are not typically affected., Existing logistical planning will need to be adjusted. Shifting patterns of disasters will also change the availability and accessibility of infrastructure and equipment for operations. The Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, for instance, is the world’s most vulnerable to sea level rise. Indonesia is planning to relocate its capital as Jakarta is threatened by climate risks., The response to the tsunami following the volcanic eruption in Tonga in January was a further example of the difficultly involved with deploying personnel in the field during a pandemic. The Tongan government was reluctant to accept deployment of foreign humanitarian workers due to the concern about Covid-19., Political and security tensions adds to volatility when the military seeks to fulfill humanitarian responsibilities. Not wanting to be be seen to take sides was a concern for Australia and Pacific neighbours when responding to a request last November for assistance following riots in Solomon Islands. Likewise, after the coup in Myanmar, many governments have avoided official engagement with Myanmar so as not to render legitimacy to the military government. As a result, alternative channels for humanitarian assistance have been explored outside the official channel. During the Covid-19 Delta wave in mid-2021, Singapore sent oxygen concentrators to Myanmar through the Singapore Red Cross. In contrast, Singapore’s assistance to Indonesia in the same period was delivered by the Changi Regional Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Coordination Centre., The sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine have further strained global shipping industry and supply chains, which have struggled during the pandemic. Even in the face of a growing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, no one would seriously countenance the deployment of foreign military forces to provide relief aid at this stage., The experience in response to these recent challenges shows a need to adapt humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operation logistics. Remote support such as contactless humanitarian aid has been adopted to prevent the spread of Covid-19. But more adaptation will be required. The resilience of warehouses for relief supplies should be enhanced to reduce disruption by climate-extremes in the future, particularly with heatwaves and floods expected to become more common and intense., Training should be designed to increase awareness about the evolving risks in disaster relief and prepare military personnel for harsher and more complex operating environments. Private logistic companies can also be partners for military forces with limited overseas facilities. Prior agreements on sharing assets, facilities, human resources and networks between militaries as well as between military and non-military actors can alleviate the constraints in times of disasters., But some rules from previous experience will endure. As always, information sharing is crucial for effective remote logistical support, as accurate information about the needs as well as the national and international response forms the basis of decisions to ensure help is delivered where most needed.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/logistical-challenge-responding-disaster

Several clashes and airstrikes occurred around Kawakareik Township, resulting in the forced displacement of about 4,100 people, mostly within the southern part of the township (3,210 individuals) but also towards Hpa-An Township (100 individuals) and Thandaunggyi Township (740 individuals). In addition, several IDPs in Thandaunggyi who have been displaced since mid-February were verified only this week, including 50 individuals who were displaced towards Mon State., In Shan State (South), clashes in Pekon Township resulted in the displacement of 2,460 people within the township., In Kayah State, the situation in Demoso Township continues to be tense with security risks prompting 3,220 IDPs to move to safer locations within the township and also towards Shan State’s Pekon and Hsihseng townships. Concurrently, returns were recorded in Shan State (South) with 3,300 IDPs in Pekon Township returning to villages of origin within the township, while 2,120 IDPs in Hsishseng Township returned to Loikaw Township in Kayah State. The high number of secondary and tertiary displacements in Kayah State suggests that the security situation remains volatile and returns may only be temporary.",https://reliefweb.int/map/myanmar/myanmar-emergency-overview-map-number-people-displaced-south-east-feb-2021-and-remain-21

The number of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) within Myanmar rose substantially in 2021. According to the UN, of the 690,000 IDPs in Myanmar as of 27 December 2021, an estimated 52 per cent were women and 34 per cent were children. Of these, 320,000 were displaced by armed conflict and unrest since 1 February 2021. The majority of the new displacement occurred in Myanmar's northwest and southeast, as well as in Kachin and Shan states. IDPs have been forced to live in terrible conditions – some in camps, some in host communities and others in the jungle, without adequate food, shelter, sanitation, and medical care. In 2021, local organizations and partners provided basic assistance to previously and newly displaced people and host communities, where possible. However, IDPs and host communities continued to face shortages of food and livelihoods support, clothes, relief items and COVID-19 preventative supplies, largely due to the fighting, as well as restrictions on access, movement and transport. The new IDPS are in addition to the hundreds of thousands of people already living in protracted displacement in Kachin, Kayin, Rakhine and Shan states prior to February 2021., The military takeover and the large-scale Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) that followed heavily impacted the economy and the already fragile public service sector in 2021, further restricting people’s access to essential basic social services such as education and health. The crisis caused severe interruptions to basic health services, risking long-term consequences for the health and well-being of Myanmar’s population. The health sector has been under enormous strain due to both the CDM and COVID-19. The CDM resulted in severe reductions in the available public health workforce with many health staff walking out of public facilities in protest, at a time when health services were needed most due to the pandemic. The impact of staffing interruptions was compounded by repeated attacks on healthcare and the occupation of health facilities by parties to the conflict, further reducing the options available to affected people and resulting in unmet needs. Significant portions of the community were also unwilling to seek care through public services where they were provided by the de facto authorities. While NGOs, Ethnic Health Organizations (EAOs) and private health services tried to cover the gap, they were not able to fully compensate for the breakdown of public services. Access to education was also heavily disrupted. Due to the combined effects of COVID-19 and the military takeover, nearly all of Myanmar’s 12 million school aged children missed out on almost two years of education in 2020 and 2021., These inter-related risks also exacerbated pre-existing needs among already vulnerable women, girls, men and boys, including stateless Rohingya people and people living in protracted displacement, predominantly in the country’s northeast and southwest. The crisis deepened the needs of these population groups because of reduced livelihoods opportunities, aggravated by the increase in prices of basic goods. At the same time, access constraints due to COVID and the current political crisis undermined the quality and predictability of humanitarian assistance delivered to extremely aid-dependent communities. This was especially true of assistance to stateless Rohingya people in Rakhine, who are among the country’s most vulnerable people. As with new conflict areas, access to people with pre-existing needs in rural locations was particularly affected, leaving considerable gaps and unmet needs., According to UNDP, the 2021 economic and political turmoil has driven almost half of the population (25 million people) into poverty in 2022, wiping out the impressive gains made since 2005. Increasing numbers of vulnerable women, girls, men and boys exhausted their coping capacity and slipped into humanitarian need for the first time. Price hikes, COVID-19 movement restrictions and ongoing insecurity forced the most marginalized and vulnerable people to resort to emergency coping strategies in order to buy food and other essential supplies, often negatively impacting their safety, well-being and dignity. The sale of productive assets was especially worrying as this is very difficult to reverse. In some states and regions, prices for crucial household commodities rose significantly, making some food items increasingly unaffordable. Farming incomes were affected by lower wholesale prices for some crops, higher input prices, lower farm gate prices and limited access to credit, affecting agricultural livelihoods and food supplies. COVID-19 related border closures reduced agricultural export earnings and made essential farming inputs less available and more expensive., Monsoon floods in July and August 2021 affected more than 120,000 people across various parts of the country, resulting in crop losses and further contributing to food insecurity., The compounding crises of 2021 profoundly and disproportionally impacted women and girls, as well as people with disability in Myanmar. The impacts of COVID-19 restrictions and the worsening security situation resulted in a continued heavy burden of care for women looking after sick family members and children who were unable to return to school. This impacted women's availability to engage in paid work and further strained households financially. Women-headed households and women previously employed in sectors such as the garment industry were particularly affected. Women health workers involved in the CDM and those previously employed at health facilities that were targeted, occupied or shut down also faced negative financial impacts. People with disabilities faced additional safety and security risks. They also regularly faced challenges in accessing basic services as they were unable to reach service points due to their impairment and stressed communities were unable to provide the same level of support",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-response-plan-monitoring-report-january-december-2021

"Atrocity Alert No. 293: Myanmar (Burma), Ukraine and South Sudan",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,24 Mar 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., U.S. DETERMINES MYANMAR’S MILITARY PERPETRATED GENOCIDE AGAINST ROHINGYA, On Monday, 21 March, the United States (US) formally determined that the violence perpetrated by Myanmar’s (Burma) military – the Tatmadaw – against the minority Rohingya population constituted genocide and crimes against humanity. In 2016 and 2017 the Tatmadaw engaged in so-called “clearance operations” against the minority Rohingya population that were characterized by indiscriminate killings, torture, arbitrary detention, sexual violence and forced displacement. More than 350 Rohingya villages were destroyed and 745,000 people were forced to flee. The genocide followed decades of institutionalized and systematic persecution of the Rohingya by the government, which continues today., During Monday’s announcement, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken asserted that, “the attack against Rohingya was widespread and systematic, which is crucial for reaching a determination of crimes against humanity. The evidence also points to a clear intent behind these mass atrocities – the intent to destroy Rohingya, in whole or in part.”, Many of the same military leaders who oversaw the genocidal campaign against the Rohingya, including Min Aung Hlaing, participated in the February 2021 military coup in Myanmar and continue to perpetrate atrocities against the population. According to a report released by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on 15 March, there are reasonable grounds to believe that since the February coup the military has engaged in violations and abuses that may amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes. OHCHR reported that, “the military has bombarded populated areas with airstrikes and heavy weapons, as well as deliberately targeted civilians, many of whom have been shot in the head, burned to death, arbitrarily arrested, tortured or used as human shields.”, Echoing OHCHR’s findings, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, deplored the lack of strong, coordinated action by the international community, emphasizing that, despite being “told that the world has a ‘responsibility to protect,’ victims of atrocity crimes… the people of Myanmar see only endless expressions of concern from the international community, vague declarations that something should be done and a tedious, endless wait for a consensus to act.”, The genocide determination made by the US must be accompanied by concrete action to achieve justice for the Rohingya, as well as deter the Tatmadaw from continuing to perpetrate atrocities. Other member states should publicly recognize that Myanmar committed genocide against the Rohingya and the international community should impose punitive measures against the military. The UN Security Council should refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court and UN member states must fully support all justice and accountability processes in relation to past and current atrocities in Myanmar. Neighboring states must take more substantial bilateral steps to respond to the ongoing crisis in Myanmar., CIVILIAN SUFFERING DEEPENS ONE MONTH INTO RUSSIA’S INVASION OF UKRAINE, Tomorrow, 24 March, marks one month since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The conflict has unleashed a devastating crisis for civilians in many Ukrainian cities as Russian forces increasingly target civilian infrastructure. The UN has reported that over 10 million people have been displaced by the war, while an estimated 12 million remain trapped and unable to leave due to fighting. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has verified at least 977 civilians killed, including at least 81 children, while acknowledging that the real death toll is much higher., Myriad abuses have been reported over the past month, including Russian troops targeting civilians and looting homes and markets, as well as unverified reports of forced deportations from Ukraine to Russia. The south eastern port city of Mariupol has been subject to an especially brutal bombardment, trapping at least 100,000 people without access to food, water, heat or electricity. Shelling has hit hospitals, schools and homes, as well as buses evacuating civilians out of the area. Russian forces have also bombed locations where populations are sheltering from the violence, including the Mariupol Drama Theater and an art school in the city that were housing hundreds of people. On 20 March Russia gave residents until 5 AM to surrender Mariupol, saying those who surrendered could leave while those who stayed would face tribunals at the hands of Russian-backed separatists. Local authorities declined, increasing fears of heavier attacks on civilians remaining in the city., Targeted attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, as well as the use of indiscriminate weapons against civilians, are prohibited under international law and may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity. If civilians have been forcibly transferred or deported to Russia, that could constitute a war crime., Negotiations aimed at ending the conflict have reportedly progressed, but have yet to achieve a cessation of hostilities. UN Secretary-General António Guterres urged parties to the conflict to hasten the pace of negotiations, stressing that, “this war is unwinnable. Sooner or later, it will have to move from the battlefield to the peace table. The only question is: How many more lives must be lost? How many more bombs must fall? How many more Mariupols must be destroyed? How many more Ukrainians and Russians will be killed before everyone realizes that this war has no winners – only losers?”, Amidst the deepening crisis, the international community must increase its pressure on Russian authorities to halt the invasion, in line with the International Court of Justice’s provisional measures imposed last week. States should also continue to exert pressure at the UN, including through suspending Russia from the Human Rights Council., UN REPORT HIGHLIGHTS WIDESPREAD CONFLICT-RELATED SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN SOUTH SUDAN, On 21 March the UN Human Rights Council (HRC)-mandated Commission of Human Rights in South Sudan (CHRSS) released a Conference Room Paper on conflict-related sexual violence against women and girls in South Sudan. Drawing on testimonies and interviews conducted between February 2020 and February 2022, the CHRSS concluded that conflict-related sexual violence against women and girls is widespread and systematic in South Sudan and “takes place in the context of persistent conflict and insecurity, drastic gender inequity, and prevailing impunity, which exacerbate its prevalence and contribute to its normalization.”, The report outlined that the various forms of sexual and gender-based violence, including rape, gang rape and mass rape, abductions and sexual slavery and sexual torture are not “random opportunistic incidents” but “involve high degree of planning and deliberate intention.” According to the CHRSS, these crimes stem in part from the failure of political elites to address security sector reform and to provide basic necessities to the armed forces. This contributes to a permissive environment for predatory and violent behavior against civilians., South Sudanese armed forces, non-state armed groups, militias linked to powerful individuals or institutions, and groups involved in organized inter-communal violence have been identified as perpetrators. The CHRSS found that sexual violence has been instrumentalized as a reward and entitlement for armed actors. Near complete impunity for rape and sexual violence allows perpetrators to avoid accountability., Yasmin Sooka, Chair of the CHRSS, declared that, “it is outrageous and completely unacceptable that women’s bodies are systematically used on this scale as the spoils of war.” Political instability and armed conflict have been pervasive in South Sudan for the majority of its almost 11 years of independence. Although the overall level of violence against civilians reduced significantly during 2021, subnational and localized violence continued, particularly in Unity, Jonglei, Lakes, Warrap and Western Bahr el Ghazal states. The CHRSS concluded that rampant conflict-related sexual violence perpetrated against women and girls cannot be isolated from wider political violence, which is often characterized by brutal violations and abuses against civilians, including killings, abductions, torture and forced displacement., The government of South Sudan must urgently commit to the implementation of the outstanding provisions of the peace agreement, including the one aimed at halting sexual and gender-based violence. South Sudanese authorities should strengthen the judicial system and work to end impunity for all forms of sexual and gender-based violence. Given its invaluable role in monitoring and reporting on atrocity crimes and grave human rights violations in South Sudan, the HRC must renew the mandate of the CHRSS in full during the conclusion of the 49th session next week.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-293-myanmar-burma-ukraine-and-south-sudan

Pre-existing armed conflicts in multiple ethnic states have been inflamed by the systematic use of brutal methods by security forces., Hundreds of localized armed resistance groups have formed across the country, and there is now widespread violence in many areas that were previously stable., As a result, the country's humanitarian crisis continues to expand. The economy is on the brink of collapse. Over 14.4 million individuals are now assessed as being in humanitarian need., UN partners indicate that food scarcity will sharply increase over the coming months, and UNDP has forecast that the combined impact of the coup and the COVID-19 pandemic could force nearly half of Myanmar’s population into poverty this year., Excellencies,, Harsh repression of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, expression and information– including Internet access – have not quelled the country's rejection of the coup. Most protests have been expressed peacefully, such as the Silent Strike organised by trade unions and others on Human Rights Day in December 2021, as well as many other forms of protest and boycotts., Regardless, the military has met all dissent - both acts of civil disobedience and acts of violence - in the same manner: with the use of lethal force, mass arbitrary arrests, and the use of torture. Credible sources have recorded the deaths of over 1,600 individuals, many engaged in peaceful protest. At least 350 of those killed died in military custody, over 21% of the total deaths., Since February 2021, over half a million people have been forced to flee their homes, with at least 15,000 recorded as fleeing the country. They add to the nearly 340,000 people internally displaced before February 2021 and over one million refugees, most of them Rohingya., Excellencies,, Disproportionate military responses to armed resistance have taken place with particular ferocity in Sagaing and Magway Regions, as well as in Chin, Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, and Shan States. Tatmadaw have targeted both armed resistance groups and civilians with helicopter gunships, airstrikes, and the use of indiscriminate force. Across the country, the military has employed a so-called “four-cuts” strategy to punish local communities for their assumed support to armed elements., These attacks have occurred alongside mass arrests, summary executions and torture., Such operations resemble those employed in Rakhine State in 2016 and 2017. Over 400 Tatmadaw attacks on populated areas involved property destruction, destroying thousands of houses and other buildings including churches and food stores and laying of landmines. The World Health Organization has also recorded at least 286 attacks on health-care facilities and personnel since February 2021., Across Sagaing Region, the military’s attempt to crush all opposition to it has intensified with heightened attacks against civilians. In Pale Township alone, Tatmadaw troops burned up to 2,000 houses, food stores and other buildings across eight villages in late January and February this year. Over 171,000 people are now displaced, many sheltering in the jungle with unmet basic needs and no homes to return to., Military operations increasingly rely on indiscriminate shelling and airstrikes in Kayah State, including on populated areas in Loikaw and Demoso Townships. This has killed and injured civilians including displaced people, children and a humanitarian worker, and has destroyed homes and other property including churches. On 24 December 2021, in Hsupro Township, military forces allegedly killed and burned up to 40 civilians – including four children and two humanitarian workers. Since then, continuing conflict has displaced more than half the population of the state capital Loikaw., Such operations clearly violate international human rights and humanitarian law., Excellencies,, Myanmar is increasingly at risk of state collapse, with shattered economic, education, health, and social protection systems. Collapse of the health system has had devastating consequences for Myanmar’s COVID-19 response. The country's precious development gains have been destroyed by conflict and the military’s abuse of power., I remain acutely concerned for the safety and rights of human rights defenders and other civil society actors. There is virtually no civic space left across the country. Intense surveillance, including by digital means, amplifies the danger to activists in all military-controlled areas., Military authorities systematically use arrests and detentions as a tool to target and intimidate people who oppose them. Credible sources indicate that security forces have detained over 12,500 individuals, of whom 9,500 remain in detention including at least 240 children. Many of these individuals have been reportedly subjected to ill-treatment amounting to torture. This has reportedly included suspension from the ceiling without food or water; being forced to stand in solitary confinement for extended periods; electrocution, sometimes alongside injection of unidentified drugs; sexual violence, including rape; and forcing Muslim detainees to ingest pork., The plight of the Rohingya people – a population persecuted for decades - remains dire, with no solution in sight.

There are still no durable solutions for internally displaced people, nor are their conditions conducive to secure, sustainable, dignified and voluntary returns in Rakhine State., Excellencies,, Accountability remains crucial to any solution to this crisis.

Young people in Myanmar’s Rakhine State tackle ethnic divisions,News and Press Release,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,23 Mar 2022,"Youth groups made up of Rakhine and Rohingya members are coming up with solutions to shared challenges in Myanmar’s ethnically divided Rakhine State., By Reuben Lim Wende in Sittwe, Myanmar | 23 March 2022, On a blue-sky winter’s day in Myanmar’s western Rakhine State, hundreds of people from two neighbouring villages – one populated by ethnic Rakhine people and the other by the minority Rohingya ethnic group – stream into an open field. The atmosphere is cheerful and festive as crowds gather around a large makeshift sports ground., As a football match between teams made up of Rakhine and Rohingya players commences, Myint Swe looks on with pride. “It took several weeks of planning for us to organize this event,” says the 32-year-old from Pyar La Chaung, the Rakhine village., Also watching from the sidelines is 20-year-old Maung Kyaw Maung from Pyin Chay, the Rohingya village that is 10 minutes away by foot from the Rakhine one. “Youths from both villages came together to make this possible,” he says., The duo is part of an eight-member youth group that organized the event. Officially called the Youth Development Committee, it is made up of four young people from the two villages who were elected by their respective communities to come up with solutions to shared challenges and to organize joint activities like the football match., Stories of collaboration across ethnic lines are relatively rare in Rakhine State, where ethnic and religious divisions have long impacted intercommunal relations. While the region has been largely spared the violence experienced in other parts of Myanmar following the military takeover of 1 February 2021, historical wounds from previous conflicts have yet to fully heal., There have been several waves of violence and displacement since the early 1990s. Among the most significant were intercommunal violence in 2012 and, five years later, the crisis that forced more than 740,000 Rohingya to flee across the border to Bangladesh. In total, some 1.6 million Rohingya are living as refugees, mainly in Bangladesh, Malaysia and India. Another 148,000 out of 600,000 Rohingya remaining in Myanmar are displaced across Rakhine State., Their prospects for being able to return home in the near future remain slim. In addition to the continued insecurity affecting both the Rohingya and the Rakhine communities, Rakhine State is a region with limited economic opportunities., The Rohingya live in particularly precarious conditions after decades of being denied basic rights, including citizenship, freedom of movement and access to basic services such as education and health care. While improvements to living conditions have been made in the last decade, there has been no tangible progress in the areas of citizenship and documentation., As part of efforts to address these challenges, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has been working with partners to foster greater social cohesion between the two ethnic groups, and reduce the likelihood of future intercommunal violence., The successful organization of the sports day event involving the Rakhine and Rohingya villages is the culmination of a year-long rural youth empowerment project run by ACTED, an international NGO and partner of UNHCR., “Youths play a special role in shaping intercommunal dynamics,” explains Htin Kyaw Min, a project manager at ACTED. “They can act as changemakers in strengthening dialogue, decision-making, and conflict resolution, not only within, but also between their communities.”, “We have a lot in common.”, The Youth Development Committee Maung Kyaw Maung and Myint Swe are part of, is one of six established by ACTED under the project. Members of each group are given training on leadership, peacebuilding, business development, vocational skills and first aid, among other things. They then work with village elders and administrators to identify needs and implement joint solutions benefitting both communities., The training has inspired members to come up with income-generating activities that serve both their communities. “The business development training gave us the idea to buy tables and chairs which are used for community events like today’s sports day. When not in use, we plan to rent them out to other villages to generate some income,” says Myint Swe. “We want to use the money earned to finish construction of a road linking both our villages.”, By promoting social integration and economic empowerment for both the Rakhine and Rohingya communities, the youth empowerment project aims to foster conditions that will help restore the fundamental rights of the Rohingya and pave the way for them to return home safely., “We have a lot in common,” says Myint Swe, noting that both villages lack education, but especially the Rohingya one. “We try our best to help one another gain more skills. Knowledge is very important and helps to maintain peace.”, “Previously, interaction between our villages was less frequent,” says Maung Kyaw Maung. “Now, we are on friendlier terms with each other.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/young-people-myanmar-s-rakhine-state-tackle-ethnic-divisions

Administrator Samantha Power on designation of atrocities against Rohingya as Genocide,News and Press Release,USAID,Protection and Human Rights,21 Mar 2022,"Today, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken announced that the United States has determined that the Burmese military committed genocide and crimes against humanity against the Rohingya people., All of us are grateful for the committed and forceful advocacy of Rohingya survivors of this genocide---survivors who have already demonstrated unimaginable resilience and bravery in the face of horror---as well as a range of organizations who have worked to document the Burmese military's crimes. Genocide is the intentional attempt to destroy a group of people, and the evidence that the Burmese military sought to eradicate the Rohingya is extensive and searing. As a result of the military's atrocities, women were forced to gather their families and flee under cover of darkness. Young children witnessed their families slaughtered, and their parents assaulted. From Burma to Bangladesh, hundreds of thousands of survivors have left behind the lives they knew, forced to choose the uncertainty of escape over the certain death of staying behind., Today's genocide determination is an important step in bringing accountability on behalf of Rohingya survivors and victims. As Secretary Blinken noted, the United States is supporting the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar and sharing information with The Gambia to support the case it is pursuing against Burma under the Genocide Convention at the International Court of Justice. The United States is also the world's leading donor in providing the survivors of this genocide with life-saving assistance. We provide urgent humanitarian assistance to nearly one million Rohingya refugees who currently live in Bangladesh---in the world's largest refugee settlement in Cox's Bazar district---as well as the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya and millions of other conflicted-affected people who remain in Burma., Working alongside our partners, USAID and the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration will continue to provide food, livelihoods, nutrition, and protection services, among other assistance, to millions of refugees, IDPs and host community members throughout Burma and across the Cox's Bazar district. And we will continue to do everything possible to support the 620,000 ethnic Rohingya who remain in Rakhine State in Burma where their lives continue to be severely restricted., In recognizing these atrocities as genocide, we acknowledge not just the horrific nature of the violence perpetrated by the Burmese military, but our obligation to support the Rohingya in their pursuit of justice., Office of Press Relations press@usaid.gov",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/administrator-samantha-power-designation-atrocities-against-rohingya-genocide

Myanmar: Momentum for justice as US to label Rohingya crackdown genocide,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,21 Mar 2022,"Responding to reports that the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to announce that Myanmar’s military has committed genocide and crimes against humanity during its violent campaign against the Rohingya minority, Erwin van der Borght, Amnesty International’s Interim Regional Director, said:, “Nearly five years after 740,000 people were driven from their homes at gunpoint in 2017, Rohingya families and survivors have yet to receive justice for the unimaginable horrors inflicted upon them. Momentum for international justice must be accelerated to end the rampant culture of impunity in Myanmar, where no senior figures have ever faced the consequences of their appalling campaign against the Rohingya people., “Without accountability, Myanmar’s military will continue to believe it has a blank check to murder innocent people, bomb their homes, and destroy their families. Amnesty International supports the call for the investigation and prosecution of senior military officials for crimes under international law in Myanmar, which include crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide., “The same generals who implemented the authorities’ brazen campaign of bloodshed against the Rohingya seized power in a 2021 coup. In response to a nationwide protest movement, they then turned their weapons on youth protesters in Myanmar’s biggest cities, deploying violent tactics previously used to target ethnic minorities for decades.”, Background:, The administration of US President Joe Biden is set to formally declare on 21 March that the Myanmar military’s 2017 campaign against the Rohingya amounted to genocide and crimes against humanity. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to make the announcement at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum., Myanmar’s military drove out more than 740,000 Rohingya from Rakhine State into Bangladesh in a brutal campaign of extrajudicial killings, arson and sexual assault. An estimated one million Rohingya refugees now live in Bangladesh, and many of their homes back in Rakhine State have been wiped from the map., The UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar previously called for Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and other senior officials to be investigated and prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Min Aung Hlaing seized power in a coup in the early hours of 1 Feb. 2021., There are multiple international efforts to provide justice to the Rohingya people, including a genocide case brought by The Gambia against Myanmar in the International Court of Justice (ICJ). A separate case is ongoing in Argentina under the concept of universal jurisdiction., Amnesty International has called on the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court., In 2017, Amnesty International’s research in Rakhine State detailed a vicious system of institutionalized discrimination and segregation that severely restricted the human rights of the minority Rohingya Muslims. This system – amounting to apartheid – threatens and undermines freedom of movement, ability to access adequate food and healthcare, and right to an education.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-momentum-justice-us-label-rohingya-crackdown-genocide
"Human Rights Council Holds Interactive Dialogue with Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, Hears Presentation on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and Starts General Debate on Human Rights Situations that Require the Council’s Attention",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,21 Mar 2022,"The Human Rights Council this afternoon held an interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, heard the presentation of an oral update on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and began a general debate on its agenda item four on human rights situations that require the Council’s attention., Thomas Andrews, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, said he regretted to inform the Human Rights Council that since his last report, the human right situation in Myanmar had not only failed to improve, it had deteriorated significantly. In fact, the Myanmar junta’s war against the people of Myanmar had intensified. The generals responsible for these escalating horrors were guilty of crimes against humanity, including the crimes of murder, enslavement, displacement and forcible transfer, enforced disappearance, torture, rape, and sexual violence. The international community and all Member States of the United Nations must stand with and for the people of Myanmar with not only words, but even more importantly, with action., In the discussion on Myanmar, speakers said the findings of the report were shocking and revealed the magnitude of the human rights crisis in Myanmar. The brutal and inhumane attacks must cease immediately, and all those arrested must be released. The attacks on civilians must cease immediately. The humanitarian crisis in the country had been deliberately exacerbated by attacks on humanitarian personnel and the blocking of humanitarian aid. These were blatant violations of international law. Those guilty of human rights violations must be held accountable. Some speakers said that the report contained biases and major imbalances with information from unsubstantiated sources. The Special Rapporteur had abused his status and stepped beyond his mandate by manipulating facts in an attempt to influence the work of United Nations bodies and serve the political agenda of certain countries, voiding his code of conduct and damaging further the situation on the ground., Ilze Brands Kehris, United Nations Assistant Secretary‑General for Human Rights, presented the oral update of the High Commissioner on the implementation of the recommendations made by the group of independent experts on accountability for human rights violations in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. She said that the Office continued to lay foundations for future accountability with respect to violations of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, including by gathering, analysing and preserving information on human rights violations in the country, some of which may rise to the level of international crimes. The Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea should commit to systemic reforms needed to end all human rights violations and to hold those responsible to account., The Council then held a general debate on agenda item four on human rights situations that require the Council’s attention. Some speakers said that the principles of universality, objectivity and impartiality should guide the Council’s work under this agenda item, and that all civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, should be treated equally. States had a primary responsibility to ensure the safety of internally displaced persons in situations of armed conflict, including their return and full restoration of their human rights. The Council should remain aware of the devastating impact of terrorism, hold accountable the countries that supported terrorist groups, and work to limit the impact of terrorists on human rights. The Council had a duty to take meaningful actions to combat the rise of racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and hate speech, particularly online., Speaking on Myanmar were European Union, Pakistan (on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation), Sweden (on behalf of a group of countries), Liechtenstein, Libya, United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Maldives, Japan, France, Venezuela, Luxembourg, China, Indonesia, Australia, Ireland, Republic of Korea, Bangladesh, United States, Serbia, Belgium, Turkey, Czech Republic, Albania, Malawi, New Zealand, Canada, Timor-Leste, Sierra Leone and Gambia., Also speaking were Access Now, Human Rights Now, Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development, Centre pour les Droits Civiques et Politiques, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, Human Rights Watch, Lawyers Rights Watch Canada, the International Federation For Human Rights League (FIDH), the European Center for Law and Justice and the Meezaan Center for Human Rights,, Speaking in the general debate on agenda item four were: France (on behalf of the European Union), Pakistan (on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation), Poland (on behalf of a group of countries), China (on behalf of a group of countries), Azerbaijan (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement), Morocco (on behalf of the group of Arab States), Venezuela (on behalf of a group of countries), Germany, Finland, Luxembourg, China, France, Venezuela, Cuba, Japan, India, Netherlands, Armenia, Pakistan, Indonesia, Lithuania, Russian Federation, Republic of Korea, United States, United Kingdom, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Sudan, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Philippines, Israel, Estonia, Spain, Switzerland and Austria., The webcast of the Human Rights Council meetings can be found here.

More than 1,600 civilians had now been killed by the junta; nearly 10,000 were now arbitrarily detained; more than half a million had been displaced since the coup began, bringing the number of internally displaced persons to well over 800,000; in the last two and a half months alone – since the beginning of this year - more than 4,500 homes and other civilian structures had been destroyed; basic human rights such as freedom of expression, assembly and association had been criminalised; many regions of the country that had not seen sustained fighting since World War II were now in a state of non-international armed conflict; and the 600,000 Rohingya remaining in Rakhine State after the military-led genocidal attacks in 2016-2017 were under constant threat, nearly a quarter of them confined in de facto internment camps while nearly all continued to be denied the right to citizenship, movement, and other fundamental rights., The generals responsible for these escalating horrors were guilty of crimes against humanity, including the crimes of murder, enslavement, displacement and forcible transfer, enforced disappearance, torture, rape, and sexual violence. Junta forces had also committed war crimes, including wilful killing, destruction of property, torture and inhumane treatment, pillaging, rape, and displacement of civilians, among other crimes. Of course, only a competent court could render such judgments with legal authority and international justice was sorely needed to hold those who were responsible for these horrible, ongoing crimes fully accountable., The consequences of the junta’s coup were being felt by tens of millions of people - nearly the entire population of Myanmar. The military junta had driven Myanmar into a humanitarian catastrophe marked by a crumbling health infrastructure, half the nation falling into poverty, rampant inflation, and the cruel and outrageous blocking of the delivery of aid to those in desperate need. It was critical to focus on the fact that the nightmare that continued to unfold in Myanmar, day in and day out, was happening to real people, real families whose lives were being crushed by a murderous junta. The military junta of Myanmar, and their accomplices, must be held accountable! The international community and all Member States of the United Nations must stand with and for the people of Myanmar with not only words, but even more importantly, with action. For the growing numbers of men, women and children in Myanmar, it was a matter of life and death., Discussion, In the ensuing interactive debate, speakers said the findings were shocking, and revealed the magnitude of the human rights crisis in Myanmar. The brutal and inhumane attacks must cease immediately, and all those arrested must be released. The attacks on civilians must cease immediately. The humanitarian crisis in the country had been deliberately exacerbated by attacks on humanitarian personnel and the blocking of humanitarian aid. These were blatant violations of international law. Those guilty of human rights violations must be held accountable. The acute suffering in the country could only end if Myanmar was brought back to the path of democracy, as highlighted by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in its Five Point Consensus. The attacks against the Rohingya Muslims were deplored, and concerns were expressed that no progress had been made to ensure their safe and voluntary return to their lands., Myanmar must cooperate with the United Nations and all relevant human rights mechanisms and implement all recommendations, including providing citizenship for the Rohingya and the return of all forcibly displaced persons. It was now more than a year since the brutal military coup, and in recent months the violence had escalated, with air strikes, torture, and attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure, all committed by the military forces. The continued repression of the right to freedom of speech, including the harassment of journalists and civil society, was also of great concern. The humanitarian crisis was only growing, and safe humanitarian access to international actors must be ensured., Some speakers said that country-specific mandates established without the agreement of the country concerned were against the spirit of consensus that should reign in the Council. The report contained biases and major imbalances with information from unsubstantiated sources. These politicised mandates impeded dialogue on the promotion and protection of human rights. It was important to bolster spaces for cooperation, as otherwise the efforts to consolidate democracy and strengthen human rights came to nothing. The Council should cease to hold these hostile mandates against countries of the South. They were an interference into the sovereignty of these countries. The Universal Periodic Review mechanism was the best place for dealing with country-specific issues. The absence of Myanmar at the meeting was saddening. The Special Rapporteur had abused his status and stepped beyond his mandate by manipulating facts in an attempt to influence the work of United Nations bodies and serve the political agenda of certain countries, voiding his code of conduct and damaging further the situation on the ground. He should stay within his mandate and within the principles of objectivity and impartiality, and work to stabilise the situation in Myanmar., Concluding Remarks, THOMAS ANDREWS, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, said that he appreciated the thoughtful comments and questions. On the role of the international community to reduce the violent attacks against freedom of expression in Myanmar, the Special Rapporteur said that in the absence of a Security Council resolution issuing an arms embargo, Member States should hold arms deliveries and reduce revenue transfer with more economic sanctions. It took considerable revenue to supply and equip the military structure. Mr. Andrews said it was necessary to create a multinational task force to identify, hunt down and freeze the assets of Myanmar, as Myanmar’s assets belonged to the people of Myanmar, and they were being used to attack the rightful owner of these assets, the people of Myanmar. The national liberty government should be recognised as the representative of the people of Myanmar. Member States should support the efforts to hold perpetrators of atrocities to account. States that had universal jurisdiction should make preparations to file charges against Myanmar’s security officials. They should support filing under the International Criminal Court and ensure the full funding of the United Nations humanitarian response., The Special Rapporteur continued to believe that a comprehensive resolution, including sanctions under the International Criminal Court, should be put in front of the Security Council, or at least one prohibiting the transfer of weapons to Myanmar as well as sanctions against entities which imported and exported weapons to Myanmar. Arms facilitators should be sanctioned. International investors should examine the extent to which their investments supported the atrocities and how they could prevent and mitigate their human rights impacts, including terminating those investments if needed. On the criticism addressed to the Council and his mandate, he stated, ""with all due respect"", that he stood by the facts in his report and specified that he would address any criticism. The report was within his mandate and his responsibility. The arms deal that he had documented had resulted in horrible violations of human rights and it was his responsibility to document them as well as address progress on the recommendations of the Fact-Finding Mission. His report was not based on speculation, it was based on facts and facts spoke for themselves., Concerning the situation of the Rohingya, Mr. Andrews said that 600,000 of them in Rakhine state continued to have their human rights violated, facing restrictions that could have life or death consequences, given the current conditions. He considered the situation in Rakhine state to be unconducive for the return of refugees in Bangladesh. He hoped to travel to countries belonging to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in the coming months to hear their vision of the situation. He fully supported the Five Point Consensus. The Special Rapporteur further welcomed the collaboration with the European Union envoy and reiterated that Member States should consider him as a source of information and recommendations. Concluding by addressing the impact of the military coup on children, the Special Rapporteur specified that the crisis in public health would have a long-term impact on the development of children and that the violation of their human rights may account to war crimes or crimes against humanity. Some 188 children were detained as political prisoners because they had participated in peaceful protests. Some had been tortured and denied medical care. He was further extremely concerned over the recruitment of child soldiers and the use of children as human shields. The collapse of health care services would have a devastating impact on children, such as the lack of routine immunisation, which could result in 33,000 deaths this year., Presentation of the Oral Update of the High Commissioner on the Implementation of the Recommendations made by the Group of Independent Experts on Accountability for Human Rights Violations in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, ILZE BRANDS KEHRIS, United Nations Assistant Secretary‑General for Human Rights, presenting the oral update of the High Commissioner on the implementation of the recommendations made by the group of independent experts on accountability for human rights violations in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, said the Office continued to lay foundations for future accountability with respect to violations of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, including by gathering, analysing and preserving information on human rights violations in the country, some of which may rise to the level of international crimes. It had taken forward processes of gathering information on specific violations, in particular by interviewing escapees from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Over the last year, there had been a significant reduction in the number of escapees leaving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, principally as a result of COVID-19 related restrictions. Member States with escapees on their territory should ensure full and unhindered access for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to them, in particular recent arrivals. Persons repatriated to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea faced a significant likelihood of torture and other serious human rights violations. Member States should provide them with full protection against the risk of refoulement and safe pathways in accordance with international human rights and refugee law obligations., Information received by the Office of the High Commissioner continued to suggest that there were reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity had been committed in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and may be ongoing. The Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea should commit to systemic reforms, end all human rights violations, and hold those responsible to account. An acknowledgment of the existence of serious human rights violations was a first step to this end. In the absence of any such commitment, however, it was incumbent on the international community to pursue accountability avenues, whether through referral to the International Criminal Court, or the establishment of an ad hoc tribunal or another comparable mechanism. Member States should also consider supporting complementary approaches at national levels, including criminal proceedings in accordance with international standards under accepted principles of extraterritorial and universal jurisdiction, and relevant civil litigation. Long-term peace and stability on the Korean peninsula could only be achieved if victims’ rights to truth, justice and accountability for violations suffered in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea were addressed adequately and in a timely manner., General Debate on Human Rights Situations that Require the Council’s Attention, In the general debate, speakers said that the principles of universality, objectivity and impartiality should guide the Council’s work under this agenda item, and all civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, should be treated equally. Local situations and challenges should be considered in this regard. The Council should aim to ensure dialogue and cooperation. Selective applications of the agenda item were of concern: each situation should be dealt with on its own merit, and not from a politicised approach. The promotion and protection of human rights and the commitment to fulfil obligations to ensure the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all should be ensured from a non-selective perspective., The Council needed to function in a non-politicised, cooperative and objective manner. Country-selective mandates ran counter to the Charter of the Council and ran counter to human rights issues. The Universal Periodic Review was one of the founding mechanisms of the Human Rights Council to address human rights issues, putting all countries on an equal footing in a spirit of cooperation and harmonious discussion, and this was the tool for discussion of such issues. A country’s human rights record must be judged by the inhabitants of the country, and not by the standards of others. Human rights had become a bargaining chip, and this should be reversed., States had a primary responsibility to ensure the safety of internally displaced persons in situations of armed conflict, including their return and full restoration of their human rights. Post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts were vital for continued peace. The impact of terrorism and conflict on the right to life of persons globally was of concern, as it posed a serious threat to democracy and the rule of law. The Council should remain aware of the devastating impact of terrorism, hold accountable the countries that supported terrorist groups, and work to limit the impact on human rights., The Council should promote and protect the fundamental freedoms and human rights of Muslim persons and communities against the rise of Islamophobia worldwide. The Council had a duty to take meaningful action to combat the rise of racism, xenophobia and hate speech, particularly online. Human rights should be promoted and protected without discrimination or ambiguity., The Council should also actively monitor and report on the conditions of foreign occupations and disputes in those countries involved. Everyone had the right to respect of the law by all and without discrimination. Contempt for international humanitarian law and international human rights law was inexcusable, and attacks on civilian infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals, constituted war crimes. All countries should ensure that they fully respected international humanitarian law and international human rights law. World-wide civic space was rapidly being restricted, and this should be combatted effectively to ensure that civil society had sufficient space to operate freely. This restriction was being seen in too many countries around the world. Democracy must be supported, and all States should repeal laws restricting civil space and ensure a space, both offline and online, where civil society could pursue their activities free from violence and threats of violence., The situation of indigenous rights in some countries was also of concern, as in the past they had seen violations of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, with their land taken, and their culture forcibly eliminated. Indigenous children were forcibly taken from their families and interned in schools, where they died unnatural deaths. Indigenous peoples in many countries were subject to systemic discrimination and inequality, marginalised at the bottom of society. Their situation had further deteriorated due to the impact of the pandemic. Countries involved should act immediately, investigate thoroughly, hold the guilty accountable, provide reparations, and ensure that such situations could not be repeated by taking all necessary measures to eliminate discrimination., The situation of women and girls in many countries was of great concern, where they faced sexual assault, trafficking, and other serious human rights violations. In the context of the global fight against the pandemic, health workers should be recognised as human rights workers, and they should be defended as such., Produced by the United Nations Information Service in Geneva for use of the information media; not an official record.

High Commissioner says accountability remains crucial to any solution to the crisis in Myanmar and Special Rapporteur urges the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to stop crimes against humanity like the political prison camps,News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,21 Mar 2022,"MORNING, The Human Rights Council this morning discussed the situation of human rights in Myanmar and in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. It heard the High Commissioner say that the human rights of the people of Myanmar were in profound crisis and that accountability remained crucial to any solution to the crisis in Myanmar. The Council also heard the Special Rapporteur speak about the most serious human rights violations in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the need to pursue accountability, urging a stop of crimes against humanity like the political prison camps in the country., Michelle Bachelet, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that the human rights of the people of Myanmar were in profound crisis. Myanmar was increasingly at risk of State collapse, with shattered economic, education, health, and social protection systems. The High Commissioner remained acutely concerned for the safety and rights of human rights defenders and other civil society actors. Military authorities systematically used arrests and detentions as a tool to target and intimidate people who opposed them. The plight of the Rohingya people – a population persecuted for decades - remained dire, with no solution in sight. In conclusion, the High Commissioner stated that accountability remained crucial to any solution to this crisis., In the ensuing debate on Myanmar, some speakers welcomed the efforts of the High Commissioner’s Office to assess the gravity of human rights violations in Myanmar. Calls were made for an immediate end to violence against the civilian population and for the release of all political prisoners. Speakers condemned any discrimination against minorities, as well as the systematic use of violence and arbitrary detentions, torture and enforced disappearances. Speakers condemned the military coup. Some speakers regretted that Myanmar, as a country concerned, was unable to participate in the dialogue and supported all parties to find a political solution through dialogue to restore social stability and to restart the democratic process in the country. Multilateral institutions such as the Human Rights Council should help Myanmar to solve the current situation rather than supporting external intervention., Speaking during the discussion on Myanmar were the European Union, Pakistan on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Conference, Canada, Germany, Malaysia, Luxembourg, Viet Nam, China, Spain, Netherlands, Russian Federation, Cambodia, Indonesia, Australia, Mauritania, Bangladesh, Romania, United Kingdom, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, India, Switzerland, Gambia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and France., Also speaking were Human Rights Commission of Malaysia, Edmund Rice International Limited, Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development, Centre for Civil and Political Rights, Baptist World Alliance, International Humanist and Ethical Union, Article 19 International Centre Against Censorship, International Bar Association, CIVICUS, Organization for Poverty Alleviation and Development, and International Commission of Jurists., The Council then held an interactive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea., Tomás Ojea Quintana, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, said that he had been consistent on the need to implement a two-track approach: highlighting the most serious human rights violations in the country and the need to pursue accountability, alongside offering constructive engagement with the Government to seek improvement of the human rights situation on the ground. It was imperative for the Government to cease ongoing crimes against humanity, including through the system of kwanliso (political prison camps), and to undertake a process of accountability. Cooperation actually allowed in recent years had led to some advancements in addressing economic, social and cultural rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea., In the ensuing discussion, some speakers shared the great concerns expressed in the Special Rapporteur’s report and called on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to fully engage with the mandate. Regrettably the report only confirmed what was already known, which was that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea violated its citizens’ human rights and basic freedom. They deplored the attitude of a regime which cut off all links with the outside world, including access to humanitarian aid. Some speakers commended the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea for the promotion and protection of the human rights of its population and denounced a report based on disinformation. They were opposed to specific mandates against countries, particularly when the country concerned did not consent to them., Speaking in the interactive dialogue on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea were European Union, Norway on behalf of Nordic-Baltic countries, Liechtenstein, Cuba, Syria, Venezuela, France, China, Switzerland, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Australia, Ireland, Republic of Korea, Belarus, United States, United Kingdom, Zimbabwe, Czech Republic, Albania, Nicaragua, Viet Nam, South Sudan, Burundi, Eritrea, Lao People’s Democratic Republic New Zealand, Iran and Japan., Also speaking were Christian Solidarity Worldwide, Human Rights Watch, UN Watch, Ingenieurs du Monde, and People for Successful Korean Reunification., The webcast of the Human Rights Council meetings can be found here. All meeting summaries can be found here. Documents and reports related to the Human Rights Council’s forty-ninth regular session can be found here., The Council will reconvene at 3 p.m. this afternoon to hold separate interactive dialogues with the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, and with the High Commissioner on her oral update on the implementation of the recommendations made by the group of independent experts on accountability for human rights violations in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. It will then hold a general debate on agenda item four on human rights situations that require the Council’s attention., Interactive Dialogue with the High Commissioner on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar, Documentation, The Council has before it (A/HRC/49/72) report of the High Commissioner on the human rights situation in Myanmar since 1 February 2021, Presentation of Report, MICHELLE BACHELET, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that 13 months after the military coup of 1 February 2021, the human rights of the people of Myanmar were in profound crisis. Harsh repression of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, expression and information – including Internet access – had not quelled the country's rejection of the coup. Most protests had been expressed peacefully, regardless, the military had met all dissent - both acts of civil disobedience and acts of violence - in the same manner: with the use of lethal force, mass arbitrary arrests, and the use of torture. Since February 2021, over half a million people had been forced to flee their homes, with at least 15,000 recorded as fleeing the country. They added to the nearly 340,000 people internally displaced before February 2021 and over one million refugees, most of them Rohingya., Ms. Bachelet said that Myanmar was increasingly at risk of State collapse, with shattered economic, education, health, and social protection systems. The collapse of the health system had had devastating consequences for Myanmar’s COVID-19 response. The country's precious development gains had been destroyed by conflict and the military’s abuse of power. The High Commissioner remained acutely concerned for the safety and rights of human rights defenders and other civil society actors. Military authorities systematically used arrests and detentions as a tool to target and intimidate people who opposed them. The plight of the Rohingya people – a population persecuted for decades - remained dire, with no solution in sight., In conclusion, the High Commissioner said that accountability remained crucial to any solution to this crisis. Human rights violations and crimes being committed today by Myanmar's military forces were built upon the impunity with which they perpetrated the slaughter of the Rohingya four years ago – and other, similar, operations against ethnic minorities over many previous decades. Clearly, there would need to be a political pathway to restore democracy and civilian rule. But such dialogue could not and would not displace the urgent need to hold to account those responsible for severe human rights violations. The people of Myanmar deserved, and overwhelmingly demanded, justice. Ms. Bachelet urged stronger efforts to advance tangible results from the five-point consensus achieved by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in April 2021 as so far, there had been little progress., Discussion, In the ensuing debate, speakers thanked the High Commissioner for her report and welcomed the efforts of her Office to assess the gravity of human rights violations in Myanmar. Cases of discrimination were on the rise. The persecution of minorities was increasing the risk to the security of the entire region. Speakers called for an immediate end to violence against civilian populations and for the release of all political prisoners. They condemned any discrimination against minorities, as well as the systematic use of violence and arbitrary detentions, torture and enforced disappearances. Such blatant violations were condemned and concerns over violence against civilians and human rights defenders were expressed. Speakers condemned the military coup. They expressed concerns over the level of violence and called on the military leadership to end all forms of violence, to ensure accountability and to end impunity for all human rights violations., Some speakers urged the de facto authority to respect the Human Rights Council and all other United Nations mechanisms, fully cooperate with them, and cease reprisal against those mechanisms. The scale of human rights violations exacerbated the tragedy faced by the Rohingya population. Humanitarian access should be free and unhindered. Concerns over the supply of weapons to Myanmar were expressed. The international community should cease all transfers of weapons to Myanmar. Member States were urged to prevent the sale of weapons and military assistance to Myanmar. The army was continuing its brutal oppression instead of respecting international humanitarian law., Some speakers regretted that Myanmar, as a country concerned, was unable to participate in the dialogue and supported all parties to find a political solution through dialogue to restore social stability and to restart the democratic process in the country. The current problem in Myanmar was for the people of Myanmar to solve and external pressure would only be counterproductive. Multilateral institutions such as the Human Rights Council should help Myanmar to solve the current situation rather than support external intervention. Speakers supported the efforts of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and reiterated the importance of a prosperous and peaceful Myanmar. They were supportive of the constructive role of the Association to work with Myanmar to advance the implementation of the consensus., Concluding Remarks on Myanmar, MICHELLE BACHELET, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, responding to the question on what more could be done to prevent a further spiral of human rights violations in Myanmar, including against women and children, said she was concerned about this, and the impact it could have across the country, and the Office had observed increasingly brutal tactics and use of heavy power. Villages were being razed to the ground. Women in detention were experiencing violation and degrading treatment, including torture, and both men and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons had been sexually assaulted at police stations. Children had been detained in various areas; some were being prosecuted and two had been given the death penalty. Steps had been identified to end the spiral: to stop the military oppression, to release detainees, and to restore democracy, among others. It was important for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to support this. The report set out clear additional actionable recommendations that could assist the people of Myanmar and which highlighted the actions that the international community could take, including sanctions on military-linked economic interests. It was important for all stakeholders in the democratic movement and ethnic groups to be consulted in any efforts to solve the situation., There had been a complete breakdown of the national system to ensure economic and social rights: millions had lost their jobs, the price of basic commodities had soared, and public health care systems were collapsing. Women teachers had gone without pay. There was an urgent need for humanitarian assistance in all parts of Myanmar. It was important to ensure the maximum involvement of civil society and humanitarian organizations in delivering aid, as they enjoyed the recognition of the people. Accountability should be ensured for serious human rights violations, as well as international crimes, which should be addressed as a solution for any sustainable political situation in the country. There should be a comprehensive transitional justice policy, ensuring the rights of victims and allowing victims to make their voices heard. The Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar was aiding this in the context of international standards. The different processes involved should collaborate to avoid overlap, and to ensure accountability in full. The High Commissioner said she fully supported the call for the creation of a conducive, dignified and sustainable return of the Rohingya to their own lands. There would be no sustainable solution unless these key issues could be addressed., Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Documentation, The Council has before it (A/HRC/49/74) report of the Special Rapporteuron the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Tomás Ojea Quintana., Presentation of Report, TOMÁS OJEA QUINTANA, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, said that over the past six years, he had raised concerns about the coercive system of governance that deprived the fundamental freedoms of the people in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. He had been consistent on the need to implement a two-track approach: highlighting the most serious human rights violations in the country and the need to pursue accountability, alongside offering constructive engagement with the Government to seek the improvement of the human rights situation on the ground. It was imperative for the Government to cease ongoing crimes against humanity, including through the system of kwanliso (political prison camps), and to undertake a process of accountability. Until that happened, efforts should be pursued to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court or to create an ad hoc tribunal or comparable mechanism to determine individual criminal responsibility. Alternatives based on principles of universal or extraterritorial jurisdiction should also be tried, while preserving information that may be used in future processes needed to continue. Accountability also involved developing a historical record, memorialisation, reparation, and truth-telling exercises, which were necessary to guarantee the rights of victims., Cooperation actually allowed in recent years had led to some advancements in addressing economic, social and cultural rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the rights of persons with disabilities, the plight of Korean separated families, and the Japanese abductions issue, among others, the Special Rapporteur said. The participation of the Government over the past six years in some United Nations mechanisms and training activities should be acknowledged and built upon to maximise space for cooperation in areas such as conditions in detention and the treatment of detainees, food, health, water and sanitation, adequate housing and labour standards. Mr. Ojea Quintana believed that the ongoing deterioration of the human rights situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was linked to the country’s ever-increasing isolation from the international community. At this point in time, the crucial challenge was to not recreate a new cycle of escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula, which could rapidly and dangerously destabilise the region. In his view, a diplomatic approach towards peace and the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, which would build upon previous negotiations and was combined with proactive engagement on the human rights situation, was the only way forward., Discussion, In the ensuing discussion, speakers shared the great concerns expressed in the Special Rapporteur’s report and called on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to fully engage with the mandate. They condemned the country’s lack of respect for the fundamental human rights of its population. Regrettably, the report only confirmed what was already known, which was that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea violated its citizens’ human rights and basic freedoms. Every simple act or gesture was controlled in order to prevent acts of dissent. Speakers were frustrated at the lack of progress when it came to improving the human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, which was witnessing serious and systematic violations, and exaggerated isolation. They deplored the attitude of a regime which had cut off all links with the outside world, including access of humanitarian aid., Speakers called on the authorities to put a stop to all human rights violations and resume cooperation with the United Nations. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea showed little signs of decreasing the exaggerated isolation of its population which started at the beginning of the pandemic and this was concerning. The complete closure of the borders had exacerbated the challenges faced by the country. The situation continued to be dire every day. Speakers urged the Government to allow full access to humanitarian aid. The necessity to open the borders to allow the evacuation of people for medical reasons was highlighted. There was no rule of law, no free elections, no free media and no free civil society. The Government should work more closely with the human rights system., Some speakers denounced discriminatory mechanisms such as country specific mandates and highlighted that the Universal Periodic Review should be the path forward to tackle human rights violations. They were against selective and politically motivated resolutions and mandates such as the one on Myanmar. Mechanisms imposed against the will of States concerned only contributed to manipulating human rights. Country specific initiatives were known to fail. Speakers regretted the report’s lack of impartiality and called on the Special Rapporteur to stop this unconstructive approach. Calls for the lifting of the unilateral coercive measures that harmed the economic development of Myanmar and violated its people human rights were made. Myanmar’s sovereignty needed to be respected., Interim Remarks, TOMÁS OJEA QUINTANA, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, regretted that there was no representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the meeting, and a complete lack of cooperation in any way. This needed to change, as it was connected to the dialogue between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, as well as with international bodies. The level of isolation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was concerning, as it ensured that there was no space for dialogue. The Government had taken a range of measures that had had a considerable impact on not only economic, social and cultural rights but also civil and political rights. The international community should ensure full engagement, including to ensure full vaccination of the people against COVID-19., It was up to the Government to accept the aid of the international community, and this would hopefully ensure the opening of the borders and the return of the humanitarian agencies and the United Nations country team, which presently could not carry out operations on the ground. The Special Rapporteur said his last report to the Council included a road map and hoped that the Office of the High Commissioner would take account of that. He hoped the report would serve as a catalyst for all thematic mandates in interacting with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. He encouraged thematic Rapporteurs, such as the one on water and sanitation, to develop and continue a relationship with the Government. Ultimately, the responsibility lay with the Government to promote and protect the human rights of its people. The Council would not allow crimes against humanity to continue: for that, it did not only require statements, or even resolutions, but concrete acts and measures on accountability; this was crucial to deter and prevent ongoing crimes against humanity within the country., Discussion, Some speakers welcomed the report and endorsed its recommendations. They were gravely concerned about the further deterioration of the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. as well as the prolonged border closure. They called for full access to medical staff involved in the COVID-19 response. Concerns were expressed about the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea laws on reactionary thought and culture, which included the death penalty for access to foreign content. There was no freedom of thoughts and Christians were particularly at risk. Defectors who returned faced violence and execution. The speakers said the Special Rapporteur had a critical role to play and must hold the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to account., Some speakers commended the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea for the promotion and protection of the human rights of its population and denounced a report based on disinformation. The Human Rights Council should not be used to impose pressure on the international affairs of States. The speakers were opposed to specific mandates against countries, particularly when the country concerned did not consent to them. Country specific mandates did not produce the intended outcome in terms of improvement of promotion and protection of human rights. Speakers did not recognise the dubious methods of preparing a report based on fake information and fake evidence. Calls were made on the Council to refrain from making politically motivated decisions. The Council should stop using double standards because it would only undermine the effective protection of human rights. The Universal Periodic Review was the only effective tool to protect human rights. Speakers urged countries to cease all unilateral coercive measures against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea., Concluding Remarks, TOMÁS OJEA QUINTANA, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said his report, which was his last one to the Council, acknowledged that the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea had taken the initiative to establish cooperation with the Human Rights Council. There was interaction with the Council in the context of the Universal Periodic Review, and there had been progress in reporting to treaty bodies, and there was also contact with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and a capacity-building session held in Geneva. This reflected the impartial nature of his report, which was drawn up using the principle of independence. He had stood ready to listen to the points of view of the authorities of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. It was important for all Special Rapporteurs and his mandate in particular - that the report reflected the point of view of the country concerned. His reports had always been completely impartial and based on his findings as an independent expert, and he had always shunned bias, selectivity, politicisation and double standards., Regarding the engagement of the authorities of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, these were relevant to other mandates as well. For this mandate, it would be important to establish a relationship with the countries surrounding the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as well. Trust must be built so that crucial issues could be addressed. He urged the neighbours of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and other countries in the region to develop contacts with the mandate. Regarding expectations of aid, for example food, the international community needed to know from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea what were their expectations, and transparent information was required. On the rights of women in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, this issue was addressed in the reports: there were in fact reports of wide-spread violations of women’s rights in the country, and this must be addressed in the dialogue with the authorities. The majority of escapees from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea had a tumultuous journey during which they were exposed to all sorts of human rights violations. Those working on human rights in the country were concerned about heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula. Tensions and isolation made it impossible to open up channels to discuss human rights, but diplomatic means must be used to open these up for the future. The Secretary-General must be empowered to play a more relevant role in diplomacy on the peninsula. It was frustrating to not be able to make more progress in the situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and the Human Rights Council must be able to overcome this frustration by using all the mechanisms at its disposal in the United Nations system., Link: https://www.ungeneva.org/en/news-media/meeting-summary/2022/03/conseil-des-droits-de-lhomme-plus-de-144-millions-de-personnes",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/high-commissioner-says-accountability-remains-crucial-any-solution-crisis-myanmar-and

Forty-ninth session
28 February–1 April 2022, Summary, The Myanmar junta is committing gross human rights violations against the people of Myanmar. It is bombing villages indiscriminately, forcibly displacing hundreds of thousands. Its troops have engaged in mass killings on numerous occasions and tortured dozens to death. It is criminalizing basic human rights, including the right to express dissent—both on the streets and online. It is actively committing probable crimes against humanity and war crimes., This paper examines a key aspect of the international community’s response to the Myanmar military’s illegal coup and these subsequent violations of international law – the supply of weapons to the military junta that are used to attack the people of Myanmar. It also makes recommendations to reduce the flow of weapons to the junta and save lives., The paper details known arms transfers from Member States to Myanmar since 2018, and in particular since the military coup on 1 February 2021, that could be used by the Myanmar military to attack civilians. The Special Rapporteur also discusses the legality of these transfers, applying international humanitarian law, customary international law related to state responsibility, and the Arms Trade Treaty, where applicable., As the Myanmar military’s attacks against civilians escalate, it is critical that Member States immediately consider how they might alter their response to this crisis. This can begin by examining the role of the Security Council and Member States since the junta’s coup one year ago. How have the actions, or inaction, of the Security Council and Member States contributed to the crisis in Myanmar? What changes can and must be made to save lives, reduce human suffering, and protect the human rights of the Myanmar people?, Amongst his recommendations, the Special Rapporteur urges the Security Council to impose a comprehensive arms embargo and targeted economic sanctions against the Myanmar military. At the very least, he urges Member States of the Security Council to immediately propose a resolution to stop the flow of weapons that are actively being used by the military junta to attack Myanmar civilians: jet aircraft, attack helicopters, armored vehicles, light and heavy artillery, missiles and rockets that can be used to target ground targets, artillery shells, and small arms. The choice between action and inaction is literally a matter of life and death.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/enabling-atrocities-arms-transfers-states-members-united-nations-myanmar-military
"UN expert: Myanmar people betrayed with ‘vague declarations’ and ‘tedious, endless wait’ for action",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,21 Mar 2022,"War crimes, crimes against humanity committed daily, says Tom Andrews, GENEVA (21 March 2022) – In the face of what he described as war crimes and crimes against humanity in Myanmar, a UN human rights expert today said the victims of these crimes see the international community’s failure to take strong, coordinated action as a betrayal., “War crimes and crimes against humanity are being committed every day with impunity by the military junta of Myanmar,” Tom Andrews, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, told the Human Rights Council in Geneva., “The people of Myanmar have been told that the world has a ‘responsibility to protect,’ victims of atrocity crimes, including crimes against humanity and war crimes. As the military junta escalates its ruthless attacks on the people of Myanmar, the people of Myanmar see only endless expressions of concern from the international community, vague declarations that something should be done and a tedious, endless wait for a consensus to act., “For nearly 14 months, this body and other UN bodies have held meetings, issued statements and passed non-binding resolutions. Some Member States have sanctioned individuals and entities linked to the Myanmar military junta. For the people of Myanmar, these are welcome but insufficient steps to hold to account those responsible for relentless attacks on the people of Myanmar that continue at this very moment.”, Andrews pointed to international action in light of the crisis in Ukraine as a standard by which its response to the crisis in Myanmar can be measured: “Those responsible for the attacks against the people of Ukraine faced severe targeted sanctions personally, and their country’s central bank was sanctioned even as foreign currency reserves were frozen,” he said. “In the space of four days Member States of the United Nations summoned the political will to take tangible action.”, Andrews said the military junta had murdered more than 1,600 civilians, detained more than 10,000, displaced more than half a million, destroyed more than 4,500 homes since the start of this year, spread armed conflict to regions previously at peace, and continued to systematically oppress and persecute the Rohingya in Rakhine State., “It is clear to me that the generals responsible for these escalating horrors are guilty of crimes against humanity, including the crimes of murder, enslavement, displacement and forcible transfer, enforced disappearance, torture, rape and sexual violence,” Andrews said., “I also believe that junta forces have committed war crimes including willful killing, destruction of property, torture and inhumane treatment, pillaging, rape, and displacement of civilians, among other crimes.”, In a report to the Council, Andrews highlighted the cost of the junta’s attacks on the people of Myanmar: “The military junta has driven Myanmar into a humanitarian catastrophe marked by a crumbling health infrastructure, half the nation falling into poverty, rampant inflation, and the cruel and outrageous blocking of the delivery of aid to those in desperate need.”, The UN expert expressed his outrage and horror regarding the junta’s attacks on children. “Children are being targeted and killed even as they run with their parents for safety. More than 100 have been murdered since the coup was launched last year. More than 100 children are gone, victims of the military junta’s ruthlessness, brutality, and cowardice., “As members of this Human Rights Council, a body that can serve as the conscience of the United Nations, I hope that most, if not all, of you are horrified and outraged as well.” Andrews added that nearly one million children have missed routine immunizations; this alone could result in the deaths of 33,000 children this year., Andrews implored the Council and its Member States to “stand with and for the people of Myanmar with not only words, but even more importantly, with action. Because for growing numbers of men, women and children in Myanmar, it is a matter of life and death.”, ENDS, Mr. Thomas Andrews (United States of America) is the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar. A former member of the US Congress from Maine, Andrews is a Robina Senior Human Rights Fellow at Yale Law School and an Associate of Harvard University’s Asia Center.

BROUK Welcomes US Rohingya Genocide Determination,News and Press Release,BROUK,Protection and Human Rights,21 Mar 2022,"The Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK) welcomes today’s determination by the United States’ Department of State that genocide has been committed against the Rohingya people., “The US determination of the crime of genocide against us is a momentous moment and must lead to concrete action to hold the Burmese military accountable for their crimes,” said Tun Khin, President of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK., In 2018, United States investigators produced a 15,000 page investigation documenting atrocities committed in 2017 against the Rohingya, which included more than 13,000 instances of “grave human rights violations”, including gang rapes, crucifixions, mutilations, and of children being burned or drowned, and of families being locked inside homes that had been set alight., Also in 2018 the United Nations Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar published the results of its investigation, finding that the human rights violations committed against the Rohingya amounted to genocide. In 2019 the Fact-Finding Mission stated that the genocide was ongoing., “This designation lets Rohingya know that their voices have been heard amid the cruel suffering they continue to endure,” said Tun Khin. “In Burma the Rohingya face denial of our identity, our rights and denial of the human rights violations committed against us. Rohingya faced genocide, one of the most terrible crimes imaginable, and then faced the international community not even acknowledging it had happened. Today the US has gone a long way to correcting that.”, Since the attempted military coup on 1st February 2021, the Burmese military has used deadly force across the country. Half a million people have been displaced and around 12,000 people arrested. 600,000 Rohingya remain in Burma and there are concerns that the military may once again whip up nationalist prejudice against the Rohingya in an attempt to deflect people from resistance to military rule., “There is no doubt that being allowed to get away with genocide of the Rohingya encouraged the military to think it could get away with holding a coup as well,” said Tun Khin. “Accountability for Rohingya genocide will not just help protect the Rohingya, it will help protect all the people of Burma.”, The Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK calls for the US and other countries to follow this determination with concrete action against the military.

U.S. Genocide Designation for Rohingya a ‘Profoundly Meaningful Step’ Toward Justice,News and Press Release,RI,Protection and Human Rights,20 Mar 2022,"Please see below statement from Refugees International Deputy Director for Africa, Asia, and the Middle East Daniel P. Sullivan:, “The United States will finally recognize the crimes committed against the Rohingya people for what they are: genocide and crimes against humanity. The U.S. genocide declaration is a welcome and profoundly meaningful step. It is also a solid sign of commitment to justice for all the people who continue to face abuses by the military junta to this very today., Rohingya refugees and diaspora have long called for this recognition, with the support of Members of Congress, legal experts, and advocacy groups like Refugees International alike. This is a day to celebrate a significant victory. But it is also time to redouble efforts to hold the perpetrators of that genocide accountable and to prevent future atrocities., The United States must now use the momentum of this genocide determination to spur concrete actions. While several steps have been taken to increase pressure on the Burmese junta since its coup in February 2021, effective global coordination is lacking. The United States must use the gravity of the genocide determination to lead a new diplomatic push, including with Myanmar’s neighbors in Southeast Asia, for further targeted sanctions, an arms embargo, and support for evidence collection and accountability efforts before the International Criminal Court and International Court of Justice., The United States can also show solidarity with Rohingya survivors by maintaining humanitarian assistance for the million Rohingya who have sought refuge in Bangladesh and by working with Bangladesh to offer resettlement to Rohingya refugees in the United States.”, Refugees International has urged U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to make a Rohingya genocide determination, including through a joint letter from 95 organizations. The letter builds on Refugees International’s efforts with the previous U.S. administration as part of the #CallitGenocide campaign, which included a nearly 9,000-signature petition and a legal and human rights experts letter (signed by two senior officials in the Biden administration).

The next humanitarian update will be issued in April 2022., HIGHLIGHTS & KEY MESSAGES, Civilians continue to bear the brunt of the conflict, which has further escalated in northwest and southeast Myanmar., As of 14 March 2022, there were an estimated 889,900 Internally Displaced People (IDPs) across Myanmar including 519,500 people newly displaced since the military takeover and 370,400 IDPs in protracted displacement from previous crises. Overall displacement figures fluctuated during the month in light of recent small-scale and often shortlived returns., Humanitarian actors continue providing critical lifesaving assistance to displaced people and host communities wherever they can, including through local partners amid serious access challenges.
Increasing challenges are being reported by clusters around transportation of supplies into conflict areas., An inter-agency mission in Kachin and northern Shan has identified significant response gaps and escalating needs due to protracted displacement from continuing armed confrontations between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs) and among different EAOs., Preparedness efforts and COVID-19 preventative supplies provided by humanitarian partners have contributed to management of the fourth wave in February. After a surge in February, new cases have slowed in early March., Additional funding for the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) which requests US$826 million to reach 6.2 million people in need of life-saving support is critical. Almost a quarter of the way into the year, a number of clusters are reporting major resource gaps with no funding yet received by some sectors in 2022., KEY FIGURES, 889.9K
Internally displaced persons across Myanmar, 519.5K
People currently displaced across Myanmar by clashes and insecurity since February 2021, 370K
People remain internally displaced in Rakhine, Kachin, Chin and Shan due to conflict before February 2021, 5.6K
Estimated civilian properties, including houses, churches, monasteries and schools burnt or destroyed since February 2021., SITUATION OVERVIEW, The security and humanitarian situations remained tense across Myanmar during the reporting period. Armed clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs), and People’s Defense Forces (PDFs) have continued unabated in multiple states and regions, with heavy weapons, including airstrikes and artillery fire in various locations, resulting in casualties among the civilian population, destruction of properties and further displacement., Civilians have been injured and killed by shelling, gunfire, landmines, explosive remnants of war (ERW), and unexploded ordnance (UXO). Since the military takeover, at least 1,600 people, including over 100 children, have been killed, and thousands injured or maimed according to OHCHR. Landmines and other ERW and UXO are an increasing concern as growing numbers of displaced people move through conflict areas. In 2021, 88 civilians, including 19 women and 19 children, were killed and another 196 people, including 33 women and 55 children, were injured from landmines and ERW, according to UNICEF. Shan State recorded the highest (38 per cent) of the total casualties, followed by Rakhine (17 per cent) and Kachin (18 per cent) states. Children represented 27 per cent of casualties from landmine and ERW incidents countrywide. In the past year, many families have been forced to flee their homes and villages, often more than once, for safety with a surge in displacement in January, February and early March 2022., Across Myanmar, as of 14 March 2022, 889,900 people remain displaced. This includes 519,500 people displaced by conflict and insecurity since 1 February. The majority of IDPs are women and girls. The fighting has also caused unprecedented destruction of civilian properties, including houses, across the country. As of 7 March 2022, more than 5,640 houses, churches, monasteries, schools, and markets had been either burnt down or destroyed across Myanmar, mainly in Chin and Kayah states and Sagaing and Magway regions., Prices for basic commodities have significantly increased compared to December 2021, building off an already highlevel post-takeover, largely due to increased fuel costs, deteriorating exchange rates, transport and import restrictions, and supply disruptions caused by insecurity, adding an additional burden on families. Between February 2021 and February 2022, the prices of basic food items increased by nearly 30 per cent across Myanmar. Nearly half the population (46 per cent) is estimated to be living in poverty in 2022 according to UNDP. COVID-19 continues to add additional suffering and complexity with a fourth wave still impacting the country, although case numbers have started to subside in early March. Women are carrying an unequal economic burden from both the pandemic and the political situation as households struggle to make ends meet. Reports from the World Bank and International Labour Organization (ILO) show that the socio-economic impact of the crisis has disproportionately affected women and girls. According to the ILO, 580,000 women were estimated to have lost their employment within the first six months of 2021., To address this unprecedented situation, humanitarian actors in Myanmar have prepared a Humanitarian Response Plan for 2022, requesting US$826 million to reach 6.2 million people in need of life-saving humanitarian support. Fifty two (52) per cent of the people targeted are women. The Plan remains desperately underfunded (see cluster section for sectoral breakdowns of funding gaps)., Annually, 8 March marks International Women’s Day and is a global opportunity to celebrate women achievements, raise awareness on women’s equality, and lobby for accelerated gender parity. This year’s theme was “gender equal today for a sustainable tomorrow”. The United Nations in Myanmar issued a statement on this day reiterating “its commitment to put women and girls at the centre of its development and humanitarian response to the ongoing crises in the country, to ensure that their needs are met, and to support their role and agency in shaping a future path for their country.” To achieve this, humanitarian actors need the urgent financial support of donor member states to save the lives and future of millions of women and girls in Myanmar.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-update-no-16-19-march-2022
Myanmar: UN Rights Body Should Advance Justice,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,18 Mar 2022,"Support Arms Embargo, Stronger Targeted Sanctions, (Geneva) -- The United Nations Human Rights Council should adopt a strategy for accountability in Myanmar to end abuses by the military junta, Human Rights Watch said today. The council will discuss Myanmar and the new report by the UN Human Rights Office at its meeting on March 21, 2022., The Human Rights Council resolution should call for all UN member states to prevent the flow of weapons into Myanmar and impose stronger, targeted economic sanctions against individuals implicated in abuses and military interests. The resolution should also urge the UN Security Council to refer Myanmar to the International Criminal Court., ""The UN Human Rights Council should respond to Myanmar's human rights and humanitarian crisis with urgency and purpose,"" said Lucy McKernan, deputy UN advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. ""The rights council should take strong action against security forces that have never faced consequences for their numerous crimes."", Since the February 1, 2021, coup, Myanmar's junta has carried out a brutal nationwide crackdown to suppress those opposing military rule. The junta's systematic and pervasive abuses, including mass killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and indiscriminate attacks on civilians, amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes., The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned Myanmar security forces' violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in a March 15 report, stating:, The military and security forces have shown a flagrant disregard for human life, bombarding populated areas with airstrikes and heavy weapons and deliberately targeting civilians, many of whom have been shot in the head, burned to death, arbitrarily arrested, tortured or used as human shields., In recent weeks, there have been increasing reports of Myanmar military airstrikes and use of heavy weapons causing civilian loss of life and property. The UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, in his February report on government sales of weapons to the Myanmar military, said that jet aircraft, attack helicopters, armored vehicles, light and heavy artillery, missiles, and rockets are being used against civilians. More than 400 of the attacks reported occurred in Sagaing Region in northwestern Myanmar, where most civilian fatalities have recently occurred., The Human Rights Council, in addition to calling on all UN member countries to prevent the transfer of weapons to Myanmar, should also call for all revenues from oil, gas, timber, and gems that flow to the military and help finance the abuses to be put into an escrow account for the Myanmar people until a democratically elected civilian government is restored., Since the coup, security forces have killed at least 1,600 people and detained more than 12,000, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. Over 500,000 people have been internally displaced since the coup, while tens of thousands have fled as refugees to Thailand and India, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR., In many parts of the country, the junta is deliberately blocking aid to populations as a form of collective punishment. The UN estimates that the number of people needing assistance has grown from 1 million before the coup to 14.4 million, including more than 5 million children. About 25 million people, or half the population, are estimated to be below the national poverty line., Internet shutdowns remain in parts of the country after the junta imposed rolling nationwide shutdowns and blocked access to social media following the coup. Under international human rights standards, internet-based restrictions must be necessary and proportionate. Blanket internet shutdowns are a form of collective punishment that hinder access to information and communications needed for daily life, which is particularly vital during times of crisis., ""Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and other junta leaders have been able to brutally quash protests and dissent with minimal international interference,"" McKernan said. ""The Human Rights Council should urgently push back against these abuses and lead the international response to protect rights and advance accountability in Myanmar.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-un-rights-body-should-advance-justice

Agenda item 4 Human rights situations that require the Council’s attention, Summary, Thirteen months after launching a coup against the government, an illegal military junta has waged a relentless war against the people of Myanmar and their fundamental rights. The results have been devastating. Junta forces have killed at least 1,600 civilians and displaced over 500,000. Half of the population has fallen into poverty. The World Health Organization is now projecting that there will be over 47,000 preventable deaths in Myanmar this year. Thirteen million people face food insecurity., This report highlights some of the most serious human rights violations in Myanmar during the period September 2021 through February 2022. It documents the military’s violent attacks on civilian populations, including airstrikes, mortaring, arson, extrajudicial killings, and the use of forced labor and human shields. The report describes the junta’s campaign to arrest and imprison activists, journalists, peaceful protesters and other opponents. It documents the junta’s criminalization of fundamental rights such as freedom of speech and assembly. It also shares the experiences of those who have faced torture and other illtreatment during periods of detention. Many of these attacks constitute probable crimes against humanity and/or war crimes, and perpetrators must be brought to justice., The report describes the efforts of the people of Myanmar to oppose the military junta and defend their nation. Led by large numbers of young people, including many young women, protest organizers have demonstrated great skill, tenacity and creativity in the mobilization of opposition despite the near constant threat of imprisonment or death. The Special Rapporteur is inspired by their conviction and tireless efforts., To succeed, the people of Myanmar need a much stronger level of support from the international community. The report concludes with specific recommendations that he urges UN Security Council and Member States to take., I. Introduction, More than 13 months after overthrowing a democratically elected government, the Myanmar junta has intensified its war against the people of Myanmar. The military has escalated its indiscriminate attacks against civilians using jet fighters, attack helicopters and heavy artillery, and soldiers have burned entire villages to the ground. Civilians and combatants have been tortured, raped, executed and used as human shields., The scale of these atrocities is immense. According to conservative estimates, at least 1,600 civilians have been killed by the junta’s forces. Nearly 10,000 people are currently detained because of their opposition to military rule, and the junta has amended the legal code to further criminalize the exercise of fundamental rights including the rights to freedom of expression and assembly. More than 500,000 people have been displaced since the coup bringing the current number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Myanmar to over 800,000. Tens of thousands who have sought safety in Bangladesh, India and Thailand have joined the approximately one million refugees from Myanmar in neighboring countries., Many of the junta’s human rights violations constitute probable crimes against humanity and war crimes. Those responsible must be held to account., This report highlights some of the most serious human rights concerns in Myanmar during the period September 2021 through February 2022. It documents the military’s violent attacks on civilian populations, including airstrikes, mortaring, arson, extrajudicial killings, and the use of forced labor and human shields. These attacks have created and exacerbated the dire humanitarian crisis that now grips the country, threatening the livelihoods, health and lives of millions. The report describes the junta’s campaign to arrest and imprison thousands of activists, journalists, peaceful protesters and other opponents. It also shares the experiences of those who have faced torture and other ill-treatment during periods of detention. The Special Rapporteur describes the particular dangers and human rights challenges faced by women and children and outlines the junta’s efforts to criminalize and otherwise suppress fundamental rights and freedoms. This report also describes the dire human rights situation for Rohingya populations in Rakhine State, including those who are confined to IDP camps., In December 2021, the Special Rapporteur traveled to Bangladesh, as part of his overall assessment of the human rights situation of the Rohingya people of Myanmar. In an annex to this report, the Special Rapporteur reflects on his trip, noting the role that the people and government of Bangladesh played in saving untold numbers of Rohingya as they fled the genocidal attacks of the Myanmar military in Rakhine State. He makes recommendations with respect to the protection of and support to Rohingya in the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar and on Bhasan Char island., The report follows the publication in February 2022 of the Special Rapporteur’s conference paper on arms sales to the Myanmar military (A/HRC/49/CRP.1). It underscores concerns raised in the paper, namely that several nations continue to sell or authorize the transfer of weapons of war to the Myanmar military, despite knowledge that the weapons are almost certain to be used in attacks against civilians. These transfers violate international law., Many people in Myanmar—including the victims of human rights abuses and their family members, some of whom are highlighted in this report—have told the Special Rapporteur that they are profoundly disappointed with the failure of the international community to act decisively to help prevent atrocities and hold perpetrators accountable. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his call to the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution imposing an arms embargo and targeted economic sanctions against the Myanmar military and referring the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court. He elaborates steps that Member States should take in the absence of Security Council action. The Special Rapporteur notes the strong and swift action taken by Member States on behalf of the people of Ukraine and implores the international community to act similarly to protect the people of Myanmar. They too are under siege by a brutal and relentless military attack., The Special Rapporteur reiterates his deep admiration for the courage and resilience of the Myanmar people. He has been inspired by the bravery of survivors of human rights violations who have taken great personal risks to speak with him, by the resourcefulness of activists who have found new and creative ways to challenge military rule, and by the resilience of communities that have repeatedly rebounded from attacks over many months, years or decades. The Special Rapporteur is honored to share their stories, and their words, in this report. He is also grateful to the non-governmental and civil society organizations, human rights defenders, local human rights groups, Member States and United Nations programs and agencies that contributed to this report., II.

Myanmar: MPs demand ASEAN action in response to damning UN report,News and Press Release,APHR,Protection and Human Rights,16 Mar 2022,"JAKARTA – Southeast Asian parliamentarians have called on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to take urgent and immediate steps to alleviate the suffering of Myanmar’s people in response to a report the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) submitted to the Human Rights Council this week. The report found that the military has engaged in “systematic and widespread human rights violations and abuses”, some of which may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity., “We’re soon approaching one year since ASEAN agreed on the Five Point Consensus, a year in which the bloc’s disastrous failure to make progress on these points has effectively given the Myanmar military license to commit what this UN report has concluded may amount to the gravest crimes against humanity,” said Charles Santiago, chair of ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR) and a Malaysian Member of Parliament (MP). “Security forces have shown a flagrant disregard for human life, using air raids and heavy weapons on populated areas, deliberately targeting civilians.”, “Meanwhile, the current ASEAN Chair, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, has attempted to engage with the criminal junta of Min Aung Hlaing unilaterally, undermining and delaying any meaningful steps ASEAN might have taken to save lives. ASEAN is politically and morally responsible for addressing this catastrophic situation in Myanmar, directly caused by the military junta,” Santiago said. In addition to accusing the military’s State Administration Council (SAC) of manipulating the “legal framework to facilitate military rule”, it said the military’s seizure of power has left the country facing “violence on a massive scale”, including arbitrary detentions, unnecessary and disproportionate use of force against peaceful protesters, extrajudicial killings and ill-treatment and torture in custody., The report was published on the same day that Hun Manith, the son of ASEAN Chair Hun Sen, welcomed a Myanmar military delegation to Phnom Penh for the 19th ASEAN Military Intelligence Meeting. APHR condemns this meeting as a potential legitimization of the junta, whose crimes against the people continue to mount., It is little wonder that the report specifically named ASEAN for failing to achieve tangible results, APHR added. The other ASEAN members must push Cambodia, as the current chair, for concrete actions to address the crisis. The OHCHR report further supports the clear and urgent need for the regional bloc to respond, or risk increased damage to its already weakening credibility., ASEAN, and specifically its Chair, must immediately discontinue inviting any other junta representatives to all ASEAN official meetings until there is an end to violence, all political prisoners are freed, and the will of the people for fully-fledged democracy has been heard, APHR said., ASEAN must also begin a dialogue with the National Unity Government in accordance with its own consensus and, as the UN OHCHR report puts it, for the “international community (to) do everything within its power to support the people of Myanmar and turn this human rights catastrophe into an opportunity”., “It is shocking that more than 14 million people in Myanmar, a fifth of the population, are in need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, and yet ASEAN has still only provided aid to support the COVID-19 response. The Five-Point Consensus plan to provide aid through the ASEAN Humanitarian Assistance Center was doomed to fail from the start, but it is not too late to act. ASEAN should now focus its collective political will to help people in need and support local non-state actors and networks that the people already trust to distribute aid,” Santiago said.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-mps-demand-asean-action-response-damning-un-report

Following oral presentations to the Human Rights Council on the findings and implementation of the recommendations of Mr. Rosenthal’s review in 2020 and 2021, Human Rights Council resolution 46/21 (March 2021) invited the Secretary-General to provide a written report on progress made in the implementation of follow-up action to enable more effective work in the future and to strengthen the prevention capacity of the United Nations system., **I. Introduction **, In resolution 73/264 on the “Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar”, the UN General Assembly noted “the recommendation by the fact-finding mission on the conduct of a comprehensive, independent inquiry into the involvement of the United Nations in Myanmar since 2011 and encourage[d] the United Nations system to follow up on the issues raised and to ensure that all engagement with Myanmar takes into account, and addresses, human rights concerns.”1 Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 73/264 of 22 December 2018,2 and to resolution 39/2 Adopted by the Human Rights Council,3 the Secretary-General appointed Mr. Gert Rosenthal in December 2018 to conduct an independent inquiry into the involvement of the United Nations in Myanmar from 2010 to 2018., Mr. Rosenthal’s observations can be categorised as three sets of interrelated areas and challenges to be addressed: (i) UN structures, coordination, information sharing and decisionmaking;, (ii) interaction with the host government; (iii) interaction with other Member States (both within UN bodies and bilaterally) and the wider international community, including international NGOs., Following oral presentations to the Human Rights Council on the findings and implementation of the recommendations of Mr. Rosenthal’s review in 2020 and 2021, Human Rights Council resolution 46/214 (March 2021) invited the Secretary-General to provide a written report on progress made in the implementation of follow-up action to enable more effective work in the future and to strengthen the prevention capacity of the United Nations system., Since Mr. Rosenthal’s review, the Secretary-General launched his Call to Action for Human Rights (Call to Action), which promotes a transformative vision of human rights across the United Nations system, recognising human rights as offering solutions and tools, and as speaking to the aspirations of every human being. The initiative underlines that “human rights are the responsibility of each and every United Nations actor and that a culture of human rights must permeate everything we do, in the field, at regional level and at Headquarters”.5 It also makes clear the link between human rights protection and prevention. The present report should be read in conjunction with efforts underway in the context of the Call to Action, as well as Our Common Agenda,6 launched by the Secretary-General in September 2021. Our Common Agenda contains recommendations across four broad areas, including a new social contract anchored in human rights., Together, the Call to Action and Our Common Agenda provide the UN system with the necessary frameworks, coherence, and momentum, to ensure that human rights is placed at the centre of our efforts across the three pillars, as envisaged in Mr. Rosenthal’s review.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/brief-and-independent-inquiry-involvement-united-nations-myanmar-2010-2018-report

"Myanmar: UN report urges immediate, concerted effort by international community to stem violence, hold military accountable",News and Press Release,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,15 Mar 2022,"GENEVA (15 March 2022) -- The international community must take concerted, immediate measures to stem the spiral of violence in Myanmar, where the military has engaged in systematic and widespread human rights violations and abuses -- some of which may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said in a new report today., The report,* released for the 49th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council, said Myanmar's military and security forces have shown a flagrant disregard for human life, bombarding populated areas with airstrikes and heavy weapons and deliberately targeting civilians, many of whom have been shot in the head, burned to death, arbitrarily arrested, tortured or used as human shields., Citing the determination of Myanmar's people in their opposition to the coup, Bachelet called on the international community to do all it can to resolve the crisis and hold perpetrators of gross violations of international human rights law accountable., ""Throughout the tumult and violence of the past year, the will of the people has clearly not been broken. They remain committed to seeing a return to democracy and to institutions that reflect their will and aspirations,"" Bachelet said., Covering the period since the 1 February 2021 military takeover, the report is based on interviews with over 155 victims, witnesses, and advocates, whose accounts were corroborated with satellite imagery, verified multimedia files, and credible open-source information. Its findings, however, represent only a fraction of the violations and abuses Myanmar's people have been subjected to since the coup., At least 1,600 people have been killed by security forces and their affiliates and more than 12,500 people have been detained. At least 440,000 others have been displaced and 14 million are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, the delivery of which has largely been blocked by the military in new and pre-existing areas of need., The report concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe the military, the Tatmadaw, had engaged in violence and abuse as part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against civilians -- patterns of conduct that may amount to crimes against humanity., Mass killings have taken place. In July in Sagaing Region, soldiers killed 40 individuals in a series of raids; villagers found the remains of some victims with their hands and feet still tied behind their backs. In December in Kayah State, soldiers burned the bodies of up to 40 men, women and children; villagers described discovering the remains in several trucks, with bodies found in positions indicating they had tried to escape and were burnt alive., Detainees reported facing torture and other forms of ill-treatment during lengthy interrogations in military detention centres across Myanmar. This reportedly included suspension from the ceiling without food or water; being forced to stand for extended periods while in solitary confinement; electrocution, sometimes alongside injection of unidentified drugs; sexual violence, including rape; and forcing Muslim detainees to ingest pork., While most of the gross human rights violations documented were carried out by security forces, at least 543 individuals -- including local administrators, their families and alleged informants -- were also reportedly killed due to their perceived support of the military. Anti-coup armed elements claimed responsibility for 95 of the incidents., ""Meaningful action by the international community is urgently needed to stop yet more individuals from being stripped of their rights, their lives and their livelihoods,"" Bachelet said., ""The appalling breadth and scale of violations of international law suffered by the people of Myanmar demand a firm, unified, and resolute international response."", ENDS, For more information and media requests, please contact:, In Geneva

Annual report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and reports of the Office of the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General
Human rights situations that require the Council’s attention, Introduction and methodology, In resolution 46/21, the Human Rights Council requested, inter alia, the High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide a comprehensive report on the overall human rights situation in Myanmar at its 49th session, with a particular focus on accountability regarding alleged violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, rule of law and security sector reform since 1 February 2021, as well as on implementation of recommendations on the human rights situation of Rohingya Muslims and other minorities., The present report covers human rights concerns documented by OHCHR since 1 February 2021. It analyses the most egregious violations committed by the Myanmar military (Tatmadaw), highlighting trends and patterns over a year of martial rule, and coming to preliminary conclusions as to violations of international human rights, humanitarian and criminal law., This report relies upon primary and secondary source material collected and subjected to credibility assessments. Without access to Myanmar, OHCHR applied consistent methodology of information-gathering, including remote interviews and meetings with over 155 victims, victims’ advocates, and witnesses of human rights violations. First-hand information was corroborated with satellite imagery, verified multimedia files, and credible open-source information. Factual determinations of cases, incidents, and patterns were made where there were reasonable grounds to believe that incidents had occurred as described. Given the serious security risks that individuals in Myanmar have been exposed to since 1 February, OHCHR has prioritized the safety of victims, witnesses, and interlocutors above other considerations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/situation-human-rights-myanmar-1-february-2021-report-un-high-commissioner-human

Shelter and Non-Food Items",28 Feb 2022,"In the first week of February, the total number of IDPs have continued to slightly decrease compared to previous weeks with a total of 224,100 people displaced. Several factors explain such decrease including, in Kayin State, 9505 IDPs returned from the Thai-Myanmar border to their places of origin in Myawaddy township after the withdraw of the Tatmadaw from their villages, few returns also occurred in Thayetchaung township, Tanintharyi region and temporary returns of IDPs living in collective sites in Shan south also took place towards less conflictive areas in Loikaw. In some cases, IDPs moved back to verify the situation and see the possibility to return permanently. On the other hand, a smaller number of new IDPs was reported this week. However, for the first time since the beginning of the year, 410 new IDPs have been verified in Mon State, indicating an increase of the conflict in this area., In the second week, the total number of IDPs has risen to 226,400. In Shan State (South), 2,350 Kayah IDPs who have been displaced since January, were verified. A small number of about 100 individuals returned to less conflict-affected parts of Loikaw. Some Kayah IDPs also went to their villages and houses to verify the situation there and collect personal belongings before returning to Shan State (South). Within Kayah State, temporary returns to villages of origin continued to take place but IDP returnees were often forced toflee again due to insecurity. This was the case in Kone Thar village in Loikaw Township where 200 IDPs who moved back a few weeks ago were displaced again into the jungle after heavy clashes. In Tanintharyi Region, armed clashes occurred in Palaw Township. So far, 100 new IDPs were verified., During the third week, the total number of IDPs slightly decreased to 224.200. New displacements occurred but also returns to the villages of origin. The continuous fighting in Demoso and Pekon townships resulted in the displacement of 2883 new IDPs to Hsihseng, Lawksawk, Pekon, Pinlaung townships in Shan south and also 493 new IDPs displaced towards Demoso township in Kayah State. Also, 1296 IDPs from Myawaddy township were displaced to the river sides due to the intensified clashes and airstrikes. In parallel, 4738 IDPs from southern part of Kawkareik Township who have been displaced in January 2022, returned to their villages in other parts of Kawkareik township after the withdrawal of Tatmadaw troops. In addition, 2269 IDPs have returned from Shan South to Loikaw Town.
During the last week of February, the number of IDPs started to increase again and 6,748 new IDPs were veried. In Shan South 3,801 new IDPs were reported and 1,442 new IDPs in Kayah reportedly due to 8 day-ghting in Pekon and Demoso townships. In addition, 55 IDPs in Demoso Township were displaced again within it, due to reportedly indiscriminate bombings closed to their camp. In Kayin state, 500 individuals were displaced from Hpapun Township to Hlaingbwe township, after several airstrikes and clashes reported in the area. In Tanintharyi, the situation continues to deteriorate, and several clashes were reported between the MAF and the PDFs resulting in about 950 new IDPs but 50 of them managed to return to their villages of origin after 2 days",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-south-east-monthly-displacement-snapshot-trend-people-displaced-south-east-5
"A Year On, No Justice for Myanmar Massacre",News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,14 Mar 2022,"Military Crackdown in Hlaing Tharyar Continues, Manny Maung
Myanmar Researcher, Asia Division, On March 14, 2021, “Zarni” joined protests in Hlaing Tharyar, near Yangon, against the Myanmar military’s February 1 coup. The large protests were planned by factory workers, a large portion of the industrial area’s residents., Protesters prepared barricades to ward off security forces, who had been cracking down on peaceful protests around the country., But there were no arrests that day, Zarni said. “They just shot to kill.”, Human Rights Watch documented that police and soldiers with assault rifles deliberately surrounded – or “kettled” – the Hlaing Tharyar protesters, killing at least 65 people. The security forces, witnesses said, emerged from different directions to trap them., The shootings in Hlaing Tharyar stand out as one of the deadliest days since the coup, not least because of the apparent premeditated use of lethal force., A year later, Zarni says Hlaing Tharyar is still not safe. “We have been under martial law since then. So long as the military exists, we continue suffering.”, The challenges of documenting human rights abuses in an increasingly closed country make exact tallies of people killed difficult. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners has reported that 1,600 protesters and bystanders have died since the coup. The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED) project suggests a far higher number of total deaths. The United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, estimates 837,000 people are displaced within Myanmar, over 500,000 since the coup., In October, the authorities forcibly evicted and destroyed informal settlements in Hlaing Tharyar, leaving at least 8,000 families homeless. Night raids and arbitrary arrests have continued, while closed military courts handed down death sentences. Unemployment and food insecurity have also increased in Myanmar, and the UN Development Program predicts urban poverty rates will triple in 2022., The UN Human Rights Council will discuss the situation in Myanmar on March 18. The council should call on the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution referring the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court and recommend to the UN secretary-general to further assist international mechanisms investigating abuses. It should also call for all revenues from oil, gas, timber, and gems that flow to the military and fuel abuses to be put into an escrow account in the name of the Myanmar people until a democratically elected civilian government is restored., Failure to take strong steps in Myanmar emboldens the military to commit further abuses and unnecessarily prolongs the suffering of people throughout the country.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/year-no-justice-myanmar-massacre
Myanmar: Living with the rising risk of landmines and other explosive devices,News and Press Release,ICRC,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",11 Mar 2022,"In Myanmar, landmines and other explosive remnants of war shatter lives. Hundreds of people are killed or injured every year. Last year, we supported 160 people affected by incidents involving landmines and other explosive ordinances. With Myanmar in ongoing crisis, the risks continue to rise. Even after the fighting, explosive remnants of war remain -- continuing to endanger lives., U Maung Thein Htay from Rakhine State's Ann Township is one of the many civilians whose life was disrupted by a landmine injury. Early in 2021, he was on his way to gather raw material to make traditional handmade hats and fans. He wasn't far from the highway when he stepped on something and heard a deafening blast., ""The place was covered with leaves, so I didn't spot anything out of ordinary on the ground. Also, I had never seen explosive devices in my life to be able to identify them,"" he said. U Maung Thein Htay was rushed to Kan Htaung Gyi Hospital in Myaebon Township and was later transferred to Sittwe General Hospital for further treatment. That's where the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) team first met him while assessing the best form of support that could be given to victims of landmine accidents., ""I was devastated at losing my leg and I worried that I wouldn't be able to make enough money to feed my family,"" U Maung Thein Htay said. As a father of three children and the breadwinner of the family, he felt depressed sitting at home all day, relying entirely on his wife and children to even get about the house for his own needs., In October 2021, U Maung Thein Htay arrived at the ICRC's Sittwe physical rehabilitation workshop to get new prosthesis fitted and undergo physiotherapy. ''Now that I've got my prosthetic leg, I feel like my old self again. It feels like I lost my leg, then got it back. I'll be able to work again and provide for my family,"" he said with a smile. Thinking of the future, U Maung Thein Htay said he would like to open a small grocery store at his home in Ann Township. ""I hope it will cover some of the daily expenses of my family,"" he added., To strengthen rehabilitation services in Rakhine State, the ICRC partners with The Leprosy Mission Myanmar (TLMM) and provides mobile prosthetic-orthotic services particularly to those living with physical disabilities, the elderly, pregnant women and children in communities displaced by armed conflict. These services include counselling, medical referrals and support for those in need of prosthesis, mobility aids and wheelchairs.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-living-rising-risk-landmines-and-other-explosive-devices

The refugees on board were overwhelmingly women and girls, which is consistent with overall trends. One 17-year old girl died during the three weeks the boat spent at sea in dangerous conditions. Survivors reported that smugglers physically abused them and then abandoned them adrift at sea. In addition, in June 2021, 81 Rohingya refugees disembarked in Aceh after a grueling four-month journey at sea., TREATMENT OF PERSONS RESCUED AT SEA, On both occasions of disembarkation in Aceh, authorities and humanitarian actors immediately mobilized to address the medical and other needs of the rescued persons. Health screening for COVID-19, quarantine measures and vaccinations were implemented. In addition, UNHCR and protection partners deployed experts to identify survivors with specific needs and provide specialized services. Vulnerable people include potential victims of trafficking, unaccompanied and separated children, and survivors of sexual and genderbased violence., NEED FOR RESPONSIBILITY-SHARING, The local community in Aceh has maintained solidarity and compassion towards those in need, with Acehnese fishermen continuing to rescue those in distress at sea. In 2021, Indonesia and Bangladesh disembarked the majority of vulnerable refugees in distress at sea (those that disembarked in Myanmar were intercepted by authorities as they attempted to leave.)

"Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar - Bulletin Issue 6, March 2022 [EN/MY]",Situation Report,UN HRC,Protection and Human Rights,7 Mar 2022,"Message from the Head of the Mechanism, Since the elected government of Myanmar was deposed by military authorities over a year ago, we have received reports that suggest that more than a thousand individuals have been killed and many thousands detained in circumstances related to the coup. Information collected by the Mechanism strongly suggests that crimes against humanity and war crimes may have been committed, including the crimes of arbitrary detention, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, murder, attacks intentionally directed against the civilian population or against individual civilians not taking direct part in hostilities, and deportation or forcible transfer of the population., The Mechanism is working independently and impartially to investigate the facts underlying the reports it receives, and according to the high standards of a professional and objective criminal investigation. Where there is clear and convincing evidence of the commission of crimes, the Mechanism will prepare files to facilitate criminal trials of the persons responsible. The Mechanism has been able to gather a great deal of relevant material and we are adding information and evidence to our files almost daily. While closely following events since the coup and collecting relevant information, the Mechanism continues its work on other events within its mandate that have taken place in the territory of Myanmar since 2011, including those related to crimes against the Rohingya people., The Mechanism is very grateful to the many thousands of persons and organizations that have shared evidence relevant to our investigations of serious international crimes in Myanmar. We are committed to doing all we can to assure the safety and security of those with whom we interact and will make every effort to build strong cases so that their brave contributions to justice in Myanmar are not made in vain., The Mechanism is using all possible strategies and innovations to gather and verify evidence that can facilitate prosecutions in national, regional and international courts. We have been sharing evidence with the Parties in The Gambia v. Myanmar at the International Court of Justice, which recently concluded a round of public hearings on the case. We are also cooperating with the International Criminal Court, and look forward to sharing files with other courts that have or may in the future have jurisdiction over these crimes., However, in order to gather more relevant information and evidence, the cooperation of States where the evidence and witnesses are located, especially in the Asia region, is essential. The Mechanism is grateful to the many States which are already cooperating and looks forward to deepening and expanding such cooperation in order to hold the perpetrators of the most serious international crimes in Myanmar to account., I wish to express my sincere gratitude to all those who have helped the Mechanism in its efforts to collect and verify evidence, including victim and survivor groups, civil society organizations, businesses and many brave individuals. We will continue to do all we can to collect evidence of the most serious international crimes so that one day, there will be justice for victims from Myanmar and all will know that impunity for such crimes will no longer be tolerated., - Nicholas Koumjian",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/independent-investigative-mechanism-myanmar-bulletin-issue-6-march-2022-enmy

The survey conducted in December 2021 found that one-third of women are afraid of walking in their neighbourhoods, even during the day., This is a sharp departure from what women in Myanmar said in 2019, when only 3.5 percent of women reported feeling unsafe during the daytime, in their communities. Half of the women surveyed said they do not feel safe outside their neighbourhoods, and a full third reported feeling unsafe in their own homes, at night., ""The survey sends a clear and chilling message that the fear of violence is preventing the women of Myanmar from living a normal life. This must be addressed right away,"" said Kanni Wignaraja, UNDP's Director for the Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific. The pandemic and heightened insecurity from the military takeover has gravely impacted women's finances and health.

This will have a direct adverse effect on future generations and on the overall prosperity of Myanmar."", The survey also paints a bleak view on the economic front.

With shrinking household incomes, women report skipping meals, taking out loans, and selling off anything valuable to make ends meet., This drastic fall in economic prosperity for women must immediately be halted and the wider health and welfare of women in Myanmar must be prioritized for the country to rebound following COVID-19., ""The women of Myanmar have played a key role in the development of their country,"" said Sarah Knibbs, Officer-in-Charge for UN Women Asia and the Pacific. ""Women drove the response to Cyclone Nargis in 2008 and the transition to democracy after 2012.

Protection and Human Rights",8 Mar 2022,"MYANMAR, The security and humanitarian situation across Shan State remained fragile during the reporting period, with armed clashes reported between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and various Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs), as well as among EAOs in Hopang, Kutkai, Lashio and Muse townships in the state’s north and in Lawksawk, Leihka, Loilen and Mawkmai townships in the state’s south since February 2022. As a result, 2,126 people have been newly displaced in seven townships since 1 February 2022. At the same time, a total of 2,474 IDPs, who were hosted in six townships were also able to return to their places of origin within Shan State during February. Humanitarian access to conflict areas remains limited due to insecurity and ongoing fighting; however, humanitarian partners, in collaboration with local responders and religious leaders, have managed to provide critical life-saving assistance and protection services to people in need. According to UNHCR, as of 28 February, 14,320 people out of the 56,400 people, who were internally displaced across 19 townships in Shan State since the beginning of 2021, remain displaced in 11 townships., Nationwide, a total of 873,000 people remain displaced in Myanmar, of whom 502,600 were displaced since the military takeover in February 2021., 873,000 people displaced nationwide, AFGHANISTAN, Two-thirds of the population of Afghanistan are now resorting to crisis-level coping strategies to feed their families. This is an eight percentage point increase from December and a sixfold increase since August 2021, according to WFP’s latest Food Security Update for Afghanistan., Almost 100 percent of female-headed households are facing insufficient food consumption. Eight in ten households experienced a significant decrease in income during the month of January., Households in Kabul were hit the hardest, where some families braved the harsh winter season without any income at all., 22.8 million people – half of the population – are projected to be acutely food insecure in 2022, including 8.7 million at risk of famine-like conditions, with all 34 provinces are facing crisis or emergency levels of acute food insecurity., INDONESIA, Following several days of torrential rain, floods struck Pandeglang District, Serang District, Serang City, and Cilegon City of Banten on 1-6 March 2022. At its peak on 4 March, floodwaters inundated 4,495 houses and directly affected over 10,000 people. In Serang City, six people died after they were swept away or electrocuted. As of 7 March, floodwaters have largely receded although potential heavy rains continue. Floods and landslides in Manado City of North Sulawesi on 3 March killed two people and at least 155 households were affected.

Protection and Human Rights
Water Sanitation Hygiene",8 Mar 2022,"On International Women’s Day, the UN in Myanmar reaffirms its solidarity and commitment to the women and girls across Myanmar., As we mark the occasion of International Women’s Day, the United Nations in Myanmar reiterates its commitment to put women and girls at the centre of its development and humanitarian work in response to the ongoing crises in the country, to ensure that their needs are met, and to support their role and agency in shaping a future path for their country., The theme for 2022 is “gender equal today for a sustainable tomorrow”, recognizing that gender equality and women's rights are fundamental to global progress on peace and security, human rights, and sustainable development. Throughout history, the women of Myanmar have played a key role in the development of their country. In the past two years, they have both assumed a leading role in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and been at the forefront calling for a return to democracy and respect of human rights while being disproportionally affected by the compounded crises that the country is going through., According to the latest humanitarian update from the United Nations in Myanmar, as of 28 February 873,000 people are displaced in Myanmar, including 502,600 people who have fled their homes since 1 February 2021 and 370,400 people from previous conflicts. The majority of IDPs are women and girls. Both the World Bank and International Labour Organization analyses show that the socio-economic impact of the crisis has disproportionally affected women and girls. According to the ILO, 580,000 women were estimated to have lost their employment in just the first six months of 2021., A recent Study by the UN Development Programme and UN Women reveals that women are bearing the brunt of the impact of COVID-19 and the military takeover with its unprecedented impact on the economy. Women have adopted drastic coping mechanisms to deal with falling incomes and nearly half of women report a significant increase in their unpaid care and domestic work, reducing their chances to earn a livelihood. Women are also reporting increased difficulty in reaching services including maternal health services., To address this reality, the members of the United Nations Country Team have worked tirelessly with local women civil society organizations and their partners to prioritize the need of women and girls in their response to the crises., In 2021, the United Nations delivered sexual and reproductive health services for 46,158 women and gender-based violence services for 28,611 women across the country and supported 6,502 maternal emergency referrals, helping women in hard-to-reach and conflict-affected areas to receive essential health care. The UN also delivered food and nutrition assistance including school feeding and resilience building support for about 1.5 million women and girls across the country, reached more than a quarter of a million women and girls with critical water, sanitation and hygiene supplies and provided more than 120,000 conflict-affected women and girls with access to safe water. Together with partners, over 14,000 girls and 3,500 women were also provided with mental health and psychosocial support services, delivered in communities and through child-friendly spaces., With support from donors, the UN has provided the equivalent of 1.7 million USD in cash transfers to 39,042 vulnerable garment workers, overwhelmingly women. Financial inclusion partners also provided loans totaling more than 498 million USD to 2.4 million clients, 91 per cent of whom were women, in the first half of 2021. In additional 5.2 million USD in loans were disbursed to more than 257,000, 93 per cent women, in conflicted-affected areas., On International Women’s Day, the UN in Myanmar reaffirms its solidarity with women and girls, and its commitment to stand by their side as they forge the future of their country. We also echo the words of the UN Secretary-General in recognizing the contribution of women and girls, their ideas, innovations, and activism that are changing our world for the better, and their leadership across all walks of life. Without gender equality today, a sustainable future, and an equal future, remains beyond our reach.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/statement-united-nations-myanmar-international-womens-day-2022

""They had survived."", In her role working for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) from Maungdaw in Myanmar's Rakhine State, Naing Naing was one of many who helped the children following the incident., ""Now, when they see me, they recognise me,"" she says. ""I cannot forget this thing."" Naing Naing works as part of a team in Maungdaw that provides a range of support for families separated by violence., A parent who needs financial help to visit a son or daughter in prison. A person recently released from a police lockup who needs assistance making the long journey home. Families looking for lost loved ones after a clash., These are just some examples of cases where Naing Naing and her colleagues seek to provide support. It is work that is collaborative and unceasing. Naing Naing has been with the team since 2017, joining just as outbreaks of violence resulted in waves of displacement impacting hundreds of thousands of people in Rakhine., At that time, colleagues from across Myanmar were called in to help respond to the massive spike in humanitarian needs. Years later, working as part of a close-knit team remains a highlight for Naing Naing.　　, ""The first thing I think of is the working environment, which is amazing,"" she says. ""I have lots of support from my colleagues."", Beyond the team, it is also the ability to work directly with people in northern Rakhine that is most rewarding. ""I can work with communities – I can talk with and learn from them,"" Naing Naing says., ""I feel great working for the ICRC because we are an organisation that doesn't take sides – I feel really comfortable explaining who we are to villagers, to other people, to my family."", The ICRC has worked in Maungdaw, not far from the border with Bangladesh, since 2015., Activities range from emergency assistance – like food and health services – to helping communities build sustainable livelihoods, often together with partners such as the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS)., ""Here, lots of people know about the ICRC because of our food distributions,"" Naing Naing says. ""People also know our support in reconnecting families well."", The communities surrounding Maungdaw, and neighbouring Buthidaung, are multilingual and multifaith. Naing Naing grew up here, with neighbours and classmates reflecting this diversity.　　, Her familiarity with Maungdaw, and the communities' familiarity with the ICRC, helps with the work., ""I can explain our organisation is a humanitarian organisation,"" she says. ""I explain we don't take sides; we don't discriminate based on belief or colour of skin – but they already know this from our activity."", In 2022, the dual impacts of COVID-19 and the 2021 military intervention still overlay the legacies of ongoing conflicts across the country to make life more challenging for people in Myanmar., Despite the obstacles these overlapping impacts also pose for humanitarian work, the numbers tell a story of hope. Across Myanmar in 2021, we were able to help more than 4000 recently released detainees return home. We helped families visit loved ones behind bars more than 200 times and delivered close to 250 written messages., For Naing Naing, helping people feel comfortable enough to share their stories and needs is key to this work., ""It depends on the person – I don't ask hard questions, I ask 'how are you?'"" she says.

These include 230,800 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in South-East Myanmar – 93,800 in Kayah State, 56,300 in Shan State (South-all towns except Kyethi, Laihka and Mongkaing), 68,900 in Kayin State, 7,500 in Mon State, 3,500 in Tanintharyi Region and 800 in Bago Region and 6,600 in Shan State (North). In addition, there are 171,000 IDPs in Sagaing Region, 42,300 in Magway Region and 33,200 in Chin State., In the South-East, return movements of internally displaced persons to their areas of origin continue to be reported from Shan State (South) to Kayah State. IDPs have been obliged to return due to the lack of shelter, food, water and winter items in displacement areas. Given the ongoing armed conflict, it is anticipated that returnees might be displaced again. Conflict has intensified in Demoso and Loikaw townships, Kayah State, resulting in civilian casualties and reportedly some 100 properties set on fire. Access and movement restrictions are limiting UNHCR and its partners’ ability to respond to the dire needs of displaced populations, especially for food and healthcare., In the North-East, armed clashes have displaced some 1,000 people in Mamauk Township, Kachin State., In the North-West, the security situation remains volatile due to an escalation of armed conflict and increased presence of armed forces. Harvesting and other livelihood activities have been seriously disrupted, leaving IDPs with an urgent need for food, healthcare, and other basic services. Increased displacement was observed in Chin State., In Rakhine State, the stateless population continues to face restrictions on freedom of movement, impeding their ability to seek medical care and further entrenching their segregation. Similarly, a number of displaced persons in Sittwe and Pauktaw IDP camps continue to suffer from outbreaks of acute water diarrhoea (AWD) due to inadequate access to health facilities.

The State Administration Council (SAC) sent about 60 soldiers to H--- village, and fighting happened between the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) and SAC-allied Border Guard Force (BGF) troops in H--- and E--- villages, Bilin Township. As a consequence, more than 2,000 villagers from five villages in Bilin Township have been displaced, eight schools have had to close, one villager was injured, houses and fruit trees were damaged, and one pig was killed. Displaced villagers are relying on other villagers for support, including food and shelter.[1], Introduction, When local Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[2] troops in Bilin Township attacked and occupied the Border Guard Force (BGF)[3] Yo Klah army camp on December 17th, 2021, many H--- and E--- villagers began to flee. On December 21st 2021, about 60 soldiers from State Administration Council (SAC)[4] Light Infantry Division (LID) #22, Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[5] #104 and allied BGF troops came to H--- village, where they used H--- monastery as a base of operations until January 8th 2022. On January 9th 2022, they moved to E--- village, where they used E--- villagers’ houses as a base of operations until January 11th 2022. During this period, the local KNLA attacked the SAC troops[6] and BGF troops almost every day. During the fighting, SAC and BGF soldiers fired mortars into villages and fighting occasionally took place in the villages. During this period, one H--- villager was injured, villagers’ homes and fruit trees in H--- and E--- were damaged and villagers’ livestock were killed., One villager injured by SAC shelling, Yo Klah Village Tract,[7] Bilin Township, Doo Tha Htoo District, On January 5th 2022, due to an increase in the frequency of fighting, more than 2,000 villagers from five villages—H---, O---, E---, W--- and Y---—began fleeing to other villages or to Bilin Town. On the evening of January 6th 2022, at 5:40 pm, during one of the incidents of fighting between the KNLA and the allied SAC and BGF troops, the SAC fired mortars into H--- village. One H--- villager, Saw I---, suffered an injury to his left hand and a major injury to his lower stomach, around his bladder. After the incident, at 6:30 pm, villagers sent him to the local community hospital in Hpwa Gaw for medical treatment., Ongoing fighting, displacement, and property damage, Fighting also occurred in H--- village on January 8th 2022. At about 8:00 pm, the SAC fired mortars into H--- village during the fighting, damaging one villager’s house. All villagers had already fled to other places, so no villagers were injured during the January 8th incident., On the morning of January 9th 2022, the SAC and BGF troops moved from H--- monastery to E--- village. They encountered KNLA troops in E--- village and fighting broke out between them. Fighting occurred on two occasions on January 10th 2022 in E--- village, and once on January 11th 2022. There were no villagers in the village, so none were injured, but one house was damaged, one pig died, and fruit trees such as coconut and papaya trees [that villagers rely on for their livelihood] were damaged. The SAC and BGF troops used villagers’ homes in E--- village as their base of operations from January 9th, 2022 until January 11th 2022., Eight schools have had to close, and all students and teachers have been fleeing to different places. Students cannot study anymore. Dormitory students are now being taken care of by Bilin Township Karen Women’s Organisation (KWO) staff., One local villager estimated that the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Bilin Township is now over 2,000, [based on the number of households from the five villages that have fled]. Those IDPs rely on other villagers for necessities such as shelter, food, and other needs. There is an urgent need for food and security for the IDPs., Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in September 2021.

The parts in square brackets are explanations added by KHRG., [2] The Karen National Liberation Army is the armed wing of the Karen National Union., [3] Border Guard Force (BGF) battalions of the Tatmadaw were established in 2010, and they are composed mostly of soldiers from former non-state armed groups, such as older constellations of the DKBA, which have formalised ceasefire agreements with the Burma/Myanmar government and agreed to transform into battalions within the Tatmadaw., [4] The State Administration Council (SAC) is the executive governing body created in the aftermath of the February 1st 2021 military coup. It was established by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on February 2nd 2021, and is composed of eight military officers and eight civilians. The chairperson serves as the de facto head of government of Myanmar and leads the Military Cabinet of Myanmar, the executive branch of the government. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of SAC chairperson following the coup., [5] A Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) comprises 500 soldiers. However, most Light Infantry Battalions in the Tatmadaw are under-strength with less than 200 soldiers. Yet up to date information regarding the size of battalions is hard to come by. LIBs are primarily used for offensive operations, but they are sometimes used for garrison duties., [6] The term most commonly used in referring to Myanmar’s armed forces is Tatmadaw. The term has been used by KHRG throughout its reporting history, and most consistently during periods of civilian government. Since the February 1st 2021 coup and the military’s establishment of the State Administration Council (SAC) as the executive governing body of Myanmar, Myanmar’s armed forces have also come to be referred to as the SAC military. KHRG uses the term SAC military in specific reference to the Myanmar military since the February 1st 2021 coup. During previous periods of military rule, KHRG also used the names adopted by the military government in referring to the Tatmadaw (i.e. SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council] between 1988 to 1997, and SPDC [State Peace and Development Council] from 1998 to 2011), because these were the terms commonly used by villagers in KHRG research areas., [7] A village tract is an administrative unit of between five and 20 villages in a local area, often centred on a large village.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/doo-tha-htoo-district-short-update-ongoing-fighting-bilin-township-leads-more-2000
Seeking justice amidst chaos: methods to identify and document individuals implicated in crimes against the Rohingya in August 2017,Analysis,BioMed Central,Protection and Human Rights,2 Mar 2022,"Jennifer Leigh, Alexander Blum, Agnes Petty, Andrea Woods, Parveen Parmar & Chris Beyrer, Conflict and Health volume 16, Article number: 9 (2022), Abstract, Background, Documenting perpetrators of human rights violations enables effective prosecution and can help prevent future atrocities. Doing so calls for collecting reliable data using verifiable and transparent methodology. We present methods used to document crimes and identify alleged perpetrators implicated in the 2017 attacks against Rohingya civilians in Myanmar. The findings and lessons-learned have relevance to contemporary crises with widespread atrocities., Methods, A mixed-methods assessment conducted from May to July 2018 included: (1) cross-sectional quantitative surveys among leaders of affected hamlets in northern Rakhine State, (2) qualitative interviews to record hamlet-level accounts, and (3) clinical evaluations of survivors of violence. Survey respondents who reported violence and destruction in each hamlet were asked to identify perpetrators of those acts, including known role or affiliation. The reported names were reviewed for clarity and divergent spellings, repeated references were aggregated, and the names and roles were analyzed and classified by location and affiliation., Results, 143 individuals were implicated in atrocities committed across three Northern Rakhine townships. Each was independently identified by at least three separate survey respondents as directly committing violence or destruction in their hamlet of origin, or as witnessed while fleeing to Bangladesh. Two-thirds (69%) of identified perpetrators were reported by four or more participants and 47% by five or more. Some form of additional identifying information, was provided for 85% of names. The most common affiliations were: Myanmar army (n = 40), Border Guard Police (n = 32), Village Tract Administrators (n = 17), and extremists (n = 25)., Conclusions, The methodology presented here yielded a unique record of individuals purported to have directly committed acts of violence and destruction in Rakhine State in August 2017, forming the most extensive record of individuals implicated in ground-level perpetration of those crimes. This methodology can play a key role in accountability mechanisms for the Rohingya, and in other settings in which perpetrators are many and documentation of their crimes is difficult. The use of survey methods and standardized data collection amongst affected populations to comprehensively characterize crimes committed and to identify individuals implicated in those crimes can serve as a key tool in documentation and an important component of accountability.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/seeking-justice-amidst-chaos-methods-identify-and-document-individuals-implicated

Some 1,092 severe and moderate cases (606 girls) were found and the children were provided with nutrition treatment services., Funding Overview and Partnerships, UNICEF Myanmar Country Office is appealing for US$151.4 million in 2022 to address the needs of the targeted 1.7 million people, including an estimated 1.1 million children. During the reporting period, UNICEF received US$4.3 million from the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance and Germany to support immediate nutrition, health, WASH, education and child protection needs including the COVID-19 response. In addition, UNICEF Myanmar has carried forward US$14 million received in 2021 from the generous support of Japan/JICA, USA/USAID, Norway, European Commission/ECHO, GAVI the Vaccine Alliance, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), the Global Thematic Humanitarian Response and the Global Partnership for Education. UNICEF worked very closely with implementing partners at local level to provide humanitarian assistance to ensure continued access to basic social services. The UNICEF Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) appeal has a funding gap of 88 per cent. Without this funding, 81 per cent of targeted children will not be able to receive treatment and nutrition counselling services, and millions of children will continue to remain out of school without access to basic social services such as immunization., UNICEF expresses its gratitude to all the donors (private and public) for their contributions to support the children of Myanmar., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, At the beginning of 2022, UNICEF released its HAC appeal in Myanmar, scaling up its response to reach 1.7 million people. This includes 1.1 million children out of an estimated 5 million children in need of life-saving assistance since the start of the conflict in February 2021. The current reporting period has been characterized by an intensification of the conflict, and heavy prolonged hostilities have been reported in the northwest and southeast of the country. In January, fighting in Kayah and Kayin caused a mass influx of people to the neighbouring region of southern Shan, and further challenges with the telecommunication network, electricity and water supply were reported. There were also disruptions to fuel supplies and the transportation of food and non-food items due to checkpoints, restrictions and added scrutiny. This affected the humanitarian partners’ ability to reach IDP sites and host communities where there is an escalating need for life-saving services on health, education, water, food and shelter., As of 14 February 2022, the national total of IDPs reached a new high of 453,000 according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), as an extra 132,000 people have been displaced since 27 December 2021. Following the intense clashes in Kayah and Kayin, southern Shan now accounts for 59,800 IDPs, an increase of 30,600 compared to the end of 2021., Another surge in displacement is also reported in Sagaing, where airstrikes and bombardments have been reported, resulting in 146,500 people being displaced, the highest number in the country.
The situation in the northwest, including Chin State, Magway, and Sagaing continues to deteriorate due to the escalation in fighting between the Myanmar Armed Forces, local People’s Defense Forces (PDF) and Chinland Defence Forces., Humanitarian assistance in the region is hindered by fighting, security concerns and travel restrictions, with only a few transporters providing services, impacting costs. Additionally, the activity of some partners has been delayed due to banking restrictions and difficulties in withdrawing cash., Despite the above-mentioned challenges, UNICEF and its partners have helped 152,747 people, including 87,320 children during the reporting period, in the areas of nutrition, health, water, sanitation and hygiene promotion, child protection, education, social policy and accountability. This assistance would not be possible without the collaboration of dedicated partners, especially the local organizations who have been a strong ally in ensuring a better reach of marginalized communities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-myanmar-humanitarian-situation-report-reporting-period-1-january-28-february

Protection and Human Rights",1 Mar 2022,"On Sunday, 27 February 2022, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (""ICC"" or ""the Court""), Mr Karim A. A. Khan QC, concluded a five-day visit to Dhaka and Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. This represented the first visit by the Prosecutor of the Court to Bangladesh., During the visit, Prosecutor Khan emphasised that the investigation being conducted by his Office into crimes within the Court's jurisdiction allegedly committed against the Rohingya from Myanmar would be a priority during his tenure. He confirmed to all stakeholders that he had allocated additional resources to the investigative team and was seeking to accelerate the collection and analysis of evidence, which had previously been impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic., Prosecutor Khan delivered this message directly to survivors and affected communities during his visit to Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, home to hundreds of thousands of members of the Rohingya community who have fled violence in Myanmar. In meetings with Rohingya women and youth activists, Prosecutor Khan discussed how his Office can further empower them to contribute to the investigation. During a meeting with local Imams and other religious leaders, the Prosecutor also addressed ways that Rohingya leaders can support victims of sexual and gender-based violence to come forward with their accounts in the context of the Office's ongoing investigations., ""We are here to work with you to build the foundations of justice. The road to accountability will not be simple, but it is a goal we can only achieve by working together, as a partnership between us"", stated the Prosecutor., During the course of the visit, Prosecutor Khan also held several productive meetings with officials of the Government of Bangladesh, and engaged with diplomatic corps and representatives of civil society organisations in Dhaka. Meetings were held with their Excellencies, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina; Minister of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, Mr Anisul Huq; State Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Abdul Momen; Foreign Secretary, Mr Masud Bin Momen, and Secretary for Maritime Affairs, Rear Admiral (retd.) Khurshed Alam., In his meeting with the Prime Minister, the Prosecutor recognised the crucial role that Bangladesh had played in providing refuge to the Rohingya as they fled Myanmar in 2017. ""That decision represented a moment of true empathy and courage. It also demonstrated the understanding among the Bangladeshi people of the impact of atrocity crimes, based on their own lived experience. This approach of courageous solidarity continues to be reflected in the assistance provided by Bangladesh to our work in pursuit of justice for the Rohingya community"", stated the Prosecutor., The Prosecutor expressed his sincere appreciation to the authorities of Bangladesh for facilitating his visit. He also expressed his gratitude to the non-governmental organisations and United Nations partners that had supported his direct engagement with survivors and affected communities in Cox's Bazar., The Prosecutor held a press conference in Dhaka at the conclusion of his mission to Bangladesh, fielding questions from local and international media present. During the press conference, the Prosecutor announced his intention to undertake additional visits to Bangladesh in order to further support and advance the work of his Office in relation to this investigation., The Prosecutor had the following message at the conclusion of his visit:, ""I am profoundly grateful for the generosity and support shown to me by the Bangladeshi people and the Rohingya community during this visit. As I stated to survivors in Cox's Bazar: We are here to serve you and help deliver justice. I am leaving here confident that with the renewed focus of my Office on this investigation, combined with the strengthened partnerships we have developed with survivors and national actors, we can now enter a phase of accelerated action. It is my hope and expectation that this will ultimately lead to those that may be responsible for atrocity crimes committed against the Rohingya community being held accountable in accordance with the law."", Background:, In November 2019, ICC Judges granted the former Prosecutor Bensouda's request to open a full investigation into alleged crimes within the ICC's jurisdiction in the Situation in Bangladesh/Myanmar (read her statement following the Judges' authorisation to proceed with an investigation by clicking here)., The Prosecutor may investigate any crimes which fall within the ICC's jurisdiction - and which were committed at least in part on the territory of Bangladesh (or any other State Party or State formally accepting the jurisdiction of the ICC), insofar as the crimes are sufficiently linked to the situation, and irrespective of the nationality of the perpetrators. In this context, the investigation may cover alleged crimes committed since 1 June 2010, the date of entry into force of the Rome Statute for Bangladesh (or from the date of entry into force of the Rome Statute for any other relevant State Party), and includes any future crimes, as long as they are sufficiently linked to the situation., Source: Office of the Prosecutor | Contact: OTPNewsDesk@icc-cpi.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/icc-prosecutor-karim-khan-qc-concludes-first-visit-bangladesh-underlines-commitment
Statement: Rohingya Genocide Trial Sends Important Signal,News and Press Release,RI,Protection and Human Rights,28 Feb 2022,"Please see below statement from Refugees International Deputy Director for Africa, Asia, and the Middle East Daniel P. Sullivan:, ""The continuation of the Rohingya genocide trial at the International Court of Justice is an important signal of accountability. The case against the state of Myanmar for its crimes against the Rohingya people comes even as the Myanmar military continues to commit atrocities against other ethnic minorities and anyone who protests their illegal seizure of power., The failure to properly address the crimes committed against the Rohingya has undoubtedly emboldened the military junta's sense of impunity---leading up to the coup that is now wreaking havoc across the country. The ICJ trial exposes these crimes and sets the stage for a more inclusive and peaceful future Myanmar by demonstrating to the perpetrators and victims alike that such violence will not be tolerated., The trial is also a reminder of the fact that the United States is yet to recognize, itself, the extent of the crimes against the Rohingya. It is long past time for the United States to take that important step and make an official determination that the crimes committed against the Rohingya people are crimes against humanity and genocide."", Refugees International has urged U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to make a Rohingya genocide determination, including through a joint letter from 95 organizations. The letter builds on Refugees International's efforts with the previous U.S. administration as part of the #CallitGenocide campaign, which included a nearly 9,000-signature petition and a legal and human rights experts letter (signed by two senior officials in the Biden administration).

Gambia calls for justice as Rohingya face dire threats,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,28 Feb 2022,"Hearings End on Myanmar’s Preliminary Objections to Genocide Case, Manny Maung
Myanmar Researcher, Asia Division, Shayna Bauchner
Researcher, Asia Division, A week of legal proceedings at the International Court of Justice in the Hague ended with Gambia making a plea for the judges to move swiftly and ensure that justice for the Rohingya is delayed no longer., On February 28, the hearings on Myanmar’s preliminary objections to Gambia’s case on the alleged genocide against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar came to a close. Yet the court could take a year before it decides on whether the case can proceed. In the meantime, the court’s 2020 order to protect the 600,000 Rohingya remaining in Myanmar is still in place, providing a measure of protection. If the case proceeds, it would take several years before the court reaches a judgment., While the representation of Myanmar at the court by junta officials has raised concerns, some Rohingya activists have welcomed hearing directly from those considered responsible for the atrocities in northern Rakhine State., Rohingya activist Yasmin Ullah says watching the perpetrators of mass violence face the court has even been cathartic. “We have not heard once from the military in a legal court as they have always acted by proxy,” she said in a recent discussion., The momentum to hold Myanmar’s military accountable is building, with a universal jurisdiction case underway in Argentina and an investigation at the International Criminal Court into crimes against humanity connected to the forced deportation of Rohingya to neighboring Bangladesh., Achieving justice for the Rohingya has far-reaching consequences for all those who have suffered at the hands of Myanmar’s military. Abuses against the Rohingya have now echoed throughout Myanmar, as the commanders who oversaw the atrocities against the Rohingya and led a military coup more than a year ago are now carrying out apparent crimes against humanity against other groups across Myanmar., In its closing statements, Gambia argued that Myanmar’s objections to the genocide case were merely a delaying tactic, and that any further delay in the proceedings may risk further atrocities against the Rohingya. If the case proceeds, Myanmar will need to respond to Gambia’s factual allegations that its security forces took part in a genocidal campaign against the Rohingya, an opportunity that many victims and their families have long been waiting for.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/gambia-calls-justice-rohingya-face-dire-threats

This is particularly the case in terms of loss of livelihoods, lack of safety and protection measures, deterioration of physical and mental wellbeing, and lack of access to basic goods and services. In this context, many women can no longer afford to buy personal hygiene items or adequately nutritious food., The humanitarian crisis in Myanmar is complex and multi-dimensional, characterized by ongoing armed conflict, inter-communal tensions, and widespread displacement., An estimated 14.4 million people are estimated to be in need of humanitarian aid in Myanmar. ACTED, A year on from the conflict which began in February 2021, more than 400,000 people have been displaced. Thus further exacerbating pre-existing vulnerabilities and leading to heightened needs amongst a population already in the midst of an economic and public health crisis following the outbreak of COVID-19., In response, ACTED, together with a local partner - is implementing a project entitled ""Emergency Response to Vulnerable Female Displaced Persons in Kayah State, Myanmar and Mae Hong Son, Thailand"". This project is funded by UNFPA and targets the most vulnerable women and girls (including pregnant and lactating women) affected by the conflict in three township areas (Loikaw, Demawso and Hpruso) with high concentrations of vulnerable internally displaces persons., ACTED's response to provide access to hygiene kits and nutrition, As part of this emergency project, ACTED supports women and girls with nutrition kits that include rice, cooking oil, iodine salt, sugar, wheat flour, and Bengal gram, as well as dignity kits that include locally made longyi, shampoo, hand soap, toothpaste, toothbrush, sanitary pad, towel, hand sanitizers, and underwear. ACTED has so far distributed 6,000 dignity kits (5,000 in Kayah and 1,000 in Mae Hong Saung) to women and girls., ACTED also provided 2,000 nutrition packages to vulnerable pregnant and lactating women, allowing these women and girls to live with the dignity and safety they deserve. 1000 additional dignity kits for vulnerable displaced women and girls will also be distributed in 2022., ACTED ensures access to psychological support, Due to the armed conflict, most of the women have experienced extreme hardship, with many having lost family members, friends, homes, and entire lives, in addition to fleeing through dangerous areas and over long distances to reach the relative safety of camps. In order to support with the resulting deteriorating mental wellbeing, ACTED also provided mental health and psychosocial support (MPHSS) sessions to 58 women and girls. The sessions handled topics such as self-care management practices, deep breathing exercises, and group discussion therapy. The women participating in these sessions reported reduced stress and an improved mental state and outlook, as well as better coping mechanisms. Additionally, ACTED provided five survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) with needed services and covered costs for counselling, transportation fees, and medical needs., To ensure the success of the project, ACTED and a local partner continuously coordinated with the camp committee leaders, local authorities, village leaders, and religious leaders. However, the activities were still associated with a high risk for project staff, particularly during transportation. This includes a lack of security on the roads, checkpoints, and increased conflict.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/kayah-state-emergency-response-vulnerable-displaced-women

"Dooplaya District Situation Update: Indiscriminate shelling, fighting, forced labour, peace talks, and the COVID-19 pandemic, August to September 2021",Situation Report,KHRG,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",26 Feb 2022,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Kaw T’Ree (Kawkareik) Township, Dooplaya District in August and early September 2021, including indiscriminate shelling, fighting, forced labour, and the spread of COVID-19 infections. Indiscriminate shelling and fighting between the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) and State Administration Council (SAC) troops in and near villages led to the displacement of local villagers. SAC troops have also been using villagers as navigators and human shields when they are travelling from place to place. COVID-19 infections are on the rise in areas where SAC troops patrol and travel. A meeting was held in Kyaw Hta village tract between multiple armed groups, including the SAC, Border Guard Force (BGF) and Democratic Karen Benevolent Army (DKBA), to discuss the end of fighting and inform villagers about the peace process., Indiscriminate shelling and displacement, Four State Administration Council (SAC) military trucks carrying over ten soldiers were attacked on the road after they left A--- village, Poh Yay village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township Dooplaya District on August 23rd 2021. After their trucks were attacked, more SAC soldiers entered into the village [A--- village]. On August 28th 2021, at around 5:00 pm, SAC soldiers conducted indiscriminate shelling in A--- village. As a result, the local villagers had to hide in their [makeshift] bunkers for the night. Then most of the villagers fled from their village the next morning; only a few households did not flee that day. All of the men from the village fled, but a few women stayed. They [the women and villagers who stayed in the village] dared not stay at their own houses so they stayed together in one house. However, later they also got ready to flee because of the ongoing indiscriminate shelling and the presence of SAC troops. Some villagers fled to the other side of the Chay Yar Kloh River. One of the villagers reported that, “My father tried to go back into the village but there were more SAC soldiers present in the village, so he dared not go back. [Instead he] returned to the other side of the river.”, A--- villagers heard that the village head, who was forcibly arrested [date unknown] by the SAC troops, was released but they still haven’t seen him come back to the village yet. His family is also afraid to stay in the village., One villager from B--- village, Kwin Ka Lay village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township, Dooplaya District reported that, “We always have to flee when we hear mortar shelling.” She continued, “We heard mortar shelling and the sound of gunfire between Kyeh Doh [Kyaikdon] and A--- village around 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm.” All of the local villagers from [C---] village fled, including women and children. It was raining and they had to stay in someone’s hut (at the place they took refuge). There were seven families there., Three days ago [before the displacement, and interview on August 28th 2021], the local villagers [from C--- village, who had fled] heard that civilians in Kyeh Doh Town were taken for forced portering at 10:00 pm and that 39 people were arrested. They heard that from their relatives from Kyeh Doh Town. [This has heightened their concerns.] They are also experiencing food scarcity because they could not bring enough food when they fled. Some people have nothing left to eat. Dengue is another problem for them during displacement. The villagers, including children, had to flee in the rain. They can get medicine such as paracetamol and amoxicillin [an antibiotic] at the Back Pack Health Worker Team (BPHWT) clinic but they are only given the exact dose [of the medicine prescribed]. The local villagers from D--- village and E--- village, Poh Yay village tract, Kaw T’Ree Township fled as well. All of the children who fled are from the same village [D--- village]., On September 3rd 2021, at 8:00 pm in G--- village, Taw Naw Mu Htaw area, Kaw T’Ree Township, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) [unidentified battalion number] attacked the [local] SAC army camp. The mortar shells fell on one [G---] villager’s house and fragments of the mortar shells fell beside the house. According to the local villagers, people in the house were not injured.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/dooplaya-district-situation-update-indiscriminate-shelling-fighting-forced-labour

Recovery and Reconstruction
Shelter and Non-Food Items",25 Feb 2022,"Summary of major revisions made to emergency plan of action:, Disaster preparedness stocks, Since the situation in Myanmar remains uncertain and supply chain and banking system have been disrupted, it is viewed as crucial to be better prepared should civil unrest continue to escalate. This includes increasing buffer for prepositioned stocks as reported in the first operational update for this emergency appeal. Due to the disruption of supply chain for non-food items (NFIs) in country, the initial plan to source the items locally has been changed to international procurement. The detailed revision of mobilization table to cover disaster preparedness stocks to be sourced internationally, both through in-kind and cash donation, can be found in the last Operation Update here., Plan to revise Emergency Appeal and to extend operation timeframe by one year, This operation update for the MDRMM016 emergency appeal informs the need for revision of the appeal., The operation has been experiencing delays in implementation due to the following reasons:, Given the shifting operating context in Myanmar, importation of goods is becoming increasingly restrictive. Since September 2021, all agencies have been reporting challenges and significant delays in procurement of medical equipment and other core humanitarian response items. These are a result of limitations in both the global supply chain, as well as staffing and systems limitations in key ministries due to the ongoing Civil Unrest., Access for humanitarian organizations in many parts of the country remain challenging due to security restrictions, stringent administrative authorization requirements and COVID-19 related restrictions., Civil unrest and clashes between parties are deteriorating, an increased movement of displaced people have been recorded in many parts of the country, especially in Kayin, Kayah, and also increasing movement along the borders with Thailand and India. Some of the initially targeted people have moved to other states or townships, which further complicates targeting and implementing the operation., Disruption and limitations in the banking system, including access to cash through bank transfers and cash withdrawal, have impacted the pace of the implementation., The entire country is affected by the deteriorating economy and rising of prices, local market instability and disruption of essential services. The high rate of population movement following increase in violence across country has complicated the beneficiary selection process. The above conditions have halted MRCS cash intervention – both cash for food and multipurpose cash grant – that was planned as a lifesaving response. Market monitoring is being monitored continuously to ensure relevance to the plan and as the condition allows, cash intervention will resume., During the second and third quarter of 2021, restriction to movement and access from initial preparations, coordination and data collection for most activities have been hampered by COVID-19 following the surge of Delta variant. As situation remains uncertain with civil unrest and clashes escalate, the number of displaced people is increasing along with the urgent need of food, shelter, water and sanitation, and basic health care and protection., A revision to Emergency Appeal and Operational Strategy, which will happen, will elaborate the detailed plan, changes in operational strategy and delivery mechanism, as well as will capture the timeframe extension for activities. Modification of this emergency appeal operation will also accommodate some delivery delays of relief assistance and prepositioned stocks., The IFRC continues to seek the kind support of donors towards this Emergency Appeal to enable the Myanmar Red Cross Society to continue to help meet the humanitarian needs of displaced people, as well as the local community affected by the ongoing civil unrest in the country., A. SITUATION ANALYSIS, Since Myanmar’s military intervention on 1 February 2021, the country has remained in a state of political crisis as the economy falters and the humanitarian situation worsens. The security and humanitarian situation across Myanmar remains tense, with escalating violence and armed clashes in multiple states and regions., With civilians bearing the brunt of ongoing armed clashes in multiple states and regions, the increase in violence has caused widespread displacement and significant humanitarian needs. Clashes have intensified particularly in Kayin, Kayah, Chin states as well as in Magway and Sagaing regions, resulting in increasing civilian casualties, destruction of people’s properties and internal and cross-border displacement. As of 31 January 2022,1 there are currently 811,900 internally displaced people in Myanmar. Of which, about 441,500 people displaced across Myanmar by clashes and insecurity since 1 February 2021. The southern part of Myanmar (Kayin, Kayah, and Southern Shan) recorded the highest new internal displacement with 229,500 IDPs (52 per cent), followed by the northwest part (136,300 IDPs in Sagaing, 21,400 IDPs in Magway and 33,800 IDPs in Chin – that contributes 43.4% of total IDPs). Around 15,000 people have crossed the borders into neighboring country of India since 1 February 2021. More than 2,200 houses and other civilian properties have been burnt down or destroyed, mainly in Chin (800), Kayah (654), Sagaing (529), and Magway (223)., There has been a significant development of displacement rate within Myanmar following the increase of violence and security-related incidents in December 2021. According to the UNHCR displacement statistics, it is recorded about 27 per cent of increase in internal displacement within the month of December 2021 alone. Intense fighting in the southeast of Myanmar has triggered series of large-scale displacement with tens of thousands forced to flee their homes seeking refuge at places of worship, community centers, in host communities or in the jungle. The main needs are for food, healthcare services and winterization items to cope with cold weather., The Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) continues against the State Administration Council (SAC) in towns and villages across the country. There has been disruption to the basic operations of the state, as well as trade, banking and construction. Significant price rises of basic food commodities have been recorded in many areas, while formal medical care and health services at hospitals, including maternal and new-born healthcare, have become extremely limited. Targeted attacks directed at government offices and Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) targets remain common, mainly involving explosive devices and more recently car-bombs, Humanitarian Needs Overview for Myanmar 20222 that was published on 31 December 2021 predict that approximately a quarter of population or more than 14 million people will be classified as having humanitarian needs in 2022. This increase is driven by the social, economic and health impacts of COVID-19, worsening food insecurity, as well as conflict-driven displacement and protection needs since the events of 1 February 2021.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-civil-unrest-response-operation-update-n-2-mdrmm016

Health
Protection and Human Rights",25 Feb 2022,"This Situation Update describes events occurring in Doo Tha Htoo [Thaton] District between August and September 2021, and includes information on education, health, livelihood and militarisation in the area. Border Guide Force (BGF) and State Administration Council (SAC) troops forced villagers to act as porters and navigators while they were moving rations during troop rotation in Bilin Township. Throughout the district, local civilians faced livelihood challenges due to higher prices on food and goods, travel restrictions related to local COVID-19 measures and ongoing militarisation. Villagers in Doo Tha Htoo became ill and experienced symptoms associated with COVID-19, but could not confirm whether they were positive for COVID-19 because there were no testing materials in the community and the SAC has prohibited civilians from transporting medicines from the town. While the Karen Education and Culture Department (KECD) schools are open, most government schools are not, and as a result some villagers have opened private schools in their own villages.[1], Introduction, This Doo Tha Htoo (Thaton) District situation update includes information on the topics of health, education, armed group activities and local civilians’ livelihoods within the period of August 1st 2021 to September 30th 2021., Health, Currently, symptoms of COVID-19 have been spreading in most of the villages [in Doo Tha Htoo District]. Meanwhile, no organisations have come to give villagers [medical] check-ups or provide COVID-related medical training. According to local civilians, the State Administration Council (SAC)[2] Military Operations Command (MOC)[3] #8 from Pein Ne Taw camp has also prohibited civilians from transporting medicine out of the towns [any towns in the district]., According to a local civilian, people have experienced symptoms of COVID-19 in all five townships of Doo Tha Htoo District. However, no COVID-19 test materials [test kits] were available in local communities, so villagers could not confirm whether they have COVID-19. However, recovered villagers reported experiencing symptoms like cough, fever, difficulty breathing, vomiting, loss of smell and dizziness [symptoms commonly associated with COVID-19]. Local civilians do not know whether these are positive COVID-19 cases due to lack of knowledge about COVID-19 [and lack of testing], and so assumed the illness was a type of seasonal flu., The local civilians who had those symptoms and assumed they were sick with flu, but who went to P’Lan Kaung Htaik Hospital in Hpa-an Township for treatment, tested positive for COVID-19 at the hospital. However, there have been no reports of villagers [in the district] dying due to COVID-19. Therefore, the local civilians have said that they are not highly concerned [about COVID-19]., If the civilians [in Bilin Township] try to transport healthcare and medical supplies, they have to pass through the SAC MOC #8 checkpoint at Pein Ne Taw army camp. One local villager stated that during the SAC checks in Bilin Township, they [the SAC] confiscate or destroy medicines or ask for a fine from the transporter. Due to the difficulty of getting medical supplies to the villages, villagers have been treating suspected COVID-19 cases using traditional methods such as boiling herbal roots and leaves, as well as [taking already available western medicines] according to the instructions of village healthcare staff., Education Situation, The schools in Bilin Township, Hpa-an Township, Kyaikto Township, and Thaton Township, Doo Tha Htoo District have been unable to reopen since the military coup. According to the local villagers, there are government schools, mixed schools, private schools, monastery schools, and Karen Education and Culture Department (KECD)[4] schools. The government schools were closed, so Education Department staff from the SAC military government had a meeting with local civilians and staff of the KECD about reopening those [SAC] schools. The local villagers and Karen National Union (KNU)[5] agreed to reopen the [SAC] schools. However, in one village in Bilin Township, the SAC military government staff told the local civilians [that the villagers would have] to take responsibility for [the safety of] their staff [SAC teachers]. Since local villagers have to ensure their own security, they could not take responsibility for the SAC teachers and so the SAC schools could not reopen [in that village in 2021]. As result, the villagers [in that same village] founded a local private school by requesting that [some of the] educated young people in the local villages teach their children. In other cases, villagers from other villages requested permission to open schools at the monastery [buildings]. As a result, some villagers have opened private schools in their own villages, and some have opened schools at local monasteries. A few schools run by the SAC did reopen, and a small number of students attended those schools; however, most government schools did not reopen and some villages also do not have private schools. The KECD schools are open as usual., Movement of armed groups, forced labour and human shields, According to the villagers, fighting happened once every three or four days in Brigade 1 (Doo Tha Htoo District). On August 10th 2021, Colonel Saw P’Lay, who was the brigadier of Brigade 1 passed away. After he died, Colonel Saw Soe Myint Htway became brigadier and Colonel Saw Chit Thu became operations commander (G3), according to a representative of the KNU., Fighting occurred between Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[6] forces and Border Guard Force (BGF)[7] troops affiliated with SAC troops[8] once every two or three days in KNLA Battalion #1’s area of operation. One of the villagers said that mortars fired during the SAC’s indiscriminate shelling [during the fighting] landed on the villagers’ farms, causing security concerns for villagers when they would go to their paddy fields, hill farms, plantations and gardens., There have been multiple occasions of fighting that have occurred in KNLA Battalion #3’s area of operation as well because SAC troops have increased their movements along the Bilin River, Kyaikto Township, Doo Tha Htoo District. One villager said that local villagers faced difficulty with transportation [travel to their farms, transportation of goods and food, such as transporting fruit and other products to sell] for their livelihoods because of the fighting., Fighting also occurred in the area where KNLA Battalion #2 operates in Thaton Township. The SAC set up a checkpoint in front of the MOC #8, Battalion #9 army camp on the vehicle road between Win Pa, Wi Yaw and Pi Nei Taw villages, making travel and transportation more difficult for civilians. One of the villagers said that the SAC army camp does not allow them to transport rice, health and medical supplies, P’Leh fertilizer [a specific type of fertilizer], and electrical materials such as batteries, wires, and engine oil [most likely because of their potential use in making explosives]. They had to pass the questioning [checking] of the [SAC army camp] gate keepers whenever they transported [any] supplies. After they were questioned [by the SAC troops from the army camp], their supplies were confiscated and/or destroyed and they also had to pay fines [to the SAC]., One of the villagers said that the SAC had increased its military movement in the area where Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO)[9] Battalion #2 operates, so fighting has occurred between KNDO and SAC troops. Since August 7th 2021, SAC Battalion #406 under MOC #8 from Lay Kay military camp has been conducting military operations in Myit Kyo, Kyo Waing, Htee Hpa Doh Hta [Pyin Ma Pin Seik] and Yo Klah [Kya Thaung Seik] village tracts[10] [in Bilin Township]. This has led to several instances of fighting [with the local KNDO]., On August 12th 2021 [or possibly August 11th 2021][11] [SAC troops] gathered eastern and western E--- village elders, B--- village elders, and eastern and western H--- village elders in E--- village and threatened those elders, saying that, if the KNLA shot at them [the SAC troops] again, they would fire mortars into the villages. [The SAC troops] also ordered the village elders to send 15 villagers from each village to accompany the SAC when they continued on their way [to Yo Klah (Kyat Thaung Seik) army camp]. [According to another KHRG report, in the end only four villagers in total accompanied the troops.[12]] After they departed from E--- village, they used the villagers as human shields for their protection and then released those villagers at the exit gate of the village [H--- village], according to one E--- villager. The villager also said that the SAC detained everyone they saw in their operational area along the road [between E--- and H--- villages] and forced them [the detained villagers] to follow them [and to act as human shields]. On August 12th 2021, the SAC troops arrived at Yo Klah army camp, and they [the troops] also stayed at the monastery [which is near the army camp]. The SAC troops came to Yo Klah army camp in order to observe and check on the ration storage location and army camp land of BGF Battalion #2 under #1013. On August 16th 2021, they [the SAC troops] departed from Yo Klah army camp and [arbitrarily] detained everyone they met on their way and released those villagers when they arrived at the next village. Because of this, villagers [said that they] had to hide and sleep in the forest and beside streams in order to escape being detained [and forced to serve as human shields]. One of the villagers also said that they [the villagers] have been facing difficulties in order to go to their plain farms, plantations, hill farms and gardens because they worry that they would meet SAC troops and they would be [arbitrarily] detained by the SAC [and made to perform forced labour or act as human shields]., On August 19th 2021, the SAC troops went to the Yo Klah army camp with BGF Battalion #1013, accompanied by the Company #2 Camp Commander and Company 2nd-in-Command Lieutenant Bo[13] Wa Tho, who ordered villagers [to meet with them]. He [Bo Wa Tho] ordered villagers to accompany them [the troops] when they withdrew their troops from the army camp on August 20th 2021. The villagers said that they were very happy that they [the SAC troops] were going to withdraw from the army camp, so villagers were ready to accompany the SAC troops out of the army camp on that day [August 20th]. However, it [the withdrawal] did not happen and the [BGF] told the villagers that they [the BGF] are under SAC [command] and they didn’t get permission from their senior authority [it is unclear whether this refers to Senior General Min Aung Hlaing or Bo Chit Thoo, the commander of the BGF] to withdraw from the army camp. According to the villagers, they had to waste a day of their time waiting for the BGF troops to withdraw from the army camp.[14], On September 1st 2021, [soldiers from] BGF #1013 departed from their army camp headquarters in Ka Taing Ti Town to travel to Yo Klah army camp to exchange troops and transport rations. On September 3rd 2021, one of the BGF vehicles transporting rations was attacked by KNLA troops at the place between Pu Yit Kho village and Ka Meh village. The BGF vehicle was slightly damaged. [After that incident], they [BGF and SAC] sent back their [damaged] vehicle and then seized three of the villagers’ vehicles from Win Ta Pan village and ordered them [the owners of the vehicles] to transport rations for them [the BGF troops]. According to one local villager, the villagers who were forced to drive [for the BGF troops] were deeply concerned they would encounter fighting [between the KNLA and BGF troops affiliated with the SAC] during the time they were forced to drive., They [SAC and BGF troops] arrived at Lay Kay army camp on September 5th 2021, and then they travelled to Myit Kyon village on September 11th 2021. On September 14th 2021, they seized six villagers’ tractors and ordered them [the tractor owners] to transport rations from Myit Kyon village to Kyon Waing village. On September 18th 2021, according to information gathered in the village, they forced a total of 104 villagers to carry their rations and act as human shields for their [the troops’] protection on the journey from Kyon Waing village to E--- village. They [the SAC and BGF] forced the villagers to carry rations [from Kyon Waing to E--- village] twice. After that, they also forced 140 villagers from eastern and western E--- village, 11 villagers from B--- village and 97 villagers from eastern and western H--- village to act as porters to carry [the troops’] rations and act as human shields on the journey from E--- village to Yo Klah army camp. According to the local villagers, there were girls and boys under the age of 18 [who were forced to act as human shields and as porters]., According to local leaders, the SAC troops that operate [in Bilin Township] are BGF Company #3 under Battalion #1013, led by Company 2nd-in-Command Lieutenant Ka Don, and SAC Battalion #406 under MOC #8. On September 18th 2021, fighting broke out in front of Saw O---‘s shop [the shop is known by the owner’s name] in E--- village. [As a result,] one BGF soldier died and two other soldiers were injured. In response, the BGF soldiers destroyed all the goods and burnt down Saw O---‘s shop. Moreover, one of the villagers said that they [SAC and BGF soldiers] indiscriminately fired mortars and shot at the roofs of villagers’ houses. One of the local villagers added that, whenever fighting occurs, villagers are the ones who suffer [the negative consequences]. It is just like [one of the common local] proverbs: “Whether the sharp material falls on leaves, or the leaves fall on sharp material, the leaves will be damaged.”, Civilian livelihood situation, The travel restrictions between villages due to the COVID-19 pandemic, along with military operations, fighting, and the increase in prices, have made it difficult for local villagers to buy rice and other goods. Half the local villagers need to buy rice and transport it from the town [because rice is more readily available in town]. The local villagers were facing [livelihood] difficulties because the SAC has placed limits on the amount of rice sacks that villagers are allowed to transport from the town [into the rural villages]. [In addition,] there are no job opportunities, so the villagers do not have any income and have been faced with [livelihood] difficulties. According to one of the local villagers, a majority of the civilians are working as day labourers and, since the price of rice and other products has increased, they are facing more difficulties buying food. Another villager said, “We have been facing livelihood challenges and it is more difficult when we are infected by COVID-19.” One of the local villagers also said, “Even when we work for our livelihood, we are full of worry because of the fighting.”, This report updates the situation in Doo Tha Htoo District. KHRG’s researcher received this information from local villagers., Further background reading on issues related to fighting between armed groups, education, and forced labour in Doo Tha Htoo District in Southeast Myanmar can be found in the following KHRG reports:, “Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: Forced labour, looting and skirmishes between the SAC and the KNLA, August 2021”, December 2021., “Doo Tha Htoo District Situation Update: Fighting between the BGF and KNLA, and pressure to close KECD schools (April to June 2021)**”, November 2021., “Doo Tha Htoo Situation Update: Fighting and indiscriminate shelling by SAC forces, April to May 2021**”, June 2021., Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in September 2021. It was provided by a community member in Doo Tha Htoo District who has been trained by KHRG to monitor human rights conditions on the ground. The names of the victims, their photos and the exact locations are censored for security reasons. The parts in square brackets are explanations added by KHRG., [2] The State Administration Council (SAC) is the executive governing body created in the aftermath of the February 1st 2021 military coup. It was established by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on February 2nd 2021, and is composed of eight military officers and eight civilians. The chairperson serves as the de facto head of government of Myanmar and leads the Military Cabinet of Myanmar, the executive branch of the government. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of SAC chairperson following the coup., [3] A Military Operations Command is composed of ten battalions for offensive operations. Most MOCs have three Tactical Operations Commands (TOCs), made up of three battalions each., [4] The Karen Education and Culture Department is the education department of the Karen National Union. Its main goals are to provide mother tongue education services to rural Karen populations in Southeast Myanmar, as well as to preserve the Karen language, culture and history. Despite being an important education provider in the region, it is not officially recognised by the Myanmar government., [5] The Karen National Union (KNU) is the main Karen political organisation. It was established in 1947 and has been in conflict with the Burma/Myanmar government since 1949. The KNU wields power across large areas of Southeast Myanmar and has been calling for the creation of a democratic federal system since 1976. Although it signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement in 2015, relations with the government remain tense., [6] The Karen National Liberation Army is the armed wing of the Karen National Union., [7] Border Guard Force (BGF) battalions of the Tatmadaw were established in 2010, and they are composed mostly of soldiers from former non-state armed groups, such as older constellations of the DKBA, which have formalised ceasefire agreements with the Burma/Myanmar government and agreed to transform into battalions within the Tatmadaw., [8] The term most commonly used in referring to Myanmar’s armed forces is Tatmadaw. The term has been used by KHRG throughout its reporting history, and most consistently during periods of civilian government. Since the February 1st 2021 coup and the military’s establishment of the State Administration Council (SAC) as the executive governing body of Myanmar, Myanmar’s armed forces have also come to be referred to as the SAC military. KHRG uses the term SAC military in specific reference to the Myanmar military since the February 1st 2021 coup. During previous periods of military rule, KHRG also used the names adopted by the military government in referring to the Tatmadaw (i.e. SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council] between 1988 to 1997, and SPDC [State Peace and Development Council] from 1998 to 2011), because these were the terms commonly used by villagers in KHRG research areas., [9] The Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO) was formed in 1947 by the Karen National Union and is the precursor to the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). Today the KNDO refers to a militia force of local volunteers trained and equipped by the KNLA and incorporated into its battalion and command structure; its members wear uniforms and typically commit to two-year terms of service., [10] A village tract is an administrative unit of between five and 20 villages in a local area, often centred on a large village., [11] KHRG previously reported the date as August 11th 2021 based on information received from another KHRG researcher who interviewed different villagers (see KHRG, “Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: Forced labour, looting and skirmishes between the SAC and the KNLA, August 2021”, December 2021). Because KHRG was not able to establish the exact date of the incident, August 12th 2021 has been kept as the official date reported in this Situation Update., [12] See KHRG, “Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: Forced labour, looting and skirmishes between the SAC and the KNLA, August 2021”, December 2021., [13] Bo is a Burmese title meaning ‘officer.’, [14] According to a previous report by KHRG, the SAC and affiliated BGF troops returned to Lay Kay army camp from Yo Klah army camp on August 23rd 2021. See KHRG, “Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: Forced labour, looting and skirmishes between the SAC and the KNLA, August 2021”, December 2021.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/doo-tha-htoo-district-situation-update-forced-portering-and-use-civilians-human

Protection and Human Rights",24 Feb 2022,"This Incident Report describes an event that occurred in Bu Tho Township, Mu Traw (Hpapun) District in January 2022. At about 2:55 pm on January 9th 2022, a villager from Meh Klaw village tract stepped on a landmine outside his village, sustaining serious injuries in the explosion. Local villagers were warned about the possibility of landmine contamination in the village vicinity, however, the landmine victim needed to forage in the nearby forest to secure a livelihood for his family. Following the incident, the villager was taken to the Military Operations Command (Byu Ha) Hospital in Hpapun Town for treatment but passed away after he arrived., (Excerpt), Part 3 – Complete Description of the Incident, Describe the Incident(s) in complete detail. For each incident, be sure to include 1) when the incident happened, 2) where it happened, 3) what happened, 4) how it happened, 5) who was involved, and 6) why it happened. Also describe any villager response(s) to the incident, the aftermath and the current living situation of the victims. Please use the space prepared below, and create an attachment if needed., On January 9th 2022, a 55-year-old villager named Saw H---, living in M--- village, Meh Klaw village tract, Bu Tho Township, Mu Traw (Hpapun) District went [to the nearby forest] to pick fruit from Daw Ka Tha trees (Oroxylum indicum [commonly known as the Indian Trumpet tree]) to sell. [The fruit from the tree is often eaten as a vegetable with fish paste and rice.] He would use the money he earned [selling Daw Ka Tha] to buy rice for his family. He had been to forage in the forest three times that day. The third time, at about 2:55 pm, he stepped on a landmine., As soon as the landmine exploded, he shouted out loud, calling for help. Hearing the sound of a man shouting, the villagers from M--- village went to find him at the location of the incident. Both his legs were badly injured due to the landmine explosion. At first, the villagers took him to his home. The villagers then sent him by car to the Military Operations Command (MOC) (Byu Ha) Hospital (100-bed tactical hospital) located in Hpapun Town. He passed away immediately after arriving at the hospital, without receiving treatment., Prior to the incident, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) had informed villagers from M--- village in advance that the area was contaminated with landmines. The State Adminstration Council (SAC) Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)#434 also warned the villagers not to leave the village [because of landmine contamination in the area]. However, there were no marks or signs showing precisely where the landmines had been planted. The villagers living in M--- village believe that the exploded landmine was planted by the KNLA., The villagers living in M--- village have never attended Mine Risk Awareness training as it has not been provided in the village. Therefore, the villagers have less knowledge of the risk of landmines. [Many also depend on foraging in the nearby forest to earn their livelihood, and thus are more vulnerable to the dangers of landmine contamination.], The landmine victim leaves behind two family members: his wife and 15-year-old daughter. As it is hard to travel and find jobs, the family is facing difficulty earning a livelihood. Currently, no organisation is providing support to the family of the landmine victim., M--- villagers have also reported their livestock being killed in landmine explosions. This, along with increased fighting and shelling along the road between Hpapun and K’Ma Moh (Kamarmaung) towns, has heightened villagers’ fear of travel in the area.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/mu-traw-district-incident-report-villager-died-due-landmine-explosion-bu-tho-township
Myanmar: EU oil and gas sanctions risk being ineffectual,News and Press Release,FIDH,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,25 Feb 2022,"Brussels, Paris — FIDH and its member organisation ALTSEAN-Burma welcome the EU’s latest sanctions on junta-linked entities, but are alarmed by the derogation (exemption), which expressly allows EU oil and gas operators remaining in Myanmar to pursue financial transactions with Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE)., On 21 February 2022, the EU announced the adoption of additional sanctions against individuals and entities for their involvement in serious human rights violations in Myanmar. MOGE, one of the listed entities, is a state-owned enterprise that has fallen under the control of the military junta since last year’s coup., Until now, the natural gas sector had remained untouched by international sanctions despite generating between USD 1 and 1.5bn per year for the military and representing up to 50% of the regime’s foreign currency inflow. EU sanctions against MOGE were expected to significantly hamper the military’s access to foreign currency, including from French oil giant TotalEnergies, which had been a key investor in this sector in Myanmar., However, the listing of MOGE is undermined by a dangerous derogation, which would enable existing transactions between EU operators and MOGE to be pursued despite the sanction regime. This derogation—which appears to be tailors-made to respond to Total Energies’ concerns in the context of its announced withdrawal from Myanmar—would enable EU operators to provide financial support to MOGE by authorising them to continue paying taxes and duties, and transfer shares and assets, to MOGE., FIDH and ALTSEAN-Burma believe this derogation is a huge missed opportunity for the EU, its member states, and its business sector to uphold their international human rights obligations. Freezing any financial and economic support to the junta must be a priority for the EU to avoid being complicit in widely documented crimes., In addition, the derogation may amount to an abuse of power and appears to be illegal, as it seems to violate EU treaty provisions and essential procedural requirements. If implemented, this derogation could be nullified by relevant jurisdictions., On numerous occasions, FIDH and other civil society groups had called on the EU to adopt sanctions against MOGE. Over the past year, the EU has adopted several rounds of sanctions in response to the situation, but these measures are merely symbolic, as they have not targeted the largest sources of foreign currency used by the junta to purchase military equipment deployed against civilians., BACKGROUND, TotalEnergies is a French company present in Myanmar, where it explores and extracts gas in the offshore Yadana field. The field is operated by a consortium that includes other foreign companies, such as Chevron (US) and PTT Exploration and Production (Thailand), in addition to MOGE. In this framework, TotalEnergies transfers large amounts of foreign currency, which directly or indirectly benefit MOGE, including revenue related to the gas exploitation, but also taxes and other duties., Although in January 2022 TotalEnergies announced that it would withdraw from Myanmar due to the human rights situation, this announcement does not stop the financial flows to the junta. As part of the withdrawal, the decommissioning of oil and gas wells would include the payment of related taxes and duties. In addition, the transfer of shares and interests in the context of the termination of contracts may both provide financial resources directly or indirectly to MOGE. During the six-month period before the two companies’ physical departure, and in the absence of sanctions, it is estimated that an additional USD 250 million could be transferred from the consortium to the military., EU sanctions are only applicable to EU citizens, EU entities, or individuals and entities present on EU territory. As a result, targeting MOGE, a Burmese entity, can be effective only vis-a-vis its relationships with EU entities.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-eu-oil-and-gas-sanctions-risk-being-ineffectual

Similarly, to previous weeks, new displacements occurred but also returns to the villages of origin. This indicates that the IDP population is very mobile and move according to the conflict situation and the presence of service and provision of assistance., In that sense, the continuous fighting in Demoso and Pekon townships resulted in the displacement of 2883 new IDPs to Hsihseng, Lawksawk, Pekon, Pinlaung townships in Shan south and also 493 new IDPs displaced towards Demoso township in Kayah State., Besides, 1296 IDPs from Myawaddy township displaced to the river sides due to the intensified clashes and airstrikes. In parallel, 4738 IDPs from southern part of Kawkareik Township who have been displaced in January 2022, returned to their villages in other parts of Kawkareik township after the withdrawal of Tatmadaw troops. In addition, 2269 IDPs have returned from Shan South to Loikaw Town.

Enabling Atrocities: UN Member States’ Arms Transfers to the Myanmar Military (A/HRC/49/CRP.1),UN Document,UN HRC,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",22 Feb 2022,"Myanmar: UN expert urges Security Council resolution to stop weapons fueling spike in military attacks on civilians, New report reveals weapons transfers to military junta by UN Member States, GENEVA (22 February 2022) – The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, issued a report to the UN Human Rights Council today that identifies States, including two permanent members of the Security Council, who have supplied weapons used against civilians since Myanmar’s military coup., The independent expert appealed to weapons exporting nations to immediately suspend their weapons sales and urged the convening of an emergency Security Council session to debate and vote on a resolution to, at minimum, ban those arms transfers that the Myanmar military are known to use to attack and kill Myanmar civilians., “It should be incontrovertible that weapons used to kill civilians should no longer be transferred to Myanmar. These transfers truly shock the conscience,” Andrews said. “Stopping the junta’s atrocity crimes begins with blocking their access to weapons. The more the world delays, the more innocent people, including children, will die in Myanmar.”, The Special Rapporteur identified China, Russia and Serbia as Member States who have, since the coup, been supplying the junta with weapons of the sort that are being used to attack civilians., “The people of Myanmar are imploring the UN to act,” he said. “They deserve an up-or-down vote on a Security Council resolution that will stop the sale of weapons being used to kill them. Too many families are finding themselves in the cross-hairs of weapons of war that Member States are supplying. This must end.”, The report, titled Enabling Atrocities: UN Member States’ Arms Transfers to the Myanmar Military, also names States who have authorized the transfer of weapons since 2018 when Myanmar military atrocity crimes against the Rohingya ethnic minority were widely documented and a UN Fact Finding Mission called for an immediate arms embargo. It includes the types and, where known, the amounts of weapons that have been transferred to the Myanmar military., “Despite the evidence of the military junta’s atrocity crimes being committed with impunity since launching a coup last year, UN Security Council members Russia and China continue to provide the Myanmar military junta with numerous fighter jets, armored vehicles, and in the case of Russia, the promise of further arms. During this same period, Serbia has authorized rockets and artillery for export to the Myanmar military., Last June the General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for Member States to prevent the flow of arms into Myanmar. “This was welcomed by the people of Myanmar, civil society organizations, and international human rights advocacy groups,” Andrews said. “The failure of the resolution to have any discernable impact on the crisis and the capacity of the junta to launch attacks on civilians, however, has led to anger and despair., “It is imperative that Member States and the Security Council act urgently to stop weapons sales to the military junta. Human lives, and Security Council credibility, are on the line., “While not a single member of the Security Council voted against the General Assembly resolution, the Security Council has not considered, let alone voted, on a resolution that could make the resolution binding on Member States., “I appeal to Member States of the UN Security Council who are appalled by the killing of Myanmar civilians to put forward a resolution to stop it. Transparency matters. The Security Council should consider, at the very least, a resolution to ban weapons that are being used by the Myanmar military to kill innocent people.”, The report also calls for coordinated action by Member States to cut the junta’s access to revenue, just as the people of Myanmar are doing through widespread boycotts on goods linked to the military., “Without legitimacy and against broad opposition among the people of Myanmar, the military junta operates as if it is a hostile military power. Military force is therefore its only means of attempting to exert control,” Andrews said., “While perceived by junta leaders as a strength, this large military is also a vulnerability as it requires significant resources to equip and sustain. If the revenues necessary to maintain such a military are reduced, the junta’s capacity to assault and terrorize the people of Myanmar will diminish.”, ENDS, Mr. Thomas Andrews (United States of America) is the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar.

Health
Protection and Human Rights",22 Feb 2022,"This Situation Update describes events occurring in Ta Kreh Township, Hpa-an District from April to June 2021. This report highlights issues related to the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM), the COVID-19 pandemic, and the education situation. After the military coup, many government staff joined the CDM and have been seeking temporary shelter in areas controlled by the Karen National Union (KNU). COVID-19 cases have increased, resulting in travel restrictions and an increase in the price of goods. Some villagers cannot afford to buy goods because they do not have jobs. In June 2021, one of the Karen primary schools reopened for one month but was closed again when COVID-19 cases increased. The school will reopen when the situation improves.[1], Introduction, This situation report covers events that occurred in Ta Kreh [Paingkyon] Township, Hpa-an District, in the period from April to June 2021, following the military coup. This situation update will discuss the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM)[2], COVID-19, and the education situation in Ta Kreh Township., The Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) and travel restrictions, In May 2021, CDM participants from different towns and districts came to H--- village, Ta Kreh Township, Hpa-an District. These CDM participants are of different ethnic and religious backgrounds and had different [professional] positions., In April 2021, there were no travel restrictions [in Hpa-an District]. An organisation [villagers were not able to identify the name of the organisation] came and provided training on issues such as healthcare, water purification, food preparation, healthcare for pregnant women and infants, sexual violence, and COVID-19 prevention. Since May 2021, however, it has become more difficult to travel because the State Administration Council (SAC)[3] has been searching for and arresting CDM participants. Therefore, it is not easy for this organisation to enter the area., COVID-19 and its impacts, In June 2021, COVID-19 cases increased, resulting in travel restrictions and an increase in the price of goods. Some villagers struggled to get food because they did not have jobs and were unable to earn their livelihoods. Furthermore, some villagers were infected with COVID-19 at the shop where the villagers used to buy goods. The SAC military government ordered the shop to close temporarily., Since the COVID-19 situation has grown worse, organisations, including the one noted above [that came to provide training], have been unable to come to Ta Kreh Township to organise activities., Other Healthcare, There was a pregnant woman in the area [Ta Kreh Towship] who needed to give birth via caesarean section (C-section), so she couldn’t give birth [in the village] and needed to go to the hospital [to give birth]. She went to the public hospital, but they rejected her [because they did not have capacity to treat her]. She then had to go to the private hospital to deliver her baby. After she recovered from childbirth, she came back and stayed at her mother’s house [in Ta Kreh Township]., Education, In June 2021, the Karen [Karen Education and Culture Department (KECD)[4]] primary school in T’Koo Traw village, Noh Hkwee village tract,[5] Ta Kreh Township, Hpa-an District, reopened because students from the other villages came to attend that school. There were four teachers and over 70 students attending the Karen [KECD] primary school. [At this time] Myanmar government schools were still closed. In July 2021, however, the majority of villagers were infected with COVID-19 and the school was closed for two weeks. If the situation improves, the school will reopen. The Karen National Union (KNU)[6] also announced a temporary closure of Karen schools., Conclusion, Though there might be many other events that occurred during this period in 2021, due to the COVID-19 situation, KHRG’s researcher was unable to travel [to collect other information] and so was not able to provide KHRG with information on other events. In 2021, there have been many challenges for the [local] community because of the military coup and the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the livelihood, education and travel situations are very different than they were before [the military coup and COVID-19]., Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in July. It was provided by a community member in Hpa-an who has been trained by KHRG to monitor human rights conditions on the ground. The names of the victims, their photos and the exact locations are censored for security reasons. The parts in square brackets are explanations added by KHRG., [2] On February 2nd 2021, healthcare workers at state-run hospitals and medical facilities across Myanmar spearheaded what is being referred to as a Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) consisting of labour strikes in protest against the February 1st 2021 military coup. The movement quickly spread to include civil servants from all sectors of the government who are walking off their jobs as a way of non-recognition and non-participation in the military regime. Because of the popularity of the movement, and its seminal role in wider protests across the country, some people have begun using it as a catch-all phrase to include other protest forms like boycotts and pot-banging., [3] The State Administration Council (SAC) is the executive governing body created in the aftermath of the February 1st 2021 military coup. It was established by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on February 2nd 2021, and is composed of eight military officers and eight civilians. The chairperson serves as the de facto head of government of Myanmar and leads the Military Cabinet of Myanmar, the executive branch of the government. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of SAC chairperson following the coup., [4] The Karen Education and Culture Department is the education department of the Karen National Union. Its main goals are to provide mother tongue education services to rural Karen populations in Southeast Myanmar, as well as to preserve the Karen language, culture and history. Despite being an important education provider in the region, it is not officially recognised by the Myanmar government., [5] A village tract is an administrative unit of between five and 20 villages in a local area, often centred on a large village., [6] The Karen National Union (KNU) is the main Karen political organisation. It was established in 1947 and has been in conflict with the Burma/Myanmar government since 1949. The KNU wields power across large areas of Southeast Myanmar and has been calling for the creation of a democratic federal system since 1976. Although it signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement in 2015, relations with the government remain tense.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/hpa-district-situation-update-civil-disobedience-movement-covid-19-and-education
"Myanmar South East - Monthly Displacement Snapshot - Trend of people displaced in South East since Feb 2021 and remain displaced, as of 31 Jan 2022",Infographic,UNHCR,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",21 Feb 2022,"SE Weekly Highlights, In January 2022, the number of new IDPs have significantly increased with a total of 85,000 new verified IDPs. Early January in the South-East, 21,300 people were displaced from Kayin State in the Lay Kay Kaw area of Myawaddy Township, following Tatmadaw airstrikes and clashes between security forces and a combined force of the Karen National Union (KNU) and People’s Defence Force (PDF)., In the second week, due to indiscriminative shelling and armed clashes about 15,200 people were displaced to Kayah, Kayin and Shan (South) states and Tanintharyi Region, in addition to some 890 people estimated to have ed to Thailand. In total, some 2,800 people remained on the Thai side of the border in early January. With the conflict intensifying in Kayah state, the number of new IDPs in Shan State (South) increased with 6,130 individuals were displaced from Pekon town and nearby communities due to continued clashes between the Tatmadaw and local resistance groups, seeking safety at various villages and locations further in Pekon Township. Furthermore, over 2,200 people were displaced to Mongkaing town between in January due to inter-EAO conflict between the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS) and Shan State Progress Party (SSPP)., The third week was not different as the number of displaced people continued to increase with 17,712 newly displaced individuals. The main hosting area for new IDPs remained Taunggyi and its surrounding townships in Shan (South) State with 15,238 new IDPs. Furthermore, the conflict within Kayah State had brought about 2,125 newly displaced to Demoso, Hpruso and South Pekon. However, the continuous airstrikes and clashes in many parts of the SE had led to secondary displacements to safer locations with better access to services and assistance. In Kayin State, clashes intensied in Myawaddy, Kawkareik and Hpapun townships with shelling and airstrikes as well as attacks on the roads. 186 people displaced towards Hpa-an and Hpapun, most of them as secondary displacements., During the fourth week, the number of displaced people continued to increase with 19,765 new IDPs, which brought the total number to stand at 237,700. This figure included 237,100 IDPs in Kayah, Kayin, Shan (South) States and Bago East and Tanintharyi Region. In addition, it is estimated that 600 people remained on the Thai side of the border but spontaneous and/or forced returns occurred during the week. The reception area for new IDPs continued to be Taunggyi and its surrounding townships in Shan (South) State with 10,000 new people displaced. In Kayah State while the number has decreased compared to the previous week, airstrikes by the Tatmadaw had been reportedly taking place in Hpruso, Demoso and Loikaw impacting civilians. In Kayin State, clashes heavily intensified in Myawaddy, Kawkareik and Hpapun townships with shelling and airstrikes as well as attacks on the roads. The situation is worsening in the area with a significant increase of IDPs., Toward the end of January, the total number of IDPs had slightly decreased compared to the previous weeks, a total of 232,600 people were displaced, including an estimated of 600 people still remaining in the Thai border. The decrease is due to the return of about 5,900 people from South Shan to Pekon Township. In this area the conflict has temporarily ceased allowing people to return. The cold weather, lack of shelter, lack of proper clothing, lack of water and food should are considered as the main contributing factors to their return. However, the airstrikes resumed on 28 January which may lead to another displacement. In Kayin State, about 2,100 people also returned to Hpa Lu area. Despite the returns, large displacements were also verified with 7,900 people displaced from Loikaw and Demoso to Shan South (Hsihseng and Pekon Township, but also to Kayin State (mainly to Thandaunggyi Township). In Tanintharyi Region, approximately 1,000 people left from at least seven villages of Dawei, Thayetchaung and Yebyu Townships following the intensified clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces/MAF and local People’s Defence Forces.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-south-east-monthly-displacement-snapshot-trend-people-displaced-south-east-4

160 000 people helped, February 1, 2022 marks the first anniversary of the coup in Myanmar. On this occasion, Jean-Loup Gouot, Country Director of SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL, gives an alarming overview of the situation and the challenges that the population has to face on a daily basis, in a context in which international funding is struggling to meet the growing humanitarian needs., 6.2 million people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance in Myanmar: these are the figures revealed by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) on December 31, 2021. A year earlier, the figure was nearly one million. We are therefore dealing with a massive explosion of needs, whether in regards access to food, drinking water, sanitation, hygiene, health, or education., This dramatic situation is the result of the political and economic crisis following the COVID-19 pandemic and the overthrow of the civilian authorities on February 1, 2021. While rampant inflation makes essential goods increasingly difficult to access, tensions and violence in the country are causing large-scale population displacement and exposing hundreds of thousands of people to extreme vulnerability., n addition, the humanitarian conditions have worsened for populations and ethnic minorities that were already in great difficulty. For instance, the Rohingya community, which has been displaced for nearly ten years, is in a particularly dire situation., Faced with this catastrophic scenario, humanitarian actors and donors must respond to emerging needs while continuing to address pre-existing needs in a difficult operational context and with significant access restrictions., In the Pauktaw IDP camps in Arakan State alone, where more than 20,000 Rohingya live, SOLIDARITÉS INTERNATIONAL has yet to secure the $2,700,000 needed to ensure the quality and quantity of access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene for the population for the coming year. These resources would allow the NGO to continue to address the logistical challenges of bringing clean water by boat to this remote area, cleaning sewage systems, and promoting good hygiene (which is especially critical during the pandemic)., If the organization is not able to raise the necessary funds, and as Myanmar enters a period of drought and begins to record its first cases of the Omicron variant, we could quickly be faced with a major health crisis, the spread of COVID-19, andalso that of waterborne diseases (e.g., cholera, acute watery diarrhea). These risks are all the more worrying for people living in IDP camps as their freedom of movement is often restricted and they are in areas highly exposed to natural disasters., The contribution of all and a mobilization of funding efforts to support the deployment of humanitarian aid is urgent and indispensable.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-needs-explode

These include 226,400 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in South-East Myanmar – 91,900 in Kayah State, 51,800 in Shan State (South-all towns except Kyethi, Laihka and Mongkaing), 71,800 in Kayin State, 7,500 in Mon State, 2,600 in Tanintharyi Region and 800 in Bago Region and 6,900 in Shan State (North). In addition, there are 146,500 IDPs in Sagaing Region, 34,000 in Chin State and 21,400 in Magway Region., In the South-East, smaller-scale displacement continues while returns of internally displaced persons to their place of origin have been reported from Shan State (South) to Kayah State in areas where fewer clashes occurred in the past few weeks. IDPs have also been prompted to return due to the lack of shelter, food, water and winter items in displacement areas. During the first week of February, for the first time since the beginning of the year, some 400 individuals have been newly displaced within Kyaikto Township, Mon State. The cause of displacement is linked to the intensification of clashes in Hpapun Township, Kayin State and northern Mon State. Amidst the surge in COVID-19 cases across the country, IDPs have also reportedly been infected, including in Loikaw, Kayah State., In the North-West, armed clashes continue to displace families. There was a significant increase in displacement in the Sagaing Region in comparison to previous weeks with some 10,000 persons newly displaced. Many IDPs are in need of shelter, though displacement remains fluid, with civilians often displaced to nearby mountains or forests for short periods of time. Homes continue to be destroyed throughout the region, hindering return and exacerbating shelter and protection needs., In Rakhine State, curfews were observed in some townships such as Maungdaw, Buthidaung,
Mrauk-U, Minbya, and Kyautaw. Acute water diarrhoea (AWD) – affecting mostly children – continues to be reported in IDP camps, villages, and displacement sites. Timely treatment is hampered by inadequate health care and WASH facilities, movement constraints, systemic discrimination, segregation and hence reliance on traditional healers.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-emergency-update-15-february-2022
Diaspora Organizations and their Humanitarian Response in Myanmar,Analysis,DEMAC,Coordination,21 Feb 2022,"This Real-Time Report is part of the Diaspora Emergency Action & Coordination Initiative (DEMAC) ""Research study on diaspora humanitarian response and engagement""., The Real-Time Report investigates from November 2021 - January 2022 how Myanmar diaspora organizations engage with the current crisis in Myanmar, how they mobilize funding, what their advocacies are and who they partner or coordinate with on the ground to support the people most in need of humanitarian assistance., DEMAC, together with external consultants, undertook an initial rapid review to map the structures and activities of 30 diaspora organizations involved in the response. Semi-structured interviews with 21 people representing diaspora organizations, international humanitarian organizations and people affected by the crisis were conducted. Social media posts from the Facebook accounts of 30 diaspora organizations were also monitored over a six-week period., The Myanmar Context, In February 2021, the Myanmar military, the Tatmadaw, seized power through brutally repressing the population, resulting in a “deep human rights, humanitarian, and economic crisis”. The crisis is compounded by deepening economic recession, the global pandemic, health system collapse, and surging poverty and food insecurity., As of 6 December 2021, this crisis had already displaced 284,700 people across Myanmar. A further 25,000 refugees have been displaced to neighboring countries. The UN has documented over 1,000 civilians killed and 8,000 arbitrarily detained. Many have been tortured—including children., The Diaspora – Lifelines to Myanmar, Myanmar has an extensive, active, and committed diaspora. The type of support prioritized is independent of international aid categories of humanitarian assistance, human rights, protection or direct support for politics and civil disobedience. Their activities are largely in parallel and separate to the existing humanitarian architecture. The diaspora is mainly engaged in activities such as fundraising, advocacy, education, settlement assistance and documentation of human rights abuses., As of 2021, over 3 million Myanmar nationals have migrated internationally, primarily to Thailand, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Close to 2 million Myanmar nationals live in neighboring Thailand, the largest destination for Burmese migrants., Key challenges for Myanmar Diasporas, Unsurprisingly, the key challenges for diaspora organizations are funding and resources, as well as access. Many organizations operate on a voluntary basis, necessarily limiting the time available from their members. For diaspora organizations supporting the civil disobedience movement, providing support can be particularly dangerous, especially when using Hundi and communicating through underground networks., Recognition by the International Humanitarian Community, The international humanitarian community recognizes the unique value offered by diaspora organizations—their reach in areas inaccessible to international actors, access to real-time information and people, some of whom may move regularly, and ability to act informally and relatively quickly, unrestrained by formal bureaucracy. They have an ability to meet needs that are impossible for the international community to address., Find out more on demac.org or directly here https://bit.ly/3I0pTK3",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/diaspora-organizations-and-their-humanitarian-response-myanmar

"Atrocity Alert No. 288: Myanmar (Burma), Ukraine and China",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,16 Feb 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., THOUSANDS DISPLACED AS VIOLENCE ESCALATES ACROSS MYANMAR, Since 31 January Myanmar’s (Burma) military – the Tatmadaw – has burned down more than 1,500 homes in northwest Sagaing Region’s Pale and Mingin townships, resulting in civilian casualties and mass displacement. In a span of 10 days in January, the military killed at least 38 civilians in Sagaing Region, including women and children. Over 10,000 civilians have been forced to flee Mingin Township so far. The recent offensives appear to have been in retaliation over assaults by the local People’s Defence Force (PDF), civilian militias formed as part of an armed resistance against the junta. The series of arson attacks are the latest in the Tatmadaw’s ongoing large-scale offensive and scorched-earth campaign that began in November in northwestern Myanmar., Widespread and systematic violence is also intensifying elsewhere in Myanmar. A new report by the nongovernmental human rights organization, Fortify Rights, released on 15 February, provides evidence of likely war crimes perpetrated by the military in southeastern Kayah (Karenni) State, including the killing of at least 61 civilians and the use of others as human shields. Fortify Rights also documented attacks on churches, residential homes, displacement sites and other non-military targets between May 2021 and January 2022. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, between the 1 February 2021 military coup and 31 January 2022, more than 3,500 houses, churches, monasteries, schools and markets had been either burnt down or destroyed in Chin and Kayah states and Sagaing and Magway regions., The escalating conflict in northwestern and southeastern Myanmar has triggered waves of mass displacement. On 11 February the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) announced that since the military coup, an estimated 440,000 people have been forced to flee as a result of airstrikes, shelling and the burning of villages, bringing the total number of internally displaced people (IDPs) to over 800,000. UNHCR Spokesperson, Matthew Saltmarsh, warned that, “security is deteriorating rapidly across the country as fighting and armed conflict intensifies with no sign of abating. UNHCR forecasts an accelerating trend of displacements in the coming weeks and months.”, The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) must do more to respond to the escalating crisis in Myanmar and prevent a regional refugee crisis. Myanmar’s neighbors have a responsibility to give temporary protection to people fleeing violence and atrocities, and to refrain from returning them to Myanmar. The UN Security Council must immediately impose a global arms embargo on Myanmar’s military, and ASEAN should support it. UN member states, and in particular ASEAN member states, must sanction Myanmar’s oil and gas sector to protect civilians from further atrocities., UKRAINE TENSIONS REACH TIPPING POINT, INCREASING RISKS FOR CIVILIANS, On 14 February UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that “the time is now” to defuse tensions between Russia and Ukraine and its allies amid warnings that war could be imminent. Secretary-General Guterres stressed that, “the price in human suffering, destruction and damage to European and global security is too high to contemplate,” and reminded the international community that “there is no place for incendiary rhetoric. Public statements should aim to reduce tensions, not inflame them.”, Since fall 2021 tensions have been on the rise due to Russia’s troop build-up near Ukraine’s border. Approximately 150,000 Russian troops and equipment have been deployed to Ukraine’s western, southwestern and northern borders. Despite this mobilization, Russia has denied any plans to invade the country. The United States and other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have insisted on de-escalation., This dramatic escalation is the latest evolution in a conflict that has been ongoing since 2014, when anti-government protests evolved into a Russian-backed separatist movement that seized parts of the eastern provinces of Ukraine – Donetsk and Luhansk – an area collectively called Donbas. In February 2014 Ukraine’s President Viktor Yanukovych was removed from power by a parliament vote – a move that Russia perceived as a Western-backed overthrow. Russia subsequently annexed the Crimean Peninsula in March 2014. The UN General Assembly has deemed this annexation illegal and invalid under international law. The crisis is rooted in Ukraine’s desire to join NATO and to deepen ties with its European neighbors, which Russia views as a “red line” and direct threat to its security., Since 2014, several rounds of peace negotiations have failed to achieve a long-standing solution and civilians have continued to bear the brunt of conflict. At least 3,393 civilians have been killed, with over 7,000 people injured thus far. Approximately 2 million people live in a 20-kilometer zone on both sides of the stalemated “line of contact,” or line of separation, in Donbas and would be under increased risk of violence and displacement if the conflict escalates. Donbas is also one of the world’s most heavily mine-contaminated areas, including landmines and explosive remnants of war which pose significant threats to civilians’ physical and socioeconomic wellbeing. Currently 2.9 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance and at least 1.4 million are internally displaced., International human rights organizations have documented alleged atrocity crimes committed by all sides since 2014, including the indiscriminate shelling of civilian areas, as well as armed groups using arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, torture and sexual violence in areas under their control. These acts may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity., Savita Pawnday, Executive Director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, joined those urging calm, emphasizing that, “an escalation of hostilities in Ukraine would have a detrimental impact on civilians across the region. All parties involved, including Ukraine, Russia and NATO-members, must commit to de-escalation for the sake of civilians in Donbas and beyond. Their lives should not be pawns for geopolitical gain.”, UN AGENCY NOTES “DEEP CONCERN” ABOUT WORKING CONDITIONS FACING UYGHURS IN CHINA, On 11 February a Committee of Experts from the United Nation’s International Labour Organization (ILO) released its annual report in which it expressed concern about the working conditions facing Uyghurs and other Muslim-majority ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and throughout China. Speaking to Reuters, an ILO official said the alleged violations would be raised at the International Labour Conference in June, which could lead to a formal complaint and the creation of a commission of inquiry to investigate abuses. Uyghur forced labor is well-documented and likely constitutes crimes against humanity; however, this report is significant because it is a rare instance of a UN agency criticizing China’s human rights abuses., Under the false claims of combatting religious extremism, the Chinese government in recent years has detained more than 1 million Uyghurs and members of other majority-Muslim ethnic groups in “re-education” or “de-extremification” camps, where they are then often forcibly transferred to factories in XUAR and across China to work under conditions of forced labor. Reports estimate approximately 100,000 Uyghurs in XUAR are working under conditions that strongly suggest forced labor. The ILO experts expressed concern about the forced relocation of workers, namely Uyghurs, across China, and raised doubts about the validity of China’s claims that its policies in the region are for counterterrorism purposes., According to the report, “the employment situation of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in China provides numerous indications of coercive measures, many of which arise from regulatory and policy documents.” The committee asked the Chinese government to repeal provisions “that impose de-radicalisation duties on enterprises and trade unions” in XUAR and to “review its national and regional policies with a view to eliminating all distinction, exclusion or preference” against Uyghurs and other ethnic groups in XUAR., The release of the ILO report comes amid increasing calls for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, to publicly release her office’s report on human rights in XUAR. In September 2021 High Commissioner Bachelet announced her office was finalizing its report on human rights in XUAR., Liam Scott, Research Associate at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “the Chinese government should heed the recommendations of the ILO experts and immediately halt its widespread and systematic practice of Uyghur forced labor. All UN member states should ban goods produced with forced labor of Uyghurs and other ethnic groups in China. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights should publish its report on XUAR before the upcoming 49th regular session of the Human Rights Council.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-288-myanmar-burma-ukraine-and-china

Myanmar South East - Monthly Displacement Snapshot: Trend of people displaced in South East since Feb 2021 and remain displaced (as of 31 Jan 2022),Infographic,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,31 Jan 2022,"In January 2022, the number of new IDPs have significantly increased with a total of 85,000 new verified IDPs., Early January in the South-East, 21,300 people were displaced from Kayin State in the Lay Kay Kaw area of Myawaddy Township, following Tatmadaw airstrikes and clashes between security forces and a combined force of the Karen National Union (KNU) and People’s Defence Force (PDF)., In the second week, due to indiscriminative shelling and armed clashes about 15,200 people were displaced to Kayah, Kayin and Shan (South) states and Tanintharyi Region, in addition to some 890 people estimated to have fled to Thailand. In total, some 2,800 people remained on the Thai side of the border in early January. With the conflict intensifying in Kayah state, the number of new IDPs in Shan State (South) increased with 6,130 individuals were displaced from Pekon town and nearby communities due to continued clashes between the Tatmadaw and local resistance groups, seeking safety at various villages and locations further in Pekon Township. Furthermore, over 2,200 people were displaced to Mongkaing town between in January due to inter-EAO conflict between the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS) and Shan State Progress Party (SSPP)., The third week was not different as the number of displaced people continued to increase with 17,712 newly displaced individuals. The main hosting area for new IDPs remained Taunggyi and its surrounding townships in Shan (South) State with 15,238 new IDPs. Furthermore, the conflict within Kayah State had brought about 2,125 newly displaced to Demoso, Hpruso and South Pekon. However, the continuous airstrikes and clashes in many parts of the SE had led to secondary displacements to safer locations with better access to services and assistance. In Kayin State, clashes intensified in Myawaddy, Kawkareik and Hpapun townships with shelling and airstrikes as well as attacks on the roads. 186 people displaced towards Hpa-an and Hpapun, most of them as secondary displacements., During the fourth week, the number of displaced people continued to increase with 19,765 new IDPs, which brought the total number to stand at 237,700. This figure included 237,100 IDPs in Kayah, Kayin, Shan (South) States and Bago East and Tanintharyi Region. In addition, it is estimated that 600 people remained on the Thai side of the border but spontaneous and/or forced returns occurred during the week. The reception area for new IDPs continued to be Taunggyi and its surrounding townships in Shan (South) State with 10,000 new people displaced. In Kayah State while the number has decreased compared to the previous week, airstrikes by the Tatmadaw had been reportedly taking place in Hpruso, Demoso and Loikaw impacting civilians. In Kayin State, clashes heavily intensified in Myawaddy, Kawkareik and Hpapun townships with shelling and airstrikes as well as attacks on the roads. The situation is worsening in the area with a significant increase of IDPs., Toward the end of January, the total number of IDPs had slightly decreased compared to the previous weeks, a total of 232,600 people were displaced, including an estimated of 600 people still remaining in the Thai border. The decrease is due to the return of about 5,900 people from South Shan to Pekon Township. In this area the conflict has temporarily ceased allowing people to return. The cold weather, lack of shelter, lack of proper clothing, lack of water and food should are considered as the main contributing factors to their return. However, the airstrikes resumed on 28 January which may lead to another displacement. In Kayin State, about 2,100 people also returned to Hpa Lu area., Despite the returns, large displacements were also veriifed with 7,900 people displaced from Loikaw and Demoso to Shan South (Hsihseng and Pekon Township, but also to Kayin State (mainly to Thandaunggyi Township). In Tanintharyi Region, approximately 1,000 people left from at least seven villages of Dawei, Thayetchaung and Yebyu Townships following the intensified clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces/MAF and local People’s Defence Forces.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-south-east-monthly-displacement-snapshot-trend-people-displaced-south-east-3

So far, 100 new IDPs were verified in Du Yin Pin Shaung village, UNHCR partners are still collecting information and the final number is expected to be higher., In Shan State (South), 2,345 newly IDPs were verified this week in Nyaung Shwe and Pinlaung Townships. However, the IDPs have displaced since January from Kayah but the figures could not be verified before., Temporary returns to the villages of origin continue to take place but the IDP returnee often have to displace again due to the lack of insecurity. This was the case in Kone Thar village in Loikaw township where 200 IDPs who moved back to Khone Thar few weeks ago but displaced again into the jungle after heavy clashes during the week., 30 individuals from Pindaya and 70 individuals established in Nyaung Shwe township returned to Loikaw in the less conflictive areas of the town.

This is in addition to the 370,400 people living in protracted displacement before February 2021., Humanitarian actors have continued providing critical life-saving assistance to displaced people and host communities wherever they can, including through local partners amid serious access challenges., Preparedness efforts to contain the fourth wave of COVID-19 are ongoing. These include surveillance, case management, infection prevention and control, and Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE)., An outbreak of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) has been reported in displacement sites hosting those affected by Arakan Army (AA)-Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) conflict and in Rohingya IDP camps in three townships in Rakhine State. Humanitarian partners have collectively intervened to contain the outbreak and continue monitoring the situation., In January, UNOCHA released the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), which requests US$826 million to reach 6.2 million people in need of life-saving humanitarian support., KEY FIGURES *, 441K

Civilian properties, including houses, churches, monasteries and schools burnt down or destroyed since February 2021., **Displacement figures fluctuate during any given month. These figures represent the number of people currently displaced. Cumulative numbers for returns and displacement are not always available., SITUATION OVERVIEW, A year on from the 1 February 2021 military takeover, the security, humanitarian and human rights situation in Myanmar continues to be dominated by intensified hostilities between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and various ethnic armed organizations (EAOs), as well as People’s Defence Forces (PDFs) across multiple states and regions, with no respite on the horizon. Heightened conflict during January saw loss of civilian lives, destruction of homes and livelihoods, and a surge in internal and cross-border displacement., Protection of civilians and threats to basic rights remain a grave concern for the humanitarian community among escalating tensions. According to OHCHR, the violence that has ensued and spread across the country since February 2021 has claimed the lives of at least 1,500 people, including men, women, boys and girls, and many have been injured or maimed. Of the total, more than 114 were children under 18 years old, including at least 18 children in January alone. Furthermore, between 1 January and 31 December 2021, UNICEF reports that 169 landmine and explosive remnant of war (ERW) incidents in which 88 civilians, including 19 women and 19 children, were killed and another 196 people, including 33 women and 55 children, were injured., A year of unprecedented violence has driven desperate need in new areas and has further compounded the humanitarian situation for those already displaced and suffering. According to UNHCR,4 441,500 people remain internally displaced across the country due to violence and insecurity since February 2021. This recent displacement has already exceeded the number of displaced people in Rakhine, Chin, Shan and Kachin states from conflicts prior to the military takeover (370,400 IDPs). As of 31 January 2022, more than 3,500 houses, churches, monasteries, schools, and markets had been either burnt down or destroyed, mainly in Chin and Kayah states and Sagaing and Magway regions. The humanitarian needs of displaced people as well as host communities are escalating and include food, shelter and relief items, as well as access to life-saving services, including health and education. As a result of conflict and the political crisis, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, poverty has surged. UNDP projects that nearly half of Myanmar’s 54 million people – some 25 million people – are in poverty heading into 2022. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that in 2021, only 18.9 million women and men were employed, which is 1.6 million (8 per cent) fewer than in 2020.6 Food insecurity is rising because of increasing poverty. More than 13 million people are now in moderate or severe food insecurity across the country with concerning implications for malnutrition in 2022., In January, on behalf of the humanitarian community in Myanmar, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), published the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), which requests US$826 million for UN agencies, international and local NGOs to reach 6.2 million people in need of life-saving humanitarian support., Humanitarians need to be able to physically get help to people in need. Access is currently extremely limited and bureaucratic, delaying the delivery of assistance and prolonging people’s suffering. As recently noted by the Spokesperson of the UN Secretary-General, the “multiple vulnerabilities of all people across Myanmar and its regional implications require an urgent response. Access to people in need is critically important for the United Nations and partners to continue to deliver on the ground.” He also added that “[a]rmed forces and all stakeholders must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.”, Quicker, simplified and predictable access processes and assurances of aid worker safety are urgently needed for a humanitarian response of this size, allowing local, national and international organizations to support people in need. Visa, banking, registration and MOU blockages remain major obstacles to effective response and must urgently be resolved., Donors are urged to give generously, in solidarity with the people of Myanmar to save lives and protect hard-fought development gains while there is still a window to do so. Identifying and engaging additional local partners will also be critical to delivering more assistance to more people in hard-to-reach and under-served locations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-humanitarian-update-no-15-15-february-2022
Developments in Gambia’s Case Against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice: Questions and Answers,Analysis,HRW,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",14 Feb 2022,"Myanmar: Rohingya Genocide Case Steps Toward Justice, Q&A Explores World Court Scrutiny of Military Atrocities, (The Hague) -- International Court of Justice (ICJ) hearings beginning February 21, 2022 underline the critical importance of bringing justice for the Myanmar military's abuses against ethnic Rohingya, Human Rights Watch and the Global Justice Center said today. The groups released a question-and-answer document outlining recent developments in the case, including the impact of the February 1, 2021 military coup in Myanmar, on the ICJ proceedings., The hearings at the court from February 21 to 28 are for the case brought by Gambia against Myanmar alleging that the military's atrocities in Rakhine State against Rohingya Muslims violate the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Genocide Convention)., ""The International Court of Justice hearings are the next step in the landmark case to break the cycle of violence and impunity in Myanmar,"" said Nushin Sarkarati, associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch. ""The case could build a pathway to justice, not only for the Rohingya, but for everyone in the country."", In November 2019, Gambia filed a case before the ICJ alleging that Myanmar's atrocities against the Rohingya in Rakhine State violate various provisions of the Genocide Convention. The case before the ICJ is not a criminal case against individual alleged perpetrators, but a legal determination of state responsibility for genocide., The ICJ held hearings in December 2019, on Gambia's request, for provisional measures to protect the Rohingya remaining in Myanmar from genocide, which the court unanimously adopted in January 2020. The new hearings will cover Myanmar's preliminary objections to the case, which challenge the court's jurisdiction and Gambia's legal standing to file the case., The court's provisional measures require Myanmar to prevent all genocidal acts against the Rohingya, to ensure that security forces do not commit acts of genocide, and to take steps to preserve evidence related to the case. Myanmar is legally bound to comply with this order. However, Human Rights Watch and others have documented ongoing grave abuses against the 600,000 Rohingya remaining in Myanmar, contravening the provisional measures ordered by the court., Since the February 2001 coup, junta security forces have carried out mass killings, torture, sexual violence, arbitrary arrests, and other abuses that Human Rights Watch believes amount to crimes against humanity. Security forces have killed over 1,500 people since the coup, including at least 100 children, and arbitrarily detained over 11,000 activists, politicians, journalists, and others. Rohingya have also faced even greater movement restrictions and harsher punishments for attempting to leave Rakhine State, which amount to the crimes against humanity of persecution, apartheid, and severe deprivation of liberty., In 2019, Myanmar's government appointed State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi to lead its delegation to the ICJ. During the 2021 coup, the military arrested Aung San Suu Kyi and a junta-controlled court sentenced her to six years in prison. She still faces over 150 years in prison combined on various additional fabricated charges. On June 24, 2021, the junta announced that it appointed a panel of eight senior junta officials to represent Myanmar's delegation before the court., During the February hearings, representatives of Myanmar and Gambia will present arguments as to whether the ICJ has jurisdiction to examine the genocide claims against Myanmar. The hearings will take place in a hybrid format, including both in-person and virtual participants. Live streaming of the hearings will be available in English and French on the court's website and on UN Web TV., While the ICJ case focuses exclusively on alleged crimes against the Rohingya, the military has committed brutal abuses across Myanmar. In the wake of the coup, ethnic groups have sought greater solidarity in the pursuit of justice, as the military's atrocities against the Rohingya have been echoed in attacks on civilians around the country. The ICJ case could set the stage to scrutinize the Myanmar military's longstanding international crimes more widely, Human Rights Watch and the Global Justice Center said., ""As the Myanmar military continues to commit atrocities against anti-coup protesters and ethnic minorities, it should be put on notice there will be consequences for these actions -- past, present, and future,"" said Akila Radhakrishnan, president of the Global Justice Center. ""The ICJ's proceedings are laying the groundwork for accountability in Myanmar -- not only for the Rohingya, but for all others who have suffered at the hands of the military.""",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/developments-gambia-s-case-against-myanmar-international-court-justice-questions-and
Displaced families in crisis-hit Myanmar struggle for survival,News and Press Release,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,11 Feb 2022,"Displaced families in crisis-hit Myanmar struggle for survival, By Reuben Lim Wende and Yin Yin Myint in Myanmar, Anna Ruth* vividly remembers the day her husband was killed as the family tried to escape gunfire for the second time in less than a year., When fighting between the Myanmar Armed Forces and other armed groups reached the village they had sought refuge in near Loikaw, the capital of Myanmar’s south-eastern Kayah State, she and her family fled with other villagers to the nearby forest to hide. But her husband and some of their neighbours wanted to go back to gather food and other essentials., “I told him not to go because it was too dangerous, but he didn’t listen,” she recalls. “In the evening, the group returned but my husband did not. I later found out that he was shot while collecting some belongings from my mother-in-law’s house where we had been sheltering.”, In Kayah State, a humanitarian crisis has been building since renewed armed conflict broke out in May 2021. With six of the state’s seven townships now affected by intense fighting, tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes. Some have sought safety at places of worship and community centres, while others are hiding in the jungle., Across Myanmar, similar patterns have been playing out of clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces, ethnic and other local armed groups, followed by waves of fresh displacement. Since the military takeover on 1 February 2021, some 440,000 people have been forced to flee airstrikes, shelling, and burning of villages, more than half of them in the south-east of the country, with Kayah and Kayin States the worst affected., Anna Ruth and her family, like many others in Kayah State, have been displaced several times. “We have been running since June 2021,” she explains. “First from our village in Demoso Township to my mother-in-law’s in Loikaw Township, and from there to the forest where we stayed for months.”, Left widowed with four young children, she eventually sought safety in another village in Loikaw Township, only to be displaced again a few weeks later when fighting intensified across Kayah State last month. Desperate for safety and unsure where to go next, Anna Ruth followed other displaced families and crossed into neighbouring Shan State., “I’ve lost everything except my children.”, “I never imagined that this would happen to me. Before, my family was living happily in our village. Now, I’ve lost everything except my children,” she said., They are now sheltering at a monastery where, in scenes repeated across Myanmar, the local community and local charities are showing solidarity and leading the humanitarian response. Despite their best efforts, resources are increasingly stretched as more displaced people arrive., UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has been working with local partners and communities to relieve some of this pressure and supplement grassroots aid efforts to assist some 30,000 people who have arrived to Shan State from Kayah State since the beginning of the year. The agency has set up a temporary base in the Shan State capital, Taunggyi, to coordinate distribution of emergency aid in the area and address shortages of basic household materials and clothing., Over the past few weeks, some 10,000 internally displaced people from Kayah, spread across several townships in Shan State, have received blankets, kitchen sets, mosquito nets, jerry cans, buckets, sleeping mats, tarpaulins, and winterization kits. Local well-wishers have also contributed items such as toothbrushes, soap, and shampoo., Having arrived with few possessions, Anna Ruth is grateful for the help. “At first, we were unsure about taking shelter at the Buddhist monastery as we are Christians,” she explained. “But the monks warmly welcomed all of us. Now, we live together with other displaced people in harmony. The blankets, buckets, mats and clothing provided are very helpful for us as I was only able to bring some of my children’s clothing with me.”, With the ongoing conflict in Kayah State showing no sign of abating, further displacement towards Shan State is expected in the weeks, and even months to come., While relieved to have found a place of refuge, Anna Ruth yearns to return to her native Kayah State. “My children keep asking when they can go back home. We hope we can return soon.”, *Names changed for protection reasons.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/displaced-families-crisis-hit-myanmar-struggle-survival
UNHCR steps up aid for displaced in Myanmar as conflict intensifies,News and Press Release,UNHCR,"Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",11 Feb 2022,"This is a summary of what was said by UNHCR spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva., UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is stepping up its emergency response to assist hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people (IDPs) in Myanmar as their number crossed the 800,000 mark – doubling since February 2021., Security is deteriorating rapidly across the country as fighting and armed conflict intensifies with no sign of abating., UNHCR forecasts an accelerating trend of displacements in the coming weeks and months., Some 440,000 people have been newly displaced since February 2021, according to UNHCR data, adding to an existing 370,000 who had fled their homes previously., UNHCR and partners are scaling up operations and deploying additional resources to support as many of the displaced as possible, complementing local community responses., In the South-East of the country, Kayin, Kayah, Mon and Shan (South) states as well as Bago (East) and Tanintharyi regions collectively account for more than half of the 440,000 newly displaced civilians. Kayin and Kayah states remain the most affected as hostilities between various armed groups have triggered large-scale displacements., Another conflict-affected area with pressing humanitarian needs is Myanmar’s North-West, where about 190,000 people remain displaced in Chin State, Magway Region and Sagaing Region., Humanitarian access in many parts of Myanmar remains restricted due to insecurity, roadblocks and challenges in obtaining access approvals. As a result, host communities and local responders continue to play a leading role in assisting displaced populations – demonstrating solidarity with each other by donating what they can., UNHCR has been working with UN agencies, local partners and communities to assist those affected wherever possible, including displaced and stateless populations and host communities. In 2021, UNHCR’s emergency relief assistance reached some 170,000 individuals in nine states and regions in Myanmar., In all locations, UNHCR and partners distributed relief items including tarpaulins, ropes, blankets, kitchen sets, mosquito nets, buckets, sleeping mats, sanitary kits, COVID-19 personal protective equipment, solar lamps, and winterization kits for adults and children., In Shan State, where a growing number of IDPs have arrived from conflict-affected Kayah State since the start of 2022, UNHCR recently established a temporary base in Taunggyi to coordinate distribution of emergency aid with partners., Provision of relief items to Kayah IDPs in and around Taunggyi started in mid-January and quickly expanded to incorporate neighbouring townships. Within a month, UNHCR and partners were able to reach some 10,000 IDPs in Shan as well as 2,000 in Kayah., The humanitarian situation in Myanmar remains precarious with increased vulnerabilities linked to rising commodity prices, job and income losses, disruptions to basic services and prolonged insecurity. The majority of IDPs are consequently dependent on humanitarian support for survival., Some 600,000 stateless Rohingya in Rakhine State, including some 148,000 displaced in camps, villages and displacement sites, also remain highly vulnerable and require humanitarian support., Despite operational challenges, UNHCR continues to stay and deliver in Myanmar. The agency remains committed to providing critical humanitarian assistance to those in need and calls for full, safe and unhindered humanitarian access across Myanmar, so that no disruption to lifesaving work occurs for local, national, and international aid agencies., In 2022, UNHCR will respond to the ongoing crisis by expanding its protection and operational presence where new displacements have occurred. A total of US$56.7 million is needed to ensure adequate humanitarian assistance and support vulnerable communities., Our priority will be on maintaining basic safeguards, advocacy for improved access to fundamental rights, mitigating the risk of negative coping strategies, preventing forced returns and building resilience for over 1.2 million IDPs and stateless people in Myanmar., For more information on this topic, please contact:, In Yangon, Reuben Lim Wende, wende@unhcr.org In Bangkok, Kasita Rochanakorn, rochanak@unhcr.org, +66 64 932 0803 In Geneva, Matthew Saltmarsh, saltmars@unhcr.org, +41 79 967 9936 In New York, Kathryn Mahoney, mahoney@unhcr.org, +1 347 443 7646",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unhcr-steps-aid-displaced-myanmar-conflict-intensifies

In total, 15,168,274 positive cases and 312,408 deaths have been confirmed in the region, with Indonesia (4.26 million cases), Philippines (2.84 million cases), Malaysia (2.75 million cases) and Thailand (2.22 million cases) being the most affected., An additional 601 children aged 6 to 59 months were provided with treatment for severe acute malnutrition and 1.7 million children and adolescents with messages on healthy diets. UNICEF also provided 18.3 million children and adolescents with messages on healthy diets., UNICEF supported 188,970 schools to implement safe school protocols and 34 million children with access to formal or non-formal education, including early learning., Situation in Numbers, 15,168,274 confirmed COVID-19 cases and, 312,408 deaths, 1,711,350 additional children with SAM due to COVID-19, 6.9 million children are not immunized against measles, 369 million people lack access to basic hygiene services, 144 million children/adolescents lack access to education, Regional Funding Overview, In 2021, UNICEF appealed for US$ 117.2 million to meet the humanitarian needs of children, adolescents and women affected by emergencies, including chronic, protracted humanitarian situations as well as UNICEF’s response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region. So far, a total of US$ 98.5 million has been received against the 2021 HAC (including US$ 33.8 million carried over from 2020 and US$ 64.7 received in 20211 from donors, including the Governments of Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States of America, European Commission, Asian Development Bank, World Bank, CERF, Global Partnership for Education, Gavi, Solidarity Fund, United Nations Office for South South Cooperation, several private donors and UNICEF committees in Australia, Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland, Thailand, and the USA. UNICEF acknowledges the generous contribution of donors including private sectors supporting this joint effort to respond and mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and other emergencies in the EAP region. Please refer to Annex B and Annex C for more detailed information on funding per functional area and country., In addition, UNICEF has received US$90.7 million for COVID-19 vaccine roll-out in East Asia and Pacific for 2021 in response to the Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A)/COVAX appeal. The ACT-A / COVAX HAC appeal which was launched and is managed globally complements the EAP Regional HAC appeal by supporting country readiness for COVID-19 vaccine roll out, together with WHO and Gavi, while supporting the strengthening of health systems. This includes providing commodities needed for safe vaccine administration, such as cold chain equipment, personal protective equipment (PPE), and hand hygiene (soap and hand sanitizer), operational costs for vaccine delivery and associated technical assistance. Crucially, this also includes support for vaccine delivery to humanitarian populations. The seven support areas are in alignment with the categories of National Deployment and Vaccination Plans and include: planning and coordination, prioritization and targeting, service delivery, training, monitoring and evaluation, vaccine cold-chain and logistics, communication and community engagement. Funding and results from the ACT-A / COVAX HAC appeal are reported through a separate global ACTA situation report., Regional Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, Driven by the Omicron variant, the number of confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19 in EAP continued to rise during the reporting period. Since the start of the pandemic, 15.2 million positive cases and 312,408 deaths have been confirmed in the region, with Indonesia (4.3 million cases), Philippines (2.8 million cases), Malaysia (2.7 million cases) and Thailand (2.2 million cases) being the most affected. Countries across the region continued to vaccinate their populations against COVID-19. Nevertheless, the pandemic and related control measures including movement restrictions continue to disrupt access to essential health, nutrition, and social services and to drive steep declines in household incomes. The detection of the Omicron variant across the region alerted countries to tighten border control and reimpose restrictions and preventive measures. The prices of food and daily commodities have also increased, with many households struggling with unemployment and loss of income due to the persistent pandemic situation., A combined approach of supporting vaccine roll-out while continuing to focus on efforts to contain the spread of the virus and respond to the social-economic impacts of the pandemic remains critical to save lives and alleviate suffering, especially for children. According to UNICEF’s latest regional report on child nutrition, overall household incomes and a reduction in the availability and accessibility of nutritious foods led to a shift in many families' lifestyles and dietary habits as well as rises in both overweight and undernutrition are predicted. Access to health and nutrition services were severely disrupted multiple times over successive waves of pandemic-related lockdowns., As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it becomes ever more urgent to ensure delivery of safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services. Across the region, 89 million people do not have basic handwashing facilities with soap and water at home4 . More than half of the schools in the region did not have hand-washing facilities with soap and water available to students, and more than 6 out of 10 health care facilities in East Asia and Pacific lacked functional handwashing facilities with soap and water or hand sanitizer. Therefore, increasing handwashing with soap in all settings while improving WASH access through direct provision of supplies and strengthening systems for services remained an important response strategy., Rising COVID-19 cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant in late 2021 meant a slow reopening of schools across the region. As of 31 December 2021, schools in the East Asia and Pacific region were fully open in seventeen countries (China, Cook Islands, DPRK, Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tokelau, Tonga and Vanuatu), and partially open in another nine (Cambodia, Fiji, Indonesia, Laos PDR, Malaysia, Mongolia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam). Following one of the longest school closures in the world, the Philippines have reopened 256 schools (less than 1% of the total) as a pilot test for a future broader reopening process. However, the school reopening plans were disrupted in areas hit by Super Typhoon Rai (locally known as Odette) in December 2021. Meanwhile, remote learning options, including blended learning, remain in place in most of the countries across the region.  , The adverse socio-economic impact of the pandemic continues to drive millions of children into extreme destitution and livelihood insecurity. As the third and strongest wave of COVID-19 in the region continued to spread in the last quarter of 2021, several EAP countries adjusted the duration of some social protection schemes accordingly, and/or erected new programmes to protect livelihoods during this period after previous temporary schemes were ceased., Across the region, recurring natural disasters, including those induced by climate crises, continued to constrain the socio-economic recovery from the pandemic. Typhoon Rai, which swept through the Philippines on 16 December, further exacerbated the vulnerability of children and their families who have already been struggling to cope with the devastating consequences of COVID-19. In Myanmar, the continuing armed conflict and targeted violence, coupled with the presence of COVID-19, is pushing a growing number of children into a situation of humanitarian needs. Further details on the situation in the Philippines and Myanmar can be found in separate situation reports dedicated to their respective UNICEF HAC appeals.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-east-asia-and-pacific-region-humanitarian-situation-report-no-4-1-october-31

Several factors explain such decrease. Firstly, in Kayin State, 9505 IDPs returned from the Thai-Myanmar border to their places of origin in Myawaddy township after the withdraw of the Tatmadaw from their villages and 10,628 IDPs remained. Presence of Refugees at the border on the Thai side due to the influx from Lay Kay Kaw is no longer reported., Few returns also occurred in Thayetchaung township, Tanintharyi region as the situation is currently stable. Temporary returns of IDPs living in collective sites in Shan south are taking place towards less conflictive areas in Loikaw. IDPs move back to verify the situation and see the possibility to return permanently., On the other hand, a smaller number of new IDPs was reported this week. However, for the first time since the beginning of the year, 410 new IDPs have been verified in Mon State, indicating an increase of the conflict in this area., It is worth noting that the telecommunication disruptions and electricity cuts prevent to collect information in a timely manner.",https://reliefweb.int/map/myanmar/myanmar-emergency-overview-map-number-people-displaced-south-east-feb-2021-and-remain-14

Recovery and Reconstruction",2 Feb 2022,"ABSTRACT, The recent history of rural economic transformation in Myanmar and the effects of COVID-19 and the military coup in February 2021 provide important lessons for the design and implementation of plans to help the country recover from these scourges. The impoverishment of farming communities in Myanmar during decades of socialist military rule, beginning in the 1960s until the turn of the century, led to an outflux of migrants to neighboring countries. As the country opened up to foreign investment through economic reforms initiated in 2011, rural wages surged and farm mechanization services expanded rapidly. Together with increased remittance flows from migrants, higher rural household incomes drove growth in a wide range of non-farm service enterprises. Nevertheless, agricultural growth was low and most crop subsectors stagnated due to underlying and unresolved structural constraints such as poor infrastructure and inequality in land access., As in many other countries in Asia, border closures and lockdowns instituted to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in widespread employment and income losses. The Myanmar government pro-actively sought to mitigate the impacts through expanded credit to farmers and businesses. By the end of 2020, Myanmar was beginning to recover from the economic stresses of COVID-19. However, the February 2021 military coup resulted in a far more severe economic downturn than COVID-19 due to the collapse of the financial system, the massive resignations by public sector employees, and the prolonged movement restrictions. Coup-induced state failure greatly magnified the health and economic consequences of COVID-19 in terms of poverty, food insecurity, and stalled economic transformation. This paper uses a combination of macro, meso, and micro-level analyses to measure the impacts of COVID-19 and state failure on rural economic transformation through the lens of the agri-food system, and to draw lessons for policies to support broad-based and resilient economic recovery",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/beyond-emergency-relief-what-will-it-take-ensure-resilient-recovery-agriculture-and

RUFSS interviews about 2000 mothers of young children per round from urban Yangon, the rural Dry Zone, and recent migrants from these areas., Key Findings, Myanmar has experienced four distinct economic shocks since early 2020. The most recent of these shocks–the spread of the Delta variant–was devastating, with 63 percent of respondents stating that at least one household member had experienced COVID-like symptoms and almost all cases occurring in the May-September 2021 third wave were driven by the Delta variant., Twelve percent of interviewed households moved townships between their original township and December 2021. Around 84 percent of these migrants were from the Yangon sample., Physical insecurity has emerged as a key impact of political instability, with 55 percent of respondents in December 2021 stating they feel unsafe compared to 37 percent in May 2021., In December 2021, more respondents cited food supply problems (61 percent compared to 32 percent in May 2021) and 35 percent cited loss of jobs or income (31 percent in May 2021). Travel restrictions were also more commonly reported., Job loss has been high in December 2021–8 percent of urban Yangon households, 11 percent of rural Dry Zone households and 21 percent of migrants reported job loss., Income-based poverty declined among Yangon households between June and December 2021 (to 30 percent) but remained high among migrants (50 percent) and rural households (58 percent)., Mothers in urban and migrant samples were more likely to have inadequately diverse diets, and dietary quality seems to be deteriorating in the rural Dry Zone in 2021. We also observed a severe deterioration in the diet quality of rural children between 2020 and 2021., To cope with the crisis, households have not only cut back on expenditures but also sold assets (25 percent), taken collateral loans (15 percent), and borrowed money (72 percent) that they say will be difficult to repay., Recommended Actions",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/livelihoods-poverty-and-food-insecurity-myanmar-survey-evidence-june-2020-december

As of 31 January 2022, displacement figures reached a new high of 441,500 displaced since 1 February 2021. These include 232,500 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in South-East Myanmar – 91,900 in Kayah State, 48,700 in Shan State (South-all towns except Kyethi, Laihka and Mongkaing), 81,400 in Kayin State, 7,100 in Mon State, 2,600 in Tanintharyi Region and 800 in Bago Region; 7,100 in Shan State (North). In addition, there are 136,300 IDPs in Sagaing Region, 33,800 in Chin State and 21,400 in Magway Region., In the South-East, intense fighting - initially centred around Demoso Township, Kayah State - has triggered several waves of large-scale displacement with tens of thousands forced to flee their homes and seek refuge at places of worship, community centres, in host communities or in the jungle. The main needs are for food, healthcare services and winterization items to cope with the cold temperatures. Over 10,000 IDPs from Kayah State took refuge in Taunggyi Township, Shan State (South). Over 6,000 IDPs are now being sheltered by local host communities in overcrowded conditions. Thousands of people are still displaced by fighting in Lay Kay Kaw in the south of Myawady Township along the Myanmar-Thai border and are unable to return home. Over 9,700 individuals from Myanmar had fled the upsurge in violence in Kayin and Kayah States since 16 December into Tak and Mae Hong Song provinces in Thailand. According to the Royal Thai Government official sources, all of the individuals from Myanmar have voluntarily returned to Myanmar in various return movements., In Kachin and Shan (North) states, the security situation remains tense and continues to pose significant challenges, such as restrictions on movements around displacement and affected sites. Access to basic services, including education for children is hindered. Nonetheless, a few returns from displacement sites to villages of origin have been observed in Kachin State. In Shan State (North), the numbers of IDPs increased in Mongkoe, Muse Township due to fighting. While some returns were recorded from Mongkaing Township of Shan State (South), there was also new displacement following inter-EAO conflict between the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS) and Shan State Progress Party (SSPP)., In the North-West, UNHCR protection monitoring revealed an increase of displacement in Sagaing Region due to ongoing clashes. Shortages of food, winter items, fuel and medical supplies continue to be reported. At least 3,000 people from 30 villages in Matupi Township in Chin State have been displaced by fighting. On 18 January, up to 1,000 villagers fled their homes to surrounding areas following attacks in Gangaw Township in Magway Region., In Rakhine State, IDPs across Rakhine State, as well as non-displaced Rohingya communities, continue to face challenges in accessing basic services, livelihoods, and humanitarian assistance. Some return movements continue to be observed from areas of conflict, albeit small scale. Returns continue to be promoted by de facto authorities, including instances where village leaders in some displacement sites were instructed to encourage returns of IDPs. Recent privatization of land at IDP camp areas and land sales to private individuals in Sittwe and Pauktaw have led to an increase in IDP households having to reside in makeshift shelters. IDPs have also been asked to pay rent for use of land., The privatization of land has also impacted the work of humanitarian agencies, where humanitarian infrastructure is under threat of relocation and demolition. The increase in military presence in Kyauktaw and Ponnagyung townships has raised concerns among communities, both Rakhine and Rohingya, fearing potential resumption of clashes. This fear also triggered some temporary displacement from Kyauktaw Township., It is estimated that some 7,000 new arrivals have crossed into India from Myanmar in the past two weeks.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-emergency-update-1-february-2022

ECHO Myanmar/Burma Factsheet,News and Press Release,ECHO,"Contributions
Protection and Human Rights",3 Feb 2022,"The already dire humanitarian situation in Myanmar has worsened since last year’s military takeover., The coup d’état has plunged the country into social and economic turmoil, leading to a rapid deterioration of the security situation. Fighting between anti-coup militias and the Myanmar armed forces continues regularly across the country., Myanmar is also one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries, exposed to multiple hazards, including floods, cyclones and earthquakes., The United Nations estimates that more than 14.4 million people require humanitarian assistance this year, including those in protracted displacement in the conflict-torn states of Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan. This represents a 14-fold increase compared to 2021 and across a much larger geographic area., Following the military coup, intensified armed clashes have internally displaced an estimated 367,400 additional people. This adds to some 370,000 people driven from their homes by pre-existing conflicts., More than 1,400 people have been killed and over 11,000 arrested following the coup. Basic social services are disrupted, and Myanmar is experiencing shortages of essential goods, such as medical supplies and equipment., The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed the already fragile healthcare system to the brink of collapse., Since 2017, violence in northern Rakhine state forced more than 740,000 ethnic Rohingya people to flee into Bangladesh., Approximately 600,000 stateless Rohingya people remain in Rakhine, of whom 144,000 have been confined to camps since 2012. They are deprived of basic rights, including freedom of movement and access to livelihoods., Restricted access, coupled with strict COVID-19 preventative measures continue to pose significant challenges and have severely hampered the delivery of much-needed humanitarian aid in the area., , In 2021, the European Union allocated €23 million in humanitarian aid funding to address the immediate needs of the most vulnerable, including displaced and conflict-affected communities., The funding helps provide (i) foodSearch for available translations of the preceding linkEN**•••** and nutritionSearch for available translations of the preceding linkEN**•••, (ii) clean water and sanitationSearch for available translations of the preceding linkEN•••, (iii) emergency preparedness/responseSearch for available translations of the preceding linkEN•••, (iv) healthSearch for available translations of the preceding linkEN•••, (v) educationSearch for available translations of the preceding linkEN•••, as well as (vi) protectionSearch for available translations of the preceding linkEN•••**, including mine education to those affected by conflict., The upsurge in violence results in large-scale population displacements across the country. The EU responds to the most acute needs, including refugees seeking shelter in neighbouring countries and the wider region., Part of our humanitarian funding supports Myanmar’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The EU supports the provision of medical supplies and equipment, emergency referrals of displaced people and patients in pandemic-affected communities., EU humanitarian funding is provided in line with the humanitarian principlesSearch for available translations of the preceding linkEN**•••** of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence and is channelled directly through humanitarian organisations. The EU does not provide any humanitarian funding through government services., The EU has also responded to many natural hazards in Myanmar over the past 2 decades. In mid-2020, the EU channelled €85,000 to support those affected by a deadly landslide in a jade mining community in northern Kachin., The funding covered search and rescue efforts and first aid and psychological support to those affected. We provided cash grants to vulnerable families that lost their main breadwinners., Another priority is disaster preparedness, focused on increasing the resilience of communities that face recurrent natural hazards. Since 2010, the EU has allocated €16.65 million to coastal flood-prone areas and earthquake-prone urban areas., The EU has provided humanitarian aid in Myanmar since 1994. We have funded emergency relief programmes to assist victims of both conflict and natural hazards, with total funding of over €288 million., Since 2013, we also provided €8.65 million for emergency education to conflict-affected children, including €1.4 million in 2021., *Last updated: 17/01/2022, 14.4 million people need humanitarian assistance, More than 737,000 internally displaced people, More than 470,000 non-displaced stateless Rohingya, EU humanitarian funding:

Myanmar emergency overview map: Number of people displaced in South East since Feb 2021 and remain displaced (As of 31 Jan 2022),Map,UNHCR,Protection and Human Rights,31 Jan 2022,"WEEKLY HIGHLIGHTS, This week, the total number of IDPs have slightly decreased compared to last week, a total of 232,600 people displaced including an estimated of 600 people still remaining in the Thai border. The decrease is due to the return of about 5,900 people from South Shan to Pekon Township. In this area the conflict has temporarily ceased allowing people to return. The cold weather, lack of shelter, lack of proper clothing, lack of water and food should are considered as the main contributing factors to their return., However, the airstrikes resumed on 28 January which may lead to another displacement. In Kayin State, about 2,100 people also returned to Hpa Lu area., Despite the above returns, large displacements continue to occur in Loikaw Town and Demoso Township following the airstrikes, arrest and killings. This week was the largest displacement verified, about 7,900 people displaced from Loikaw and Demoso to Shan South (Hsihseng and Pekon Township- 5000 people) but also to Kayin State (mainly to Thandaunggyi Township- 2,800) and a residual number of people are also seeking safe location in Bago east., In Tanintharyi Region, approximately 1,000 people left from at least seven villages of Dawei, Thayetchaung and Yebyu Townships following the intensified clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces/MAF and local People’s Defence Forces. Most of the IDPs are being sheltered in Lay Eain Su village of Maung Mei Chaung of Dawei Township.",https://reliefweb.int/map/myanmar/myanmar-emergency-overview-map-number-people-displaced-south-east-feb-2021-and-remain-13
Monitoring the agri-food system in Myanmar: The rising costs of healthy diets – December 2021 survey round,Assessment,IFPRI,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition",2 Feb 2022,"Key findings, ▪ Between December 2020 and December 2021, the cost of an average healthy diet increased by about 20 percent at the national level and increased slightly more in urban areas (22 percent) than in rural areas (19 percent)., ▪ Healthy diets are more expensive than diets commonly consumed in Myanmar. It is estimated that the average common diet costs approximately two-thirds of the cost of a diet consistent with healthy diets recommended in food-based dietary guidelines., ▪ The cost of a healthy diet is highest in the Hills and Mountains agro-ecological region and lowest in the Dry Zone. The fastest rise of the cost of healthy diets was seen in the Coastal areas, where the cost increased by nearly 30 percent in 2021., ▪ Between September 2021 and December 2021, we observed a 21 percent increase in the price of vegetables., ▪ Between December 2020 and December 2021, inflation in micronutrient-rich food groups ranged from about 15 percent (vegetables, fruits, and animal source foods) to 24 percent (pulses). However, there is considerable variation between regions., ▪ The high and increasing cost of a healthy diet over the last year is worrisome, especially given the declining incomes seen in Myanmar. The rise in cost does not bode well for nutritional outcomes in the country this year., Recommended actions, ▪ It is important that vendors and their suppliers are allowed to continue to trade and that the smooth functioning of the food trading sector is prioritized during this difficult period. There should be few or no restrictions on national and international food transport flows and access to banking services for vendors should be maintained., ▪ Expanding social safety net interventions and integrating nutritional considerations–through larger allowances–to allow vulnerable and poorer households to afford nutritious but more expensive foods in their food basket should be explored., ▪ As pulses are widely produced domestically and are the cheapest source of protein in the country, promoting their expanded consumption should be considered.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/monitoring-agri-food-system-myanmar-rising-costs-healthy-diets-december-2021-survey

Trócaire stands with the people of Myanmar in call for an end to violence and restoration of democracy one year after the armed forces attempted to seize power,News and Press Release,Trócaire,Protection and Human Rights,1 Feb 2022,"One year since the Myanmar armed forces attempted to seize power, Trócaire stands with the people of Myanmar., On the first anniversary of the attempt by the Myanmar armed forces to seize power, Trócaire stands with the people of Myanmar in calling for an end to the violence, restoration of democracy, and respect and protection of people’s lives, security, and dignity., The last year has been among the most challenging in Myanmar’s recent history, and has had a devastating impact on people living across the country. To date, almost 1,500 civilians have been killed, while more than 11,800 people have been arrested. 8,700 remain in detention., Conflict has flared across the country – including in areas which have not seen active fighting for decades – and has led to massive displacement. The UN estimates more than 400,000 people are currently displaced because of post-coup violence. This is in addition to the 340,000 people who were displaced before 1 February. The UN estimates that by the end of this year 25 million people – nearly half the population of Myanmar – will be living below the national poverty line., The result is a major and escalating humanitarian crisis., We are especially concerned about the roughly 100,000 people who remain in situations of prolonged displacement in Kachin and northern Shan States, with no indication of when or if they will be able to return to their homes and villages. Their demands – for safety and security, education for their children, and opportunities to earn a living – are as pressing now as they have ever been., Amid this ongoing crisis, Trócaire reaffirms our commitment to working with and for the people of Myanmar, to listen to their concerns, amplify their voices, and stand together in solidarity., We acknowledge in particular the vital work of local civil society groups and community based organizations – in particular women centred organizations. Trócaire is proud to have continued to support our local partners delivering aid to approximately 96,400 people in Myanmar since the coup – around 53,500 women and 42,900 men., Our local partners have been at the forefront of efforts to respond to the coup, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic and the impacts of conflict. Local organisations continue to play a leading role in responding to crises, often at great personal risk., As members of the international community, it is essential we affirm our unwavering support in the weeks, months, and years to come.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/tr-caire-stands-people-myanmar-call-end-violence-and-restoration-democracy-one-year

Protection and Human Rights",1 Feb 2022,"On 1 February 2021, the Myanmar military staged a coup d’état and declared a state of emergency. The nullification of the November 2020 election result, and the detention and replacement of civilian government leaders with the “State Administration Council” (SAC) sparked nationwide protests by millions of people calling for democracy and the restoration of the civilian government. The exercise of freedoms of expression and assembly by peaceful protesters has been met with the use of unlawful and excessive force and a lethal crackdown by the Myanmar military. Since then, 1,503 people including women and children have been killed, with 11,711 arbitrarily arrested., Thousands of individuals including elected officials, civil servants, lawyers, human rights defenders, activists, have been arbitrarily arrested and detained, and forcibly disappeared. Members of the security forces have committed widespread and targeted sexual and gender-based violence including rape against women and girls, especially from ethnic minorities. The military and police systematically targeted human rights defenders and protestors, committing torture and other acts of ill-treatment in its various interrogation centres and prisons. In the past year, more than 120 journalists have been detained and three have been killed, 284 healthcare workers have been arrested, 113 hospitals raided, and 31 healthcare workers have been killed. According to the Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar, the preliminary evidence collected since the coup shows a widespread and systematic attack, amounting to crimes against humanity., Further, restrictions on the movement of humanitarian workers and aid convoys from reaching persons in need, especially during an ongoing global pandemic, have escalated the humanitarian catastrophe. According to the United Nations, 14.5 million people in Myanmar including five million children require urgent assistance., The Myanmar military has initiated sham legal proceedings without observing due process or fair trial procedures against protestors and political opponents. The conviction of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi for the possession of unlicensed walkie-talkies, the “incitement of public unrest” against the military, and violating Covid-19 restrictions, alongside President Win Thin, is just one such example. More than 759 people have been subjected to false charges and baseless convictions, including the sentencing of 118 people in absentia, and 84 sentenced to death by military courts since 1 February 2021., The Myanmar junta is using military tactics and is targeting individuals taking no part in any hostilities across various regions of Myanmar. It has carried out indiscriminate and disproportionate artillery shelling and bombardment of Karen (Kayin) and Karenni (Kayah) State and neighbouring regions for the past months violating international humanitarian and human rights law. On 24 December 2021, over 40 people were killed by the Myanmar military in Karenni State, including children and humanitarian workers. Abuses committed in a military offensive unleashed by the Tatmadaw in Chin State and Sagaing and Magway Regions in October – November may also constitute crimes against humanity and war crimes. These attacks have forced over 400,000 people to flee their homes resulting in widespread internal displacement and over 32,000 have fled across borders to India and Thailand, as well as Indonesia., The recent military offensives in Chin and Karenni States echo the Myanmar junta’s ‘clearance operations’ and ‘scorched earth’ campaign against the Rohingya in 2017. In Rakhine State, Rohingya persons face increasing unjustifiable restrictions on their freedom of movement, arbitrary arrests and stricter punishments on the attempts to flee the state, and intimidation by the security forces. Similarly, Rohingya residing in Bangladeshi refugee camps face heightened security risks, forced relocation to Bhasan Char island, and restrictions on access to education, livelihood, and movement., Despite multiple targeted economic sanctions by the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union, the military-owned and controlled companies involved in timber and the natural oil and gas industries, continue to engage in business and generate revenue.

One year later, the devastating impact on the people of Myanmar is clear. Over 14 million people are in humanitarian need, the economy is in crisis, democratic gains have been reversed, and conflict is spreading across the country. The military regime bears responsibility for this crisis, which has gravely undermined peace and stability in Myanmar and the region. We once again call for the immediate cessation of violence and for constructive dialogue among all parties to resolve the crisis peacefully. We reiterate our call on the military regime to immediately end the State of Emergency, allow unhindered humanitarian access, release all arbitrarily detained persons, including foreigners, and swiftly return the country to the democratic process., On the anniversary of the coup, we remember those who have lost their lives over the past year, including women, children, humanitarian personnel, human rights defenders,and peaceful protesters. We strongly condemn the military regime’s human rights violations and abuses across the country, including against Rohingya and other ethnic and religious minorities. We express grave concern at the credible reports of torture and sexual and gender-based violence. We express serious concern over the more than 400,000 additional people who have fled their homes since the coup. We also express grave concern at the deepening humanitarian crisis across the country and urge the military regime to provide rapid, full, and unhindered humanitarian access to vulnerable populations, including for the purposes of vaccination against COVID-19. We express grave concern over the large number of persons arbitrarily detained and the sentencing of State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and other political detainees., We call on all members of the international community to support efforts to promote justice for the people of Myanmar; to hold those responsible for human rights violations and abuses accountable; to cease the sale and transfer of arms, materiel, dual-use equipment, and technical assistance to the military and its representatives; and to continue supporting the people of Myanmar in meeting urgent humanitarian needs., We emphasise our support for the ASEAN Five-Point Consensus and the efforts of the ASEAN Special Envoy to support a peaceful resolution in the interests of the people of Myanmar. We call on the military regime to engage meaningfully with ASEAN’s efforts to pursue full and urgent implementation of the Five-Point Consensus, which includes ensuring that the ASEAN Special Envoy has access to all parties in Myanmar, including pro-democracy groups.

Myanmar Conflict Briefing,News and Press Release,AOAV,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",1 Feb 2022,"A year of brutal violence since the military coup in 2021, One year on from the February 1st military coup in Myanmar, violence and devastating harm to civilians by State military forces continues to intensify across the country. Last year (2021), Action on Armed Violence recorded 694 casualties from explosive weapons in Myanmar, 51% (353) of whom were civilians. The death toll was significant, as civilian fatalities outnumbered injuries, with 195 people killed and 158 wounded. At the very least, 76% (267) of all civilian casualties from explosive weapons were caused by Myanmar state forces, and in the case of 84 civilian casualties the perpetrator was unknown., Explosive violence is only one form of harm that has tormented civilians across the country since the February 1st coup. Over 1,500 civilians are likely to have been shot by junta forces in the last year, and over 11,000 activists, politicians, and journalists, among others, have been arbitrarily detained, with hundreds forcibly disappeared. The proliferation of armed actors and the continued political, civilian, and armed resistance has compounded pre-existing armed conflicts and insecurity across Myanmar. An extreme humanitarian crisis within and beyond the country's borders has escalated dramatically since the beginning of 2021, as over 400,000 people remain internally displaced, 32,000 people have fled to Thailand and India, and 14.4 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance., This country briefing report presents a summary of the key events leading up to the coup, and provides an overview of the conflict as it currently stands., Key Events and Timeline, The roots of Myanmar's protracted intrastate armed conflict go back centuries. The patchwork of ethnic and linguistic groups in the area have weathered migrations, secessions, invasions and infighting since the 1st century AD., In more modern history, the country's struggles for independence from Britain and a national identity in 1948, and General Ne Win's military coup of 1962, which resulted in Myanmar being under a military government for 26 years, have perpetuated disunity, social injustice, and violence that in many ways have characterised the country's history., Following the end of General Ne Win's active rule, Myanmar remained under the control of another military junta, known as the Tatmadaw, from 1988 to 2011, consolidating the status quo. A simplified timeline from 2008, when the first steps towards a nominally civilian government were taken, is presented here to provide an overview of recent events which have fanned the flames of the current violence., Key Actors, Aung San Suu Kyi, The daughter of independence hero General Aung San, Aung San Suu Kyi has been the face of the democratic movement in Myanmar since 1988, when she formed the NLD opposition party. She has been repeatedly arrested, detained, and released since then. In 2015, Aung San Suu Kyi led the NLD to victory, becoming the country's de facto leader -- despite the constitution preventing her from becoming president. However, she and her party have been accused of supporting the Tatmadaw's attacks in ethnic areas, and of blocking international humanitarian access to displaced populations. She has strongly defended Myanmar against charges of genocide, despite reportedly urging the military to 'crush' the rebels. Nonetheless, she continues to enjoy widespread domestic support., Min Aung Hlaing, Military commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing is the public face of the Tatmadaw and the current military government. He has been wielding significant political influence for many years, successfully maintaining the Tatmadaw's power throughout the move towards democracy. He is under international condemnation and sanctions for his alleged role in the Tatmadaw's attacks on minorities., The Tatmadaw, The Tatmadaw is Myanmar's military, which operates as a state within a state, maintaining a complex web of business interests. The UN Fact-Finding mission reported on the Tatmadaw's most 'opaque' operations, Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd. (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), which are allegedly owned by senior military leaders including Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, and his deputy, Vice Senior General Soe Win. MEHL and MEC reportedly own at least 120 businesses involved in everything from construction to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing, insurance, tourism, and banking. The Tatmadaw is known to inculcate enlisted men with intense propaganda., The National Unity Government (NUG), The NUG, a shadow government representing the elected lawmakers of 2020, enjoys strong popular support from the majority Burman population and some of the country's EAOs. It has taken on a wide range of government functions, including attempting to build political and military alliances with EAOs, repealing the unpopular 2008 constitution, and announcing plans for a federal charter., Urban Rebel Cells and Civil Defence Forces, Since the 2021 coup, grassroots defence forces have been springing up throughout the country to oppose the junta. Many of these groups operate at the local level, and are not all affiliated with the NUG or the PDF. Some associate themselves with local EAOs, and more still operate autonomously and in isolation. They use their numbers and knowledge of the local terrain to their advantage so that, despite being armed mostly with hunting rifles and makeshift weapons, they have been able to stretch the Tatmadaw's resources. In urban settings, underground networks of youths, who attend training camps in the jungle, adopt guerilla tactics to inflict harm on the Tatmadaw and protect their towns. Their tactics include bombings, arson, and targeted killings (including people suspected of being aligned with the Tatmadaw or acting as informants)., Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs), When Myanmar achieved independence from British colonial rule in 1948, the country was left with a patchwork of cultural, ethnic, and linguistic groups. The state's failure to protect or represent minorities resulted in the development of armed organisations, representing the military wing of ethnic political movements which sought autonomy and recognition. These armed groups, called ethnic armed organisations (EAOs), acted both for and against the state, which has been known to offer resources or autonomy in exchange for serving its interests in Myanmar's border areas, and allied themselves with, or acted against, groups representing rival ethnicities. The insecurity this environment generated only encouraged the creation of more and more armed groups, a phenomenon that has occurred repeatedly throughout Myanmar's modern history. This evolved into an almost constant state of disparate armed struggles throughout Myanmar over autonomy, ethnic identity, drugs, and natural resources, pitching EAOs against each other and against the military government., An estimated one-third of Myanmar's territory -- mostly the border regions -- is controlled by around 20 EAOs. Key groups include the United Wa State Army, the Karen National Union, the Kachin Independence Army, the Arakan Army, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army and the Myanmar Nationalities Democratic Alliance Army., Image: [Resistance to the Myanmar regime in Chin state -- a photo essay. (Alex McBride, Guardian)](image: Resistance to the Myanmar regime in Chin state - a photo essay. (Alex McBride, Guardian)), Myanmar's Intrastate Armed Conflict, The Geneva Academy's Rule of Law in Armed Conflict portal, RULAC, has designated the intensity of the armed violence in Myanmar, as well as the levels of organisation of the armed actors involved, as meeting the threshold to qualify as an intrastate armed conflict. Indeed, the February 1st coup has sparked the largest popular protests seen in Myanmar, and this is the first time that civil defence forces are forming. The line between civilians and enemy combatants is consequently increasingly blurred, reinforcing the Tatmadaw's violent repression of dissidents and civilians. All the while, the military government's semi-constant state of conflict with EAOs has reached an acute stage, as many armed groups align themselves in opposition to the junta., Since the coup, many EAOs have condemned the Tatmadaw's actions, and several have threatened the junta with retaliation for the deadly crackdown on civilians. Some EAOs have also proffered support to anti-coup forces, offering shelter or training to dissidents. Some are also allying themselves with local branches of the PDF on a temporary basis. However, many of the groups have long distrusted the ethnic Bamar majority, including lawmakers affiliated with Suu Kyi's government. They have consequently resisted aligning themselves with either the NUG or the PDF. Whatever the specific alliances of the EAOs, the military government now faces active resistance from EAOs in nearly all ethnic states of the country. The junta has lost all support from influential EAOs, and can at best maintain tentative cease-fires with some of the more powerful ones, as long as it is willing to allow them to continue promoting their local autonomy, influence and control. However, the Tatmadaw is also training and arming its own militia groups in various regions, resulting in violent clashes in mixed ethnicity states., Civil Disobedience, As well as taking up arms, communities are resisting in a wide variety of ways: refusing to pay electricity bills, thereby cutting off income to a state-backed power company; shunning companies aligned with the junta; boycotting companies and institutions that violate human rights; ignoring orders issued by the junta, such as wearing masks near where soldiers are stationed; and continuing to stage flash mobs despite the risk of violent reprisals. Public services are at a near standstill, as across the country teachers and medical workers are refusing to work in junta controlled facilities, choosing to operate in their own informal networks instead., Military Tactics and Weaponry, There is a large discrepancy between the weapons available to the Tatmadaw and some of the larger EAOs, and those which the civil defence forces and PDF are able to access. Furthermore, in civilian forces, most fighters have only had a few weeks of training. This strongly influences the tactics used by the different groups., As mentioned previously, the civil defence forces and smaller armed groups use mostly hunting rifles and makeshift weapons, engaging in guerilla warfare tactics. These include assassinations of junta officials, bombing military property, and sabotaging infrastructure such as telecom towers and bridges. They also target people suspected of being informants, or being associated with the military. The NUG has announced a code of conduct which is designed to protect human rights, but it's unclear how much control they have over the behaviour of the disparate and autonomous groups., The Tatmadaw has accumulated over $2bn in arms, supplied primarily by China and Russia, as well as Israel, Belarus, India and South Korea and its own lucrative business networks. They have reportedly been armed with a variety of military firearms, including Chinese RPD light machine guns, as well as local MA-S sniper rifles, MA-1 semi-automatic rifles, Uzi-replica BA-93 and BA-94 submachine guns. Despite the Tatmadaw's known human rights violations and crimes against humanity, the UN claims that 14 companies from China, Russia, Ukraine, Israel, North Korea, India, and the Philippines have supplied Myanmar with fighter jets, armoured combat vehicles, warships, missiles, and missile launchers since 2016. It also found that 59 foreign firms had commercial ties with Tatmadaw businesses., The Tatmadaw launches attacks on residential areas and civilians, notably using forms of remote violence which include explosions, artillery, shelling, grenades, or IEDs, and they have been accused of using civilians as human shields. They also block the supply of food and water to towns and villages. This is part of their well-established 'four-cuts' strategy, cutting off essential resources to local inhabitants, thereby attempting to destroy the support base of EAOs -- a strategy which they have expanded to areas where new PDFs have emerged. They are reported to fire indiscriminately, destroy food and aid, restrict medical access, and arrest family members. The junta is also targeting humanitarian volunteers, cutting off food aid and other supplies to displaced populations, as well as shooting displaced people returning for supplies.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-conflict-briefing
New plans to scale up 2022 humanitarian responses in Myanmar,News and Press Release,DRC,"Coordination

Safety and Security",1 Feb 2022,"**From Yangon in Myanmar, DRC’s Country Director Martin Vane reflects on the new 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan and the urgency of assistance at a time when crisis is deepening, and as the country is moving into a second year of renewed instability since the military seized control on 1 February 2021. **, What is DRC’s reaction to the new HRP that changes the entire picture and scale of humanitarian needs in Myanmar from last year 1 million to now 14.4 million people?, Without doubt, needs have increased since 1 February 2021, particularly in terms of displacement, protection of civilians, access to food in conflict areas. The severe wave of COVID-19 in 2021 has also taken a terrible health and economic toll, further contributing to the higher number of people in need now and for the 2022 response., *As we mark one year since Myanmar’s military seized power, we reiterate calls for Myanmar's military and all parties to the conflict to protect civilians from harm. *, *Displaced people urgently need shelter, food, water, medical care and other essential aid, including services for survivors of conflict-based sexual violence. Myanmar’s military and other actors must allow local and international humanitarian actors immediate, unrestricted, and sustained access to areas where people are in need. *, DRC is currently operating through direct implementation, remote management and work with local civil society and strong advocacy on regional and global level. Local civil society groups, community-based organisations and volunteers face considerable risks to their safety. We reiterate that humanitarian workers should never be a target., The new and ambitious HRP recognises that it will not be possible for humanitarians to reach all 14.4 million people with assistance. The plan, however, prioritises an unprecedented 6.2 million people for urgent support., What will DRC do now to be ready for this largely scaled up response and the focus on food insecurity?, *DRC has been in Myanmar since 2009 and is currently operational in four states across the country, with more than 400 staff on the ground and a vast network of local partners. **Our country office is in Yangon, and we have key field offices spread across Shan state, Kachin and Rakhine states and combines work of its own teams, field volunteers, partnerships with local civil society. *, *The work of DRC is already anchored in a solid operation and presence that offers support across communities in both urban, rural and isolated communities in Myanmar’s Rakhine, Kachin and northern Shan states. *, Our key areas of work reflect general protection, child protection, gender-based violence, humanitarian mine action, camp management in areas of displacement and wash activities. Part of our works supports also local communities related to securing their basic livelihoods and income through cash transfers., We are currently exploring new ways of scaling up and expanding our outreach. This is a challenge due to access constraints and not least because of Covid-19, but we are able to continue implementing activities and to reach increasing numbers of people in need through new and solid frameworks for remote management., The HRP describes how: ‘the success of this scale-up and the ability to reduce suffering on a national scale in 2022 will be dependent on three key factors – expanded and safe access to people in need, removal of bottlenecks such as visa delays and banking restrictions and increased funding.’, *DRC advocates strongly towards country level UN structures and towards key donors related to the need to ensure clear engagement principles which shall be prioritising humanitarian assistance. Such engagement principles are also key to be pushing for increased access towards all parties of conflict. *, *DRC along with other aid organisations in Myanmar, continues to advocate on national and international levels, the needs for safe and unhindered access to people in need. If not significantly improved in the immediate future, humanitarian needs on the ground in Myanmar will be even more dire. *, What we can expect if needs are not met is that larger segments of the Myanmar society will be further sliding into poverty, and we will see related increase in protection needs across the country. Finally, a lack of support to Myanmar can also drive further large movement of population towards the neighboring countries., It is now up to the donors to support the work outlined in the new and expanded HRP that aims to reach a minimum of 6.2 out of 14.4 people in need of humanitarian aid. How urgent is this funding - and what are the perspectives if the contributions from donors around the world are not coming in soon?, *Myanmar has been suffering for decades from various levels of conflict, several waves of Covid and also from being impacted by effect of climate change. Unless systematically tackled, this complex and multiple layer crisis could lead towards further disintegration not only inside Myanmar, but could impact overall stability of neighboring countries as well. *, During the past years Myanmar as a country has been able to advance on various fronts, but without continued and increased support, we risk seeing all these gains lost very quickly. Again, let us not forget that besides conflict and economic poverty, Myanmar is one of most vulnerable countries impacted by climate change and the combination of these factors might be driving country further to the brink of collapse., Read the 2022 Myanmar Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) on www.ReliefWeb.int",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/new-plans-scale-2022-humanitarian-responses-myanmar
JRS and SJES Call for Peace and Protection for the People of Myanmar,News and Press Release,JRS,Protection and Human Rights,1 Feb 2022,"On the one-year anniversary of a military coup that overthrew Myanmar’s elected civilian government, Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) and the Social Justice and Ecology Secretariat of the Jesuits (SJES) call for concrete action, including an end to the violence that continues to terrorize the people of Myanmar, increased access to critical humanitarian assistance, and protection for those seeking safety and security., Since the start of the conflict, an estimated 32,000 people have fled Myanmar and over 400,000 have been internally displaced. Armed clashes, economic stress, and waves of COVID-19 have significantly deepened humanitarian needs in Myanmar with 14.4 million people in need of life-saving assistance, 5 million of which are children., The weak and vulnerable are those who suffer the most. One internally displaced (IDP) family from Demoso Township shared, “We are currently living in an IDP camp. My father is paralyzed and my mother is blind. After we were displaced, my family has been struggling with basic needs. Both of my younger brothers were killed by the military when they went back home just to bring some food for us. We were left with young children and old ill parents. We feel really depressed and hopeless.”, The future is blighted as youth are left with limited options but to join the resistance. The level of violence continues to escalate causing death and destruction and forcing families and communities to flee for their lives. Humanitarian agencies are responding to these increasing needs but face considerable barriers to operations., As the Pope reminds us in his comments on the ongoing conflict in Myanmar, “God will convert all hearts to peace” and we must “promote dialogue and respect for others.” All must lay down their weapons and begin a process of peace and reconciliation that will lead to a prosperous and sustainable future for all. Those affected or displaced by violence within Myanmar must be provided with access to critical health and humanitarian services and the opportunity to return to their homes and communities., Neighboring countries have offered a mixed response with some tightening or closing borders entirely and others returning refugees without their consent. With a mission of accompanying, serving, and advocating for the forcibly displaced, JRS and SJES urge countries in the region to offer protection for all who seek safety, to meet the needs of refugees already within their borders, and to ensure that any returns are safe and voluntary., The time for action is now. The people of Myanmar must not be forgotten as they deserve protection and to live their lives in dignity and peace. The international community must join forces with those seeking a resolution to the crisis to ensure that families are brought back together, children are able to go back to school, adults are able to work again, and all are able to reconcile with God, self, and others. We express our solidarity with the people of Myanmar during this very difficult period of their history, inviting all to pray and work for justice, reconciliation, and peace in Myanmar.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/jrs-and-sjes-call-peace-and-protection-people-myanmar

Around 1,500 people including at least 100 children have been killed since 1 February 2021, and more than 11,000 arrested., In the past year, more than 400,000 people have fled their homes due to fighting, joining an estimated 340,000 people who were already displaced., Recent airstrikes and other large-scale military attacks in Kayah state — including the 24 December massacre near the village of Moso — have caused an estimated 120,000 people to flee their homes., Violence has also escalated in the western states of Chin, Magwe and Sagaing, with more than 130,000 people fleeing their homes since May 2021., Displaced people urgently need shelter, food, water, medical care and other essential aid, including services for survivors of conflict-based sexual violence and other forms of violence against women. Myanmar’s military and other actors must allow local and international humanitarian actors immediate, unrestricted, and sustained access to areas where people are in need., Local civil society groups, community-based organisations and volunteers face considerable risks to their safety. We reiterate that humanitarian workers should never be a target. The response from international governments and multilateral bodies has so far been insufficient. We call on the international community to take the following actions: UN Security Council to pass a resolution to facilitate the protection of civilians, a cessation of hostilities and increased humanitarian access, and set out the measures they will take to hold perpetrators of grave violations to account., ASEAN to expedite dialogue and formulate a clear action plan to deliver on its Five-Point Consensus. The consensus included as its first and second items the immediate cessation of violence in Myanmar and dialogue to seek a peaceful solution., Donors to increase funding to meet the scale of humanitarian need in Myanmar. 14.4 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, up from 3 million in 2021. Donors must specifically allocate funds to humanitarian programs that meet the specific needs and vulnerabilities of marginalised groups, including women and girls, who make up more than half of those requiring humanitarian assistance. More funding, including flexible and adaptive funding, should be made available to local humanitarian groups in Myanmar, with strategic investment in local and national civil society organisations, especially women’s organisations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/joint-statement-one-year-after-myanmar-military-s-seizure-power-aid-agencies-call

Shelter and Non-Food Items",1 Feb 2022,"Please see the below statement from Refugees International Deputy Director for Africa, Asia, and the Middle East Daniel Sullivan:, ""The Myanmar military's actions a year ago have unleashed an inordinate cascade of suffering. Through mass killings, forced displacement, and direct blocking of lifesaving aid, the military junta has generated a spiraling crisis with devastating humanitarian consequences., The number of people in need of humanitarian assistance has increased from around 1 million before the coup to more than 14 million people in 2022. The number of people forced to flee their homes has more than doubled, with more than 400,000 people newly displaced since the coup., Yet the response by the UN Security Council and regional neighbors has been woefully inadequate. The United States must build upon the steps it has taken to lead like-minded allies, particularly in Southeast Asia, with tangible actions. These actions should include further coordinated targeted sanctions, efforts to enforce a global arms embargo, and support for accountability measures. The United States can take an immediate decisive step on the latter by, at long last, recognizing the evidence and making an official determination that the crimes committed by the military junta against the Rohingya people amounts to genocide., More immediately, readily available actions to mitigate the humanitarian suffering of the people of Myanmar must be taken, including provision of cross-border aid through local civil society networks along the Myanmar-Thailand border. The United States must also engage Myanmar's neighbors toward ensuring that international assistance reaches new arrivals and refraining from forcing back refugees from Myanmar., A year since the junta's coup, the trajectory of the crisis remains alarming. The world must do all it can to push back on those responsible and to support the people of Myanmar."", For more information or to arrange an interview, contact Refugees International VP for Strategic Outreach Sarah Sheffer at ssheffer@refugeesinternational.org.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/one-year-coup-refugees-international-calls-global-action-myanmar

""The international community must take strong, meaningful steps to cut the junta's access to weapons, funds and legitimacy."", Andrews reiterated the urgent need for the UN Security Council to impose an arms embargo on the Myanmar military and stressed the need to significantly increase financial pressure on the junta, as many in Myanmar are doing with boycotts., ""The fact that one year has elapsed with no Security Council Resolution imposing a comprehensive arms embargo --- as arms continue to flow to the junta and kill innocent people --- is unacceptable,"" he said.

"One year after the military seized power in Myanmar, we reflect on the impact this had on the nation's older people and the services we have been able to offer help mitigate the impacts",News and Press Release,HelpAge,"Food and Nutrition
Health
Protection and Human Rights",31 Jan 2022,"Since the coup, Myanmar's public health system has largely collapsed, as many healthcare workers have been detained or targeted by the military for their affiliation with the civil disobedience movement., This meant that when a third wave of COVID-19 struck the country in mid-2021, the country's pandemic response was in chaos. Hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have died, according to independent media, even though the de facto government states that only 15,000 people lost their lives. This includes many older people who are always most at risk from the pandemic., Older people have also been put at risk by the increasing violence and attacks on villages by the Myanmar military. While their family members have fled to safety, they are mostly left behind in emergency situations. HelpAge has seen reports of older people being shot, killed, or physically assaulted by Myanmar armed forces., In one notable incident that took place on June 15, 2021, security forces set fire to a village in Pauk township, in Magway region, killing an older couple who were unable to flee. This incident was a foreboding of what was going to happen in other parts of the country. It was the first time since the coup that the military had started an offensive against the resistance forces, and showcased their brutality., ""Junta soldiers didn't even spare the 70-year-old lady. They brutally beat her in the violent raid on our village on October 26th,""
said a villager from Mandalay's Amarapura Township., Many people have also been forced to leave their jobs as a result of the crisis, forcing them to live without a regular income, while fears rise about the increase in violence. According to the World Bank, Myanmar's economy shrunk by 18 percent in 2021 and threatens millions with poverty, joblessness, and hunger. The United Nations Development Programme said that nearly half of the country's population is expected to be living below the poverty line by early 2022., Thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes to escape the conflict caused by the coup. According to the UNHCR, fighting between the Myanmar military and ethnic armed forces has led to the displacement of more than 377,800 people (as of January 10) and the need for humanitarian assistance is growing., HelpAge conducted two rapid needs assessments (RNAs) in April and October 2021 to understand the impact this was having on older people, interviewing 110 older people to find out about the circumstances they were living in., These assessments found that older people's needs are increasing in terms of lack of food, (mental) health, income, livelihood, and security. The needs vary highly across the country, but the biggest worries expressed were their ability to make a living and their health, reflecting the disruptions in the economy and public healthcare system., Our most recent RNA in October 2021 revealed that 85 per cent of older people were left with less than one month's worth of savings, while one in five older people had been forced to skip meals in the last week., **""Food is available in the market, but the price is rising rapidly. So, we use money wisely, like buying cheap food rather than quality food. We usually grow home gardens so there's no need to worry about vegetables."" **
An older woman, 92 said., Moreover, 38 per cent of older people interviewed said that they are unable to access health services and nearly all respondents (97%) said that they were afraid, worried, or stressed., ""I am afraid when the villages are attacked because I can't run like the others,"", A 67-year-old older woman said., ""In case of a war, how can I carry my husband who is lying in bed? This worries me more than how to fill my stomach,""
said an older woman, 66., Because of the current political instability, commodity prices are rising sharply in Myanmar. This severely impacts older people and people with disabilities, many of whom were already struggling financially., To ease this hardship, HelpAge has provided financial grants to 5,000 people with disabilities and older people across five townships. Besides cash support, essential food items such as rice and oil have been distributed to older people in selected townships., Personal protective equipment like facemasks, hand sterilisers, and gloves have also been provided by HelpAge to help protect older people from COVID-19., Living in an uncertain environment, under constant fear of violence, has left older people with mental health issues - without any support. We have been able to provide mental health and psychosocial support services to older people through homecare volunteers. These volunteers visit older people's houses and help them with basic daily activities such as showering and cleaning their houses, as well as addressing any fears, worries, or anxiety they may have, using the Inter-Agency Standing Committee’s mental health and psychosocial support toolkit for older adults - called “Living with the Times” – as a guide., Given the virtual collapse of the country's public healthcare system, HelpAge has been working with communities to identify people at risk in the catchment areas of clinics for non-communicable diseases to deliver screening and referral services. We have been able to offer patients referred for further support, financial support to access private health care facilities., HelpAge has also been providing training in making soap and hand sanitisers to older people, along with skills development to enable people with disabilities and their household members to earn a livelihood., ""I received hand disinfection gel, face masks, and gloves from HelpAge via our village leader. We use these items based on HelpAge's COVID-19 information pamphlets. I think, that is why we haven't been infected,''
60 years old U Myint said., There are around 5.5 million older people in Myanmar, comprising 10% of the population. The combination of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the military coup has increased their need for support, making it difficult for them to access health services or earn a regular income.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/one-year-after-military-seized-power-myanmar-we-reflect-impact-had-nations-older

Protection and Human Rights",1 Feb 2022,"One year ago, the elected government of Myanmar was deposed by military authorities. At that time, I explained that the issues surrounding this coup, its legality under the constitution and the effect on democracy in Myanmar were not within the mandate of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar. This is because the coup itself did not qualify as a “serious international crime,” a term defined in our Terms of Reference as including only genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. However, I explained that given the tragic history of the Myanmar military using violence against political opponents, the Mechanism was concerned and would be closely following events. I explained that if it appeared that crimes against humanity or war crimes were being committed, the Mechanism would fulfill our mandate to collect the evidence and build files that could facilitate criminal prosecutions of those persons responsible in national, regional or international courts., Tragically, reports received over the last year suggest that well over a thousand individuals have been killed in circumstances that may qualify as crimes against humanity or war crimes. The security forces have detained thousands of civilians in circumstances that include credible allegations of arbitrary detention, torture, sexual violence and even killings while in detention. The Mechanism is working diligently to substantiate and document the facts underlying these reports to establish whether these crimes were committed and if so, who is criminally responsible, and to prepare files that could facilitate prosecutions. The Mechanism has been able to gather a great deal of relevant material concerning these events and we are adding information and evidence to our files almost daily., The Mechanism is very grateful to the many thousands of persons and organizations that have shared evidence relevant to our examination of serious international crimes in Myanmar. We are committed to doing all we can to assure the safety and security of those with whom we interact and will make every effort to build cases so that their brave contributions to justice in Myanmar are not made in vain., Investigations of serious international crimes are always challenging. It typically takes a long time and significant resources to build good cases. The Mechanism is using all possible strategies and innovations to gather and verify evidence in order to build strong case files that can facilitate prosecutions in national and international courts., The cooperation of States where the evidence and witnesses are located is essential. The Mechanism is grateful to the many States providing ongoing cooperation and looks forward to strengthening and deepening such cooperation in order to advance its mandate., Governments all over the world have been unanimous in calling for a cessation of the violence by all parties now being inflicted on the people of Myanmar. ASEAN, in particular, has made the immediate cessation of violence, the very first point of its Five Point Consensus. The work of the Mechanism, by collecting evidence of the very worst international crimes, complements these efforts to end the violence., The Mechanism is closely watching events and working to fulfill its mandate. Those who are considering committing crimes should be aware that serious international crimes have no statute of limitations. International justice has a very long memory and one day the perpetrators of the most serious international crimes in Myanmar will be held to account.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/statement-nicholas-koumjian-head-independent-investigative-mechanism-myanmar
Myanmar/Burma: Declaration by the High Representative on behalf of the European Union,News and Press Release,EU,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",31 Jan 2022,"One year ago, on 1 February 2021, the military authorities in Myanmar forcibly overthrew the civilian government in blatant violation of the will of the people as expressed in the general elections of 8 November 2020. This act halted the country’s democratic transition with disastrous humanitarian, social, security, economic and human rights consequences. Since the beginning of the crisis, the EU stands unequivocally with the people of Myanmar, continuing to strive for a return to democracy., The European Union is deeply concerned by the continuing escalation of violence and the evolution towards a protracted conflict with regional implications. Since the military coup, the situation has continuously and gravely deteriorated. A large part of the population is now in a highly precarious situation, experiencing poverty, food shortages, displacement, and violence. More than 1,500 people have been killed, over 8,600 are currently under detention and 80 people sentenced to death. There are over 400,000 newly displaced people since the military take-over. This is in addition to almost one million Myanmar refugees in neighbouring countries., The European Union condemns in the strongest terms continuing grave human rights violations including torture, sexual and gender based violence, the continued persecution of civil society, human rights defenders and journalists, attacks on the civilian population, including ethnic and religious minorities by the Myanmar armed forces. Therefore, the EU calls for full accountability of the leaders responsible for the coup as well as of the perpetrators of violence and human rights violations. The EU also reiterates its firm demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners arbitrarily detained in relation to the coup and the return to power of democratically elected leaders., As a matter of priority, the EU reiterates its calls for an immediate cessation of all hostilities, and an end to the disproportionate use of force and the state of emergency. The military authorities must ensure rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access to all displaced persons and people in need, in all parts of the country. The European Union will continue to provide humanitarian assistance, in accordance with the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence and reiterates its call for the full and immediate respect of international humanitarian law., The European Union reiterates its strong support for ASEAN’s efforts in finding a peaceful solution to the crisis and stresses the need for Myanmar to implement swiftly and faithfully ASEAN’s Five-Point Consensus of 24 April 2021, in particular inclusive dialogue with all parties concerned – including the National Unity Government, the Committeee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw and the ethnic groups – as well as granting access by the Special Envoy of the ASEAN Chair to all stakeholders. We also fully support the Special Envoy of the UN Secretary-General, Noeleen Heyzer, and welcome her close coordination with ASEAN. We echo her call for trust-building efforts by all stakeholders and concrete progress on the ground., In view of the escalating violence in Myanmar, increased international action is required in line with the already existing EU arms embargo on Myanmar. Since the military coup on 1 February 2021, the EU has imposed targeted sanctions on the Myanmar military, its leaders and entities. In the absence of any swift progress of the situation in Myanmar, the EU stands ready to adopt further restrictive measures against those responsible for undermining democracy and the serious human rights violations in Myanmar., Press contacts, Nabila Massrali

Water Sanitation Hygiene",31 Jan 2022,"Highlights, In 2021, UNICEF received 34 per cent of its Myanmar Humanitarian Action for Children appeal of US $74.5 million, leaving a 66 per cent of needs unmet. Despite this gap, UNICEF’s response reached 96 per cent of its target (148,528 people) in providing access to primary health care services, 89 per cent of its target (77,758 children) in providing access to primary education, and 52 per cent of its target (227,013 people) in providing access to safe water., Since the military coup on 1 February, 320,900 people have been newly displaced nationwide, including 15,000 people who have fled to India. In the southeast, 175,700 people have been displaced, including 4,700 individuals who are now in Thailand as of December 2021. Prior to the coup, an additional 370,000 people were in protracted displacement due to earlier conflict mainly in Rakhine, Kachin and northern Shan states., Since the February 2021 military takeover, more than 100 children have been killed in Myanmar, including through shootings, airstrikes, indiscriminate artillery fire, use of explosives and being used as human shields., UNICEF, jointly with the Swiss Development Cooperation and in partnership with TdHL, funded the humanitarian cash transfer programme in Hlaing Thar Yar, benefitting a total of 5,300 recipients., Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs, Eleven months into the 1 February 2021 military takeover, the conflict has spread across Myanmar, affecting hundreds of thousands of people who urgently need multisectoral emergency assistance. Throughout the year, the expansion of the conflict has severely impacted the already affected public system and provoked increased population displacements nationwide, with some people fleeing their homes in fear of the armed conflict, and others leaving villages destroyed by armed groups. The northwest and southeast regions have been the most severely affected by the clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and the People’s Defence Forces and Ethnic Armed Organizations. As of 27 December 2021, the UN Refugee Agency reported a national total of 320,900 people who have remained displaced since the beginning of the clashes, including approximately 15,000 people who have found refuge across the border in India. This national total also accounts for 175,700 individuals who have been displaced in the southeast, including 4,700 people who have fled to neighbouring Thailand since the mid-December attacks in Kayin state. Prior to the coup and in addition to the previous figures, OCHA reports that approximately 370,000 people are in protracted displacement due to earlier conflict in Myanmar. This number includes 144,000 people, mostly Rohingyas, living in Rakhine state camps since 2012, 106,700 people living in protracted displacement camps in Kachin and northern Shan states since 2011, and 82,200 people displaced due to conflict between the Arakan Army and MAF from early 2019 and late 2020., In 2021, these mass movements of the population generated an array of new needs and exacerbated the vulnerability of specific groups, such as children and women, affected by the widespread violence. Humanitarian programming readjustments to the growing needs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic were still a priority this year, with newly added vulnerabilities since the start of the conflict. From the initial 1 million people in need identified at the end of 2020, the number rapidly grew to 3.1 million in the Humanitarian Response Plan addendum. Consequently, UNICEF revised its Humanitarian Action for Children in August, which highlighted its aim to reach 667,389 people including 316,164 children out of the 1.2 million children estimated to be in dire need of nutrition services, safe drinking water, health care, protection and education. All assistance programmes have been expanded, but humanitarian partners have faced additional layers of complexity in their implementation, including access restrictions to people in conflict-affected areas, security risks and threats due to hazards, and temporary suspension of their activities due to COVID-19 prevention measures. Despite funding gaps and operational constraints, UNICEF implemented its responses, including reaching 96 per cent of its target for providing access to primary health care services to 148,528 people, 89 per cent of its target for providing access to primary education to 77,758 children aged from 3 to 17 years, and 52 per cent of its target was reached for providing access to safe water to 227,013 people., As of 1 January 2022, a cumulative total of 531,025 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 19,274 deaths were recorded in Myanmar, resulting in a case fatality rate of 3,6 per cent. The escalation of the armed conflict, the population displacements and the impact of COVID-19 control measures have further restricted access to essential services, in conjunction with their impacts on children. As a result, approximately 12 million children missed school for 18 months due to the pandemic. Even though schools began to reopen in November 2021, the slow growth in attendance (40 to 50 per cent as of December 2021) demonstrated resistance to attending schools managed by the de facto authorities., The conflict’s impact on children goes further, with exposure to violence affecting their physical and psychological health and well-being, and the heightened risks of suffering from conflict-related violence including killing, physical injury, trafficking, recruitment and use in armed conflict, sexual violence, arbitrary arrest, and unlawful detention. Given the persistence of the conflict and its impact, UNICEF has estimated that the population’s emergency needs will continue to grow in 2022, with an estimated 25 per cent of the population needing humanitarian aid, including 5 million children.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/unicef-myanmar-humanitarian-situation-report-reporting-period-1-january-31-december

These working-hour losses were driven by employment losses as well as increased underemployment., Key sectors have suffered considerable impacts. Rural farmers were hard hit by armed conflict, violence and insecurity. Construction, garments, and tourism and hospitality were also among the hardest hit industries in 2021, with year-on-year employment losses reaching an estimated 31 per cent, 27 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively., The losses in both working hours and employment were disproportionately greater for women than men overall. Women also accounted for an overwhelming majority of job losses in garments as well as tourism and hospitality., “The military takeover and COVID-19 pandemic have put millions of workers in Myanmar in a grim situation. We are witnessing a reversal of years of progress in the labour market.

Please use the space prepared below, and create an attachment if needed., On August 30th 2021, about 70 State Administration Council (SAC)[6] soldiers[7] from Infantry Battalion (IB)[8] #60 entered into L--- and K--- villages, Special Area [Yay Leh village tract], Moo (Mone) Township, Kler Lwee Htoo (Nyaunglebin) District with three trucks. IB #60 is led by Captain Aung Yar Lin and is based in Than Bo Army Camp, Kyaukkyi Town [local villagers refer to it as Ler Doh Town]. Of the 70 SAC soldiers, about 20 of them entered into K--- village, while about 20 entered into L--- village (Karen part of the village) and the remaining 30 entered into L--- village (Burmese part of the village). They [the SAC soldiers] had a list with the names of five villagers in their notebook, so they surrounded and entered into the houses of [these five people]: Maw I---, Saw H---, Saw S--, Saw U--- and Saw Y---. They ordered these villagers to show their household registration, called out the name list of the household members and then took these five villagers with them, without any warrant or providing any information [about why they were being arrested]., When one of the victims’ family members asked an SAC soldier where they were taking him, he [the soldier] responded: “I will take him to Nant Thar Kwin [army camp] for a while and then let him come back.” Then [the victim’s family member] said: “Does he have to come back by foot?” Then he [the soldier] responded: “No. He will be sent back by this white car.”, Later, the victims’ family members learned that these five people were sent to the LIB #351 army camp at Kyaukkyi Town, instead of the Nant Thar Kwin army camp. Right after the incident, the L--- village (SAC) administrator U N--- immediately went to the Kyaukkyi army camp detention centre in order to help with the release of the five villagers and refused to return home even though the SAC soldiers asked him to go back., The SAC soldiers did not explain anything to the five villagers during their detention, nor did they investigate anything [interrogate the villagers]. However, they were kept in a detention room which was locked by the SAC soldiers. They did receive water and food while they were held in detention. The five villagers were released in the afternoon, after the Ler Doh (Kyaukkyi) Township administrator went to the detention place and gave the recommendation [offered testimony] that those villagers are innocent [however, it is still unclear why they were being detained]. One of the victims, Saw U--- stated: “Since people [the SAC] told us nothing about why we were arrested, I don’t [even] know the reason [for the arrest].” None of the local villagers knew why the SAC arrested these five villagers. Moreover, they [the detainees] had to arrange their own transportation back home from the [Ler Doh] township administrator’s village to their own villages., The Myanmar government administrator U N--- [who went to request the release of the detainees] was detained one night for further investigation. He was questioned by the SAC soldiers because they suspected him of having a connection with the Karen National Union (KNU)[9] and of holding a KNU meeting in his house. The SAC soldiers asked him questions such as: “Did you welcome the KNU to hold a meeting in your house?”, “Where is the [Karen National Liberation (KNLA)[10]] basic military training place?” and “Do you know where the CDM [participants in the Civil Disobedience Movement] live?” Since he does not know anything regarding those questions, he told the SAC soldiers that he does not know anything. He was released the next day., As a consequence of these arbitrary arrests, local villagers are now concerned about their security and that the SAC will come and arrest people in their villages., Part 4 - Permission for Using the Details, Interviewees gave permission to KHRG to use the information., Further background reading on the security situation in Kler Lwee Htoo District in Southeast Myanmar can be found in the following KHRG reports:, “Kler Lwee Htoo District Short Update: SAC troops fired mortars into a village, injuring three villagers, December 2021”, January 2022., *“Kler Lwee Htoo Short Update: Arbitrary arrest and killing, July 2021”, *August 2021., “Kler Lwee Htoo District Incident Report: One villager injured, another one missing after being shot at by the Tatmadaw in Moo Township, May 2021”, June 2021., “Kler Lwee Htoo District Short Update: Increased militarisation and fighting between the Tatmadaw and the KNLA prevent IDPs from returning home in Ler Doh Township, March to May 2021”, May 2021., Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in September 2021.

KHRG uses the term SAC military in specific reference to the Myanmar military since the February 1st 2021 coup. During previous periods of military rule, KHRG also used the names adopted by the military government in referring to the Tatmadaw (i.e. SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council] between 1988 to 1997, and SPDC [State Peace and Development Council] from 1998 to 2011), because these were the terms commonly used by villagers in KHRG research areas., [8] An Infantry Battalion (Tatmadaw) comprises 500 soldiers.

"Mu Traw District Situation Update: Human rights violations including looting, killing, arbitrary arrest and torture, and the burning of houses and villages, April to July 2021",Situation Report,KHRG,"Mine Action
Protection and Human Rights",28 Jan 2022,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in Bu Tho and Dwe Lo townships, Mu Traw (Hpapun) District, during the period from April to July 2021, including looting, killing, arbitrary arrest and torture, and the burning of homes by State Administration Council (SAC) troops. SAC troops in Bu Tho and Dwe Lo townships, Mu Traw District engaged in looting of villagers’ property, deliberately killed one villager, arrested and tortured another villager and made threats against other villagers. They also fired mortars toward villages, and purposefully burnt down villagers’ houses. Because of these human rights violations committed by SAC troops, some villagers are too scared to remain in their villages and have fled to other places.[1], Following the military coup on February 1st 2021, the State Administration Council (SAC)[2] has not respected human rights norms and thus has committed many kinds of human rights violations., This Situation Update covers events occurring during the period from April to July 2021 in Bu Tho and Dwe Lo townships, Mu Traw (Hpapun) District. During this period, soldiers from SAC[3] Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[4] #407 committed human rights violations against the civilians of Bu Tho and Dwe Lo townships. The human rights violations that occurred were: looting, making threats against villagers, arbitrary arrest and torture, arbitrary killing, firing mortars at villages, and the burning of houses and villages., Looting, A human rights violation occurred on April 7th 2021, in A--- village, Lay Hpoh Hta village tract[5], Dwe Lo Township, Mu Traw District. It was a case of looting., Soldiers from SAC LIB #407, who were coming to clear the landmines along the road from Hpapun to Kamarmaung, were not able to proceed past A--- village [due to the likelihood of being ambushed or attached by the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[6]]. Due to a KNLA blockage of the road, the SAC troops were not receiving their rations, and so they stole rice and various other goods they wanted from A---villagers. That looting occurred on April 7th 2021., Soldiers from SAC LIB #407 stole the following items from victims [villagers]: from Saw[7] B---, one basket [32 kilogrammes] of rice; from Saw C---, one basket of rice and two rice cookers; from Naw[8] D---, two square containers [each one equal to 18 litres] of cooking oil and a VIVO smartphone that cost 250,000 kyats [USD 140.61][9]; and from Saw E---, two large rice cookers, three fuel tanks, and a refrigerator. Soldiers from SAC LIB #407 forcefully took all these belongings., Killing, On April 29th 2021, soldiers from SAC LIB #407 were ambushed by the KNLA [where they were patrolling], roughly 30 minutes by foot to the south of G--- village, Ma Htaw village tract, Dwe Lo Township, Mu Traw District. After the ambush, as the SAC soldiers returned from patrol, they saw Saw H---, a 35-year-old G--- villager, who was in his own house, shouting and talking randomly because he was drunk. The SAC soldiers shot at Saw H--- several times. [Some] shots hit Saw H---‘s head, killing him at the scene [instantaneously]., On May 1st 2021, following Saw H---’s death, all G--- villagers abandoned their village and fled to J--- village in Myaing Gyi Ngu special area because they did not dare remain in their village [due to fear of the SAC and fear that fighting might break out]. On July 24th 2021, KHRG received an update that approximately ten households [out of approximately 70 households] had returned to G--- village., Arbitrary arrest, torture, and threats against villagers, A human rights violation case happened on April 29th 2021 in K--- village, Ma Htaw village tract, Dwe Lo Township, Mu Traw District. That human rights violation was a case of arbitrary arrest and torture., On April 29th 2021, soldiers from SAC LIB #407 arrested 47-year-old Saw L--- without evidence of any misdeed [and no explanation for why he was being arrested]. The soldiers were stationed in K--- village monastery to clear the road between Hpapun and Kamarmaung, which had been blocked by trees cut down by the KNLA. They [the SAC soldiers] [arrested Saw L--- in K--- village] then sent Saw L--- to M--- village, which is located five miles south of Hpapun Town. They confined him [Saw L---] in M--- village elementary school. While Saw L--- was held in confinement by troops from SAC LIB #407, the soldiers tortured him, crushing [bashing in] his shin with a metal pipe and stabbing his chest with a knife. He escaped [on his own] 20 days after his arrest and fled to hide in the forest two miles away from K---. [Although KHRG was able to speak with Saw L--- to get this information, no further details about his situation were provided.], Soldiers from SAC LIB #407 also threatened the villagers of K--- village, Ma Htaw village tract, Dwe Lo Township. Later in the evening on the day that Saw L--- was arrested, one of the commanding officers of SAC LIB #407 gathered the villagers in the monastery and threatened them, saying that they [the SAC] would fire mortars at K--- or burn the village if any villagers tried to help Saw L--- escape, or if he escaped [on his own]. Because of this, the villagers did not dare remain in the village and so some fled from the village to hide in the forests and valleys., Firing of mortars at villages, From April 30th to May 2nd 2021, Military Tactical Operations headquarters (1) based in Hpapun Town shot 120 mm mortars and 81 mm mortars, which fell and exploded in the surrounding villages [N--- and G---]. Because of the shelling and the flying of military aircraft [undertaking surveillance], the villagers abandoned their village and fled., Some villagers fled to the forest, some fled to Q--- village and some fled to Myaing Gyi Ngu special area, starting from May 1st 2021. As of yet [the end of the reporting period], the villagers that fled have not dared to return to their village., Burning of houses, On May 2nd 2021, soldiers from SAC LIB #407 burnt down houses in N--- village, Ma Htaw village tract, Dwe Lo Township. On July 12th 2021, they burnt down houses in G--- village, Ma Htaw village tract, Dwe Lo Township., In N--- village, the SAC soldiers burned houses belonging to 56-year-old Daw[10] P--- and to 52-year-old Saw R---. In G--- village, they burned houses belonging to 43-year-old U[11] S---, 40-year-old U T---, 49-year-old U W---, and 43-year-old U Y---., The villagers whose houses were burnt down do not dare return to their villages and find it difficult to build new houses elsewhere because it is the rainy season. Therefore, some of them are now living in the forest, while others are living in poor conditions in the buildings of various monasteries in Myaing Gyi Ngu special area., Villagers from Dwe Lo and Bu Tho townships, Mu Traw District, where SAC LIB #407 troops have committed various kinds of human rights violations, have abandoned their villages and fled to other places such as Q--- village and Myaing Gyi Ngu special area., Further background reading about recent human rights violations and the security situation in Mu Traw District in Southeast Myanmar can be found in the following KHRG reports:, “Mu Traw District Incident Report: Torture of three villagers in Dwe Lo Township by an SAC officer, August 2021,” January 2022., “Mu Traw District Short Update: Torture, fighting, indiscriminate shelling, and threats by SAC soldiers have resulted in fear and displacement of villagers in Dwe Lo Township, August 2021,” December 2021., “Mu Traw District Situation Update: Airstrikes, fighting, indiscriminate shelling and landmine contamination resulted in the displacement of villagers, one injury and one death in Bu Tho Township, Mu Traw District, March to May 2021”, December 2021., “Mu Traw District Situation Update: Landmine contamination, indiscriminate shelling, arbitrary taxation, movement of troops, and livelihood, education and healthcare situation, May to June 2021”, September 2021., Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in October 2021.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",30 Jan 2022,"Foreword, 2021 has been a traumatic year for the people of Myanmar, characterized by unprecedented levels of human suffering. Post the military takeover, so many of the impressive development gains the country has made over the past 15 years are now sadly under serious threat due to a combination of economic instability, COVID-19, escalating conflict, and a rapid and ever-increasing erosion of human rights. This has pushed record numbers of people into the humanitarian assistance space., At the time of publication, conflict has intensified across many new parts of the country, particularly in the northwest and southeast, leaving people traumatized and displaced. The situation is forcing increasing numbers of people to flee for their lives, sometimes taking shelter in neighboring communities and other times in jungles and forests with limited access to assistance. They join hundreds of thousands of people displaced by previous conflict who are living in protracted displacement sites, predominantly in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan. The majority of those displaced are dependent on humanitarian support for their survival and have limited options for return., Poverty is back to levels not seen since 2005 with almost half the population now unable to make ends meet. Steep price hikes, combined with job and income losses, mean many families can no longer afford enough food to eat and are slipping into humanitarian need for the first time. More than 13 million people are now in moderate or severe food insecurity as a result and the outlook for malnutrition is dire unless we intervene now. People are increasingly resorting to dangerous coping strategies to survive, leading to worsening protection risks., Faced with this grim outlook, humanitarians have recalibrated the humanitarian response in Myanmar for 2022, with a new national scope of analysis and action. The 2022 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) published in December makes a clear case for expanded response with 14.4 million people in humanitarian need. While it will not be possible for humanitarians to reach all of these people with assistance, the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) has prioritized an unprecedented 6.2 million people for urgent support based on the severity of their needs and a realistic assessment of our ability to deliver. This represents an exponential scale-up from our target of 1 million people at this time last year, but the situation demands that we do more, and I am confident that humanitarians will rise to the challenge. However, the success of this scale-up and our ability to reduce suffering on a national scale in 2022 will be dependent on three key factors – expanded and safe access to people in need, increased funding, and removal of bottlenecks such as visa delays and banking restrictions., Humanitarians stand willing and able to work in areas of need across the country but are facing access constraints that are delaying this lifesaving assistance. Local organizations are bravely delivering to people wherever they can, but this is only part of the solution to a crisis of this scale. Quicker, simplified and predictable access processes and assurances of aid worker safety are urgently needed for a humanitarian response of this size, allowing local, national, and international organizations to support people in need. Advocacy for this is paramount and the collective voices of humanitarians, key bilateral partners including donor governments, the UN, and ASEAN must be raised and heard., To carry out the ambitious programme of work outlined in this HRP, the humanitarian community requires $826 million. I encourage partners and donors to reflect on the pages at the back of the plan outlining the tough decisions we will need to make to further triage the response if we are not able to raise the funds we need. I urge donors to give generously, in solidarity with the people of Myanmar to save lives and protect hard-fought development gains while there is still a window to do so. Millions of lives are now on the line., Ramanathan BALAKRISHNAN

"Myanmar: One year into the coup, Bachelet urges governments and businesses to heed voices of the people, intensify pressure on the military",News and Press Release,OHCHR,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,28 Jan 2022,"GENEVA (28 January 2022) – UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Friday urged the international community to intensify pressure on the military to stop its campaign of violence against the people of Myanmar and to insist on the prompt restoration of civilian rule., “One year after the military seized power, the people of Myanmar – who have paid a high cost in both lives and freedoms lost – continue to advocate relentlessly for their democracy,” Bachelet said. “This week, I had a chance to speak in person with determined, courageous human rights defenders who are pleading to the international community not to abandon them, but to take robust, effective measures to ensure their rights are protected and the military is held accountable.”, “I urge governments – in the region and beyond – as well as businesses, to listen to this plea. It is time for an urgent, renewed effort to restore human rights and democracy in Myanmar and ensure that perpetrators of systemic human rights violations and abuses are held to account.”, Bachelet said she had heard chilling accounts of journalists being tortured; factory workers being intimidated, silenced and exploited; intensified persecution of ethnic and religious minorities – including the Rohingya; arbitrary arrests, detentions and sham trials of political opponents; “clearance operations” targeting villagers; and indiscriminate attacks including through airstrikes and the use of heavy weaponry in populated areas, showing gross disregard for human life., “And yet, courageous human rights defenders and trade unionists continue to protest, to advocate, to document and accumulate the mounting evidence of violations,” she said., The brutal effort by security forces to crush dissent has led to the killing of at least 1,500 people by the military since the 1 February coup – but that figure does not include thousands more deaths from armed conflict and violence, which have intensified nationwide., The UN Human Rights Office has documented gross human rights violations on a daily basis, the vast majority committed by security forces. At least 11,787 people have been arbitrarily detained for voicing their opposition to the military either in peaceful protests or through their online activities, of whom 8,792 remain in custody. At least 290 have died in detention, many likely due to the use of torture., Armed clashes have grown in frequency and intensity, with every part of the country experiencing some level of violence. In those areas of highest intensity military activity – Sagaing region, Chin, Kachin, Kayah and Kayin states – the military has been punishing local communities for their assumed support of armed elements. The Office has documented village burnings, including places of worship and medical clinics, mass arrests, summary executions and the use of torture.*, The crisis has been exacerbated by the combined forces of the COVID-19 pandemic and the collapse of the banking, transportation, education and other sectors, leaving the economy on the brink of collapse. The daily lives of people have been severely impacted, with devastating effects on their enjoyment of economic and social rights. There are projections that nearly half of the population of 54 million may be driven into poverty this year., “Members of Myanmar civil society have told me first-hand what the impact of the last year has been on their lives and those of their families and communities,"" Bachelet said. “The people have shown extraordinary courage and resilience in standing up for their basic human rights and support each other., Now the international community must show its resolve to support them through concrete actions to end this crisis.”, While there has been near universal condemnation of the coup and the ensuing violence, the international response has been “ineffectual and lacks a sense of urgency commensurate to the magnitude of the crisis,” Bachelet said. The actions taken by the UN Security Council and by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have been insufficient to convince Myanmar’s military to cease its violence and facilitate humanitarian access and aid deliveries. The High Commissioner welcomed some private corporations’ decisions to withdraw based on human rights grounds, as a “powerful tool to apply pressure on the financing of the military’s operations against civilians”., Bachelet also stressed that the current human rights crisis is “built upon the impunity with which the military leadership perpetrated the shocking campaign of violence resulting in gross human rights violations against the Rohingya communities of Myanmar four years ago – and other ethnic minorities over many decades beforehand.”, “As long as impunity prevails, stability in Myanmar will be a fiction. Accountability of the military remains crucial to any solution going forward – the people overwhelmingly demand this,” Bachelet said., ENDS, *The UN Human Rights Office will publish a report in March 2022 detailing the human rights situation in the country since the 1 February 2021 coup.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-one-year-coup-bachelet-urges-governments-and-businesses-heed-voices-people
"Violence intensifies in Myanmar as at least 150,000 children forced from their homes in the year since military coup",News and Press Release,Save the Children,"Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights
Shelter and Non-Food Items",26 Jan 2022,"MYANMAR, 28 January 2022 – One year since the Myanmar military seized power in a coup, the scale and severity of violence against civilians, including children and humanitarian staff, is escalating, Save the Children said today. In the past two weeks alone, children have been killed in several bombings and raids by the military in Kayah state[i] and Sagaing region[ii] [iii] [iv], including the bombing of a camp for internally displaced people (IDPs) in Kayah. In the past year, at least 150,000 children have been forced to flee their homes[v]., The UN Security Council must find ways to address the crisis and protect children from violence, attacks and displacement in Myanmar, the child rights organisation said., Recent UN figures show at least 405,700 people have fled their homes due to fighting within Myanmar since the military seized power almost a year ago, with that figure increasing by 27% in just the past month. Of the total number of people displaced across Myanmar, an estimated 37% are children[vi], many of whom are living outside in the jungle under makeshift shelters and vulnerable to hunger, illness and protection risks, the aid organisation said., Violence has particularly intensified in the southeastern state of Kayah in recent months, where last week two teenage sisters were among those killed in the bombing of an IDP camp. Recent UN figures show 91,400 people in Kayah state have fled their homes since February 2021, but local reports earlier this year said the more accurate figure is much higher – more than half its 300,000 population., Thawdar*, 14, had to flee her village in Kayah and is now sheltering in an IDP camp. She remembers the scorching sun and the sound of gunfire on the day she fled., She said: “When I was working on harvesting corn in the field, my aunt came and told us that we also need to flee as we heard the weapons loudly. It was urgent and we couldn’t take so many things. My mother packed some clothes, pots and plates. Then, we left our home., “I was so worried and thinking on the journey, ‘What if weapons hit us?’ I have always been afraid of the soldiers, and I pray they don’t reach the camp. I never want to hear the sound of heavy weapons again.”, Thawdar*, her family and others in the camp rely on food donated by Save the Children and other local charities to survive., Thawdar’s* mother Daw Merry*, 36, who has four children, said she constantly worries about meals and insecurity. She said: “If we do not have enough food to eat, what should we do? Sometimes I feel sad when I don’t have money to buy medicines or snacks my children want.”, Kayah state was also the site of an attack on at least 35 civilians, including four children and two Save the Children staff members late last year. The aid workers, both young fathers who were passionate about children’s education, were on their way back to their office after working on a humanitarian response in a nearby community when they were caught up in the attack., Inger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children International, said: “Yet again we are seeing children bear the brunt of conflict. Over the past year, a shocking 150,000 children have been displaced across Myanmar. That’s 150,000 children who are separated from their friends, their schools, and their homes., “Children and their families are fleeing because they have no choice, and we are seeing them forced to hide out in jungles and forests and living in terrible conditions. Save the Children teams are doing what they can to provide urgent assistance, but they have very little access to food, clean water and healthcare, let alone education. Children on the move are at heightened risk of trafficking, abuse, recruitment into armed groups, injury and death. Last week’s horrific attack on an IDP camp shows that children in Myanmar are caught between a rock and a hard place., “The Myanmar military, as well as all other armed actors, must uphold International Humanitarian Law, protect children and keep them out of harm’s way, and provide unhindered humanitarian access.”, Prior to the coup, there were already 370,000 people displaced across the country, including tens of thousands of Rohingya children living in detention-like camps in Rakhine state. The situation for them and the nearly 500,000 Rohingya children and their families who have fled into Bangladesh remains fragile. The brutal tactics employed by the military in Myanmar are reminiscent of the atrocities committed against the Rohingya in 2017, according to Save the Children., Inger Ashing said: “UN Security Council members must deliver on their shared responsibility to address the unfolding crisis in Myanmar., “Member states must impose an arms embargo, with a focus on limiting the kinds of airstrikes we’ve seen recently. The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) must also convene on an urgent meeting to review and action the ‘Five Point Consensus’ agreed in April 2021, which calls for an immediate cessation of violence in Myanmar and for the ASEAN Special Envoy to help mediate a diplomatic solution.

Myanmar: Year of Brutality in Coup’s Wake,News and Press Release,HRW,Protection and Human Rights,28 Jan 2022,"Governments Should Deny Abusive Junta Funds, Arms, (Bangkok) – Since the military coup on February 1, 2021, Myanmar’s junta has carried out a brutal nationwide crackdown aimed at suppressing widespread public opposition to its rule, Human Rights Watch said today. Concerned governments, including the United States, European Union, United Kingdom, and Japan, should together block the junta’s access to foreign revenues from oil, gas, and other extractives that are funding its abusive rule., Under the leadership of Sr. Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, junta security forces have carried out mass killings, torture, sexual violence, arbitrary arrests, and other abuses against protesters, journalists, lawyers, health workers, and political opposition members amounting to crimes against humanity. Military attacks in the country’s northwest and southeast have resulted in numerous war crimes. The nature of the security force crackdown – methodical, widespread, and systematic – reflects the junta’s countrywide policy of suppressing the opposition., “How many more people does Myanmar’s military have to detain, torture, and shoot before influential governments act to cut off the junta from its flow of money and arms,” said Brad Adams, Asia director. “Myanmar’s people, who have not given up their fight for democracy in the face of daily atrocities, need to know they have the global community’s support.”, On February 1, 2021, the military arrested the country’s elected civilian leaders, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, in early morning raids in the capital, Naypyidaw. In the ensuing weeks, millions of people across the country joined the anti-coup Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM), peacefully protesting the junta through mass demonstrations and general strikes., Security forces responded with increasingly excessive and lethal force, including live ammunition, grenades, and so-called less-lethal weapons. Police and soldiers massacred protesters in cities and towns across the country. The security forces have killed nearly 1,500 people since the coup, including at least 100 children. “When they came at us, we had nothing,” said a protester attacked on March 3 in Yangon. “We didn’t have a stick. We didn’t have a knife. All we had was our chants and our three-finger salute.”, On March 26, the junta’s MRTV channel warned protesters to “learn from the tragedy of earlier ugly deaths that you can be in danger of getting shot to the head and back,” and urged parents to deter their children from demonstrating: “Let’s not waste lives for nothing.” Security forces killed 160 people the next day., To contest the junta, in April, civilian members of parliament, ethnic minority representatives, and civil society activists formed a National Unity Government (NUG). In August, Min Aung Hlaing extended the one-year state of emergency, which the junta had declared on February 1, until 2023., The junta has arbitrarily detained over 11,000 activists, politicians, journalists, and others, according to the Assistance Association of Political Prisoners, and forcibly disappeared hundreds. Military tribunals have sentenced 84 people to death in summary proceedings that do not meet international fair trial standards. Detainees are frequently kept incommunicado, unable to contact relatives or legal counsel., Security forces have subjected many detainees to torture and other ill-treatment, including routine beatings, burning with lit cigarettes, prolonged stress positions, and gender-based violence. At least 150 people have died in custody, in many cases at military-run detention centers. “There was so much blood,” said a former detainee who was beaten during his eight-month detention. “I couldn’t even remember what I was there for. I couldn’t sit or stand. I kept wanting to faint. Maybe I did keep fainting.”, The junta has arrested over 120 journalists, about 50 of whom remain in detention awaiting charges or sentencing. At least 15 journalists have been convicted, the majority under section 505A of the penal code, a new provision that criminalizes publishing or circulating comments that “cause fear” or spread “false news.” The junta stripped the media licenses of seven local outlets and banned satellite television. “I’ve had to get my whole family out,” one journalist said. “Myanmar is not a safe place for anyone with a moral compass.”, Security force crackdowns spread beyond cities into rural and ethnic minority areas as resistance to the junta grew countrywide. The military continues to launch targeted and indiscriminate attacks on civilians, including airstrikes and heavy artillery barrages, the United Nations has reported. Accounts from displaced people and aid workers suggest that the junta has continued to use the military’s longstanding “four cuts” strategy, in which the armed forces maintain control of an area by isolating and terrorizing the civilian population., In some areas, recently formed People’s Defense Forces (PDFs) and other anti-junta armed groups fought alongside long-established ethnic armies against the junta’s military forces. In November, clashes were reported in every state and region in the country., On December 24, security forces summarily executed at least 39 people in Hpruso township, Karenni (Kayah) State, including four children and two staff members from the international aid organization Save the Children. Many of the victims were bound, gagged, and showed signs of torture, and some may have been burned alive. “It is one of the most shocking and depressing things I have ever experienced,” said a doctor responsible for performing autopsies on the victims., Since the coup, over 400,000 people have been internally displaced by fighting and unrest, primarily in the northwest and southeast, with an estimated 32,000 refugees fleeing to India and Thailand. The junta has deliberately blocked humanitarian aid from reaching millions at risk, in violation of international humanitarian law. Troops have attacked aid workers, destroyed supplies, and blocked access roads and aid convoys, seemingly as a form of collective punishment against civilians in areas where junta rule is contested., According to the UN, the number of people needing assistance in the country has grown from 1 million before the coup to 14.4 million, including more than 5 million children. About 25 million people, or half the population, are estimated to be living below the national poverty line., The Myanmar healthcare system has effectively collapsed since the coup. With the junta cracking down on medical professionals for their role in the Civil Disobedience Movement, Myanmar has become one of the deadliest countries in the world to work in health care, according to data from the World Health Organization and Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition. “We have to fight and overcome this, otherwise our futures are lost,” said one young doctor., From February 1 to November 30, security forces allegedly killed at least 31 health workers and arrested 284. Security forces have beaten and shot medical staff providing care to injured protesters and forced clinics operated by nongovernmental groups to close, driving medics and volunteers to work underground in poorly resourced makeshift mobile clinics., While the US, Canada, UK, and EU member states have imposed targeted sanctions on junta leaders and military-controlled companies over the past year, the junta’s foreign currency revenue remains largely untouched, in particular from natural gas sales, its greatest source of funds. Governments should immediately impose sanctions to block the junta from accessing the US$1 billion in foreign revenue that gas projects generate annually, and tighten sanctions enforcement on other sources of foreign revenue from mining, timber, and transportation facilities., The UN Security Council should end its inaction borne of political gridlock, and urgently pass a resolution that institutes a global arms embargo on Myanmar, refers the military’s grave crimes before and since the coup to the International Criminal Court, and imposes targeted sanctions on the junta leadership and military-owned conglomerates. If China and Russia continue to oppose council action on Myanmar, they should face concerted global pressure for upholding the junta’s indefensible rights abuses., “The one-year anniversary of Myanmar’s military coup serves as a signpost of a deepening descent into crimes against humanity and humanitarian catastrophe that the US, EU, and others need to address,” Adams said. “These countries should at long last impose costs on the junta that are too great for the generals to bear.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-year-brutality-coup-s-wake
"Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: Arbitrary Arrest by SAC, August 2021",Situation Report,KHRG,"Education
Protection and Human Rights",27 Jan 2022,"This Short Update describes events occurring in Paw (Paung) [also known as Maw S’Ko] Township, Doo Tha Htoo (Thaton) District during August 2021. The State Administration Council (SAC) military attacked the local Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) Aee Weh army camp, after which they arbitrarily arrested villagers who lived near the KNLA army camp. The victims’ family members have little hope they will be released. This short update also describes the SAC’s attempts to coerce local villagers to send their children to school.[1], Arbitrary Arrest, In August 2021, two leaders of the local Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[2]—Bo[3] Play in Bilin Township and Poo[4] Gaw Hkoh base in Aee Weh Army camp, Paw (Paung) [also known as Maw S’Ko] Township, Doo Tha Htoo (Thaton) District—passed away due to illness [Hpu Gaw Hkoh is known to have died of COVID-19 while the exact cause of Bo Play’s death is unknown]. Their deaths were a major blow to the local KNLA and its area administrative structure. Because the local KNLA leadership was disrupted by the deaths, the State Administration Council (SAC)[5] military took the situation as an opportunity to attack the KNLA army camp., On August 24th 2021, multiple SAC battalions [battalion numbers unknown] attacked and occupied the Aee Weh KNLA camp in Maw S’Ko Township. They arrested about 20 people after the fighting. Among those arrested were two Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) members [the exact number of CDM members arrested has not been confirmed] and some KNLA soldiers, but the majority of those arrested were villagers who were working on their farms and living in farm huts near the Aee Weh army camp during the incident. Four of the villagers arrested by the SAC were known to local villagers: Poo N--- and another villager with his two children. [Interviewees did not know the other villagers who were arrested by the SAC because most of the villagers who were arrested were from other places and travelled to the area to work on the rubber plantations as day labourers]. One local civilian, Naw[6] I---, said, “The general [Poo Gaw Hkoh] of that [Aee Weh] army camp died due to COVID-19. When they [SAC] heard that news they came to attack that army camp. They arrested more than 10 people [including KNLA soldiers and some villagers]. […] Those [villagers] who were arrested had nothing to do with the army camp. […] Their wives and children who are left behind cried a lot. I pitied them when I saw it.” [In a follow-up interview in December 2021, the interviewee stated that she believed around 20 people, not 10, had been arrested.], The SAC sent the KNLA soldiers and villagers they arrested to the new Zin Ma Thweh prison which is about a three-hour drive from the village. Only one villager, a rubber plantation owner, was permitted by the SAC authorities to go to the prison to bring food to her workers, who were among the villagers detained by the SAC. The families of the villagers who were arrested by the SAC could not do anything to secure the release of their family members, so they are now deeply sad and feel hopeless. According to Naw M---, “They arbitrarily arrested the civilians. These civilians did not revolt against them in any way. They arrested anyone on the road in sight. What they did is not in accordance with the law. This is just bullying. You think about that. How much will a person worry when his or her family members have been arrested? They might not be able to sleep well when they think about their family members who were arrested. They might not get strength when they eat because they always think about their family members who were arrested, wondering when they are going to be released. They might pray really hard at night. We feel sad since that happened. The KNU [Karen National Union][7] should request the release of arrested civilians. Those civilians are innocent, so I would like them to be released. The family members of those who were arrested are crying every day. I feel sad when I see that.”, According to an update that KHRG received on November 25th 2021, the villagers who were arrested by the SAC following the SAC’s occupation of Aee Weh army camp were still detained in Zin Ma Thweh prison and the SAC were still operating in the village., Education, KHRG also received information about the education situation in H--- village. H--- High School is a Myanmar government school. Since 2020, students in H--- village have not been able to go to school due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the situation worsened following the February 2021 coup. After the coup, the H--- teachers started joining the CDM to stand against the junta. The SAC tried to open the school and threatened parents in an attempt to coerce them to send their children to school. SAC soldiers were present in the classroom as security guards and new teachers were sent from an unknown village to work at the H--- school. H--- villagers assume those new teachers were sent by the SAC military., However, there were only about 50 students who went to school in June 2021, and the majority of these students were older. Most of the parents did not send their children to school due to their concerns for their children’s safety. Some of the parents did, however, take their children to school because of the SAC’s order to do so. One month later [in July], the school had to close due to the increase in COVID-19 cases. Naw I---, a villager who refused to send her children to school, said, “Only one or two students from primary classes attend the school. I don’t know [where those new teachers are from]. I have never seen them. We don’t let our children go to school. […] They coerced the villagers to send the kids to the school. Some parents are scared, so they sent their kids to school. In fact, no one wants to go to school. The soldiers intimidated them. The soldiers are guarding the school.”, Further background reading on the security situation in Doo Tha Htoo District in Southeast Myanmar can be found in the following KHRG reports:, “Doo Tha Htoo District Incident Report: SAC shot on sight a pregnant woman and her husband in Paw Township, September 2021,” December 2021., “Doo Tha Htoo District Short Update: Forced labour, looting and skirmishes between the SAC and the KNLA, August 2021,” December 2021., “Doo Tha Htoo District Situation Update: Fighting between the BGF and KNLA, and pressure to close KECD schools (April to June 2021),” November 2021., Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in August 13th 2021.

"Dooplaya District Interview: Looting, fighting, forced labour and COVID-19 infections, September 2021",Situation Report,KHRG,"Health
Protection and Human Rights",27 Jan 2022,"The following two interviews describe events that occurred in Noh T’Kaw village tract, Noh T’Kaw Township, Dooplaya District during the period between August 26th and September 14th 2021, and include information on looting by State Administration Council (SAC) and Border Guard Force (BGF) soldiers who set up camp in local villages following the destruction of their army camp, fighting between Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) and SAC troops, forced labour, and a rise in COVID-19 infections.[1], Interview | A--- village, Noh T’Kaw village tract,[2] Noh T’Kaw Township, Dooplaya District (September 2021), Name: Saw[3] B---
Gender: Male
Religion: Christian
Ethnicity: Karen, Looting and firing by State Administration Council (SAC)[4] security forces and Border Guard Force (BGF)[5] troops in A--- village, As you are a local authority [his role/position is unclear], have you seen any human rights abuses happen since the turmoil with the SAC military[6] [on August 26th 2021 an SAC military camp was burnt down[7]]?
For a few days during the turmoil, villagers were afraid, so they fled [from the village temporarily]. Some people who had tested positive for COVID-19 fled from the village and slept overnight [in the forest] together with dozens of other villagers who were fleeing. For me I didn’t flee., This was when their [the SAC] military camp was burnt down by the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[8] [on August 26th 2021]. In retaliation, [on August 28th 2021], they [the SAC] came firing gunshots along the way until they reached their camp. They didn’t arrest or stop any villagers., Did they use small guns like G-3, G-4 [Gewehr 3 and 4 battle rifles] when they came firing?
They fired big guns [unsure of the type of guns]. Their intention was to clear the road [prevent the approach of KNLA troops]., Did they fire big guns several times or just a few times?
They were firing along the way to their camp. It was up to ten times that they fired [while traveling]. And now they are rebuilding the camp., Have there been any more COVID-19 infections due to the infected villagers fleeing with the other villagers?
The infected villager who fled with the other [villagers], he and his parents were all infected. In addition, there was one more person infected. His name is C---. The infected person who fled was D---. Some of the fleeing villagers also said they lost their sense of smell. They might have been infected without knowing it before they fled. Because of this, we do not worship [in church] or visit each other’s houses anymore right now. They fled together in a group but now they cannot visit each other’s houses anymore., So if the SAC fire weapons again, the villagers will run together?
I think they will flee together, but fortunately there is no more firing. When villagers flee [from SAC soldiers], they forget to be afraid of the Coronavirus. They are only afraid of SAC soldiers., We heard that they [stole and] ate villagers’ chickens when they came to A--- village. Is that true?
Yes, they cooked [and ate] villagers’ chickens on the first night they arrived in the village [August 28th 2021]. They came with some BGF soldiers as well. Some villagers said it was the BGF soldiers who ate the chickens of the villagers. However, they were not sure because the house owner, Naw[9] E---’s mother, was not even at home [when the soldiers ate her chickens]. She was afraid, so she fled and slept at her rice barn in the village. However, she was sure that the chickens were eaten by the soldiers. Naw E---’s mother said she had about 100 chickens at first [before the soldiers arrived]. After the soldiers came, there were only about 30 chickens., I see. And were there any other household materials taken [by the soldiers]?
They took some pots, plates and spoons from the house. I don’t remember the exact number., So the SAC soldiers are not coming anymore right now?
Many soldiers are still there at the house of Naw E---’s mother., That means the SAC soldiers are still at her house?
Yes, they are still there. They do not leave anymore. They were there with a car. There are about 30 soldiers in that house. […] They also set up a machine gun beside the car [at Naw E---’s mother’s house]., Is it SAC Infantry Battalion [IB][10] #32?
People said it is [SAC IB] #32., Did the soldiers disturb villagers by questioning them when they pass by [the house of Naw E---’s mother]?
They did not do anything. They stayed there by themselves. The soldiers who are on guard duty would just sit on the bare ground. They knew that other armed groups won’t shoot them. Some of them [soldiers] might [also] watch in secret but we don’t know., So you can see them when you pass by?
Of course, every time. […], The other day, there were two soldiers who went to T’La Aww Klah [a forest near the village]. They took only one gun with them. The soldiers also patrol in nearby areas [near the place they have set up camp]., Have you heard about soldiers bothering villagers when going to F--- and G--- villages, besides firing gunshots?
No, they did not bother villagers. Such things happened in H--- village when the skirmishes happened.[11] You might have heard about it too., Right, I know about the skirmishes. I also would like to know more about how they [the soldiers] treat villagers.
Here, there was only one issue, about the soldiers’ taking villagers’ chickens and cooking and eating them. There were no other issues like intimidating villagers. However, since villagers have not heard about [incidents of] troop reinforcement in a long time, they were terrified when it happened again. So they fled from their homes., Right, villagers might be terrified because the SAC soldiers fired gunshots as they came.
Yes, villagers were already terrified even before they fired. Most of the soldiers were BGF though. There were just a few SAC soldiers., Which battalion of the BGF?
I heard that it was Eh Htoo’s and Saw Balue’s groups [BGF Battalion #1023 and #1021 based in Noh Ler village]., Did anyone tell them that the place they have settled [occupied] is a villager’s house inside the village?
Probably the village head was afraid to tell them. The SAC soldiers ordered him to meet with them once. People asked the [KNLA] soldiers to tell them [the BGF and SAC] about this. They [BGF and SAC troops] said they would change the place [move] but they kept stalling day after day. [KHRG’s researcher provided an update that the SAC troops and BGF stayed in the villager’s house from August 28th to September 14th 2021.], Do you think they have any secret strategy?
They might have that too. They said that their camp was destroyed and they have not rebuilt it completely yet. So they had to wait [stay in the village]., Did they ask for volunteer workers when they rebuilt the camp?
No, they just did it themselves., So they cut trees from the reserved [protected] forest that you maintain?
I think many trees were cut down from there., COVID-19 infections, Are you able to travel freely to buy food right now?
We can travel freely but we are afraid to go to Seikkyi Town because of the infection [COVID-19]. We just buy from the shop near the front gate of the village. That shop orders things from Seikkyi Town that are then delivered [to the village]. So we just buy from there. We are allowed to go to Seikkyi but we just don’t want to go., So Seikkyi is highly prone to the infection [COVID-19].
Yes, Seikkyi and Kya Inn are highly prone., So, you might not be allowed to visit each other’s villages?
Yes, we are not. We are afraid to get close to other villagers. We just talk at a distance when seeing them. We are allowed to meet and talk to other people but we have to keep a six-foot distance. We just have to be highly aware of it and protect ourselves the best [way we can]. We cannot do anything once we are infected., Don’t you have access to preventive medicine [vaccines]? Or [do only] those who are in Seikkyi Town have access to it?
No, we don’t have access to the vaccine. Those who were infected were given C-Vit [vitamin C], paracetamol, and cough medicine. The health worker in our village used to work in Hpa-an last year, so she had experience treating this disease while she was there. She tried to treat the infected villagers during the short period she stayed in our village. Now, she has already moved to G--- village. One of her fellow workers remained in the village to help treat us., Have your children recovered well?
Yes, two of my children [who were infected with COVID-19 and] who currently live in Htee Wah Kluh village have all recovered. They [the medical staff] are now treating the other [COVID-19] patients. It is said that those who have recovered from the virus have less risk [of being infected again], or that they cannot be infected again within two to three months. H--- is not yet recovered, but [name is inaudible] and I--- have already recovered [these are his children]., Is H--- able to move around?
H--- can move around but is not allowed to go anywhere. However, those who were infected claimed that they feel very tired to move around. Some of them lost their sense of smell while others still have their sense of smell, but all of them said they feel so tired. Some also said they have body pain., So they [COVID-19 patients] might not be able to run around?
Yes, they are not able to run around. They are just asked [told] to move their hands and legs, like light exercise., They cannot do heavy movement like playing cane ball or football, right?
When Saw J--- [perhaps his son, but otherwise another villager] came back [had recovered], he could do these activities but he was not allowed to do so. They [the medical staff] said you are not allowed do the activities that could make you tired if you are infected., Right, he is a teenager [so he might have more energy].
This disease is more dangerous for the older people with underlying diseases. The young people recover quickly once they are infected. They do not suffer that much., Didn’t the Myanmar government say anything about providing the vaccine?
Even though they talk about it, people in A--- village won’t accept the injection [vaccine] if it comes through the SAC. We are afraid to take it., What if you receive the vaccine from Thailand through Karen [organisations]? Will you feel confident to get the injection?
Of course, some people already got the vaccine injection, like Saw K---. However, if it comes through the SAC, people from here won’t accept it., I mean if it came through a Karen organisation.
Yes, we will be confident to accept it, except if it comes from China and Russia. We know that China and Russia are cooperating with the SAC, so we have concerns., Has this pandemic and the restrictions impacted the price of local cash crops such as lime, lemon and elephant yam?
The price of elephant yam remains the same. We can sell lime at the normal price. But there is too much big lime [lemon] on the market so we cannot sell it all. One hundred limes is around 600 to 700 kyats [USD 034 to 0.39][12] already now. We just sell it here, we don’t have to go to Seikkyi Town. There are people who came to buy it [directly] from here [the village]., It is better for villagers if they can still sell their cash crops.
Yes, we can still sell them., Are there any social issues such as complaining or arguing about the restrictions?
We haven’t had that in our village. We heard that some villages have had these arguments over the restrictions. Some village heads had to run [from the angry villagers]. For us, we are still allowed to go to work, so it is not bad. How can [authorities] restrict everything heavily when they cannot feed the whole village? Even though there are still heavy restrictions, people are infected more [infections are increasing]., So is there any medical support from the government? You mentioned Para [paracetamol] and other medicine.
We have paracetamol and C-Vit., Do you mean Tiffy [a tablet for treating a cold]?
Yes, COVID-19 patients were only given those medications. They have to take them three times a day if they have a fever. If there is no fever, they have to take them only once daily. They also have to consume a bottle of ORS [Oral Rehydration Solution] daily., When you say C-Vit, do you mean Tiffy, which is used to treat colds and nausea?
No, it is C-Vit, a kind of vitamin that has a sour flavor [Vitamin C]., Aww I see. So, people were treated with this medicine and they have recovered well. None of them died so far?
Yes, people recovered, including the old people. Saw L---’s mother is old but she is recovering now. She is almost able to dance like before. She suffered like an ill chicken at first., Interview | M--- village, Noh T’Kaw village tract, Noh T’Kaw Township, Dooplaya District (September 2021), Name: Naw N---
Gender: Female
Age: 22
Ethnicity: Karen, Fighting between SAC soldiers and the KNLA in M--- village, Could you tell me about the current situation in M--- and O--- villages?
Villagers in M--- and O--- are highly aware of the situation right now. They are living in fear., What is the activity of the SAC military in the area?
The SAC military are patrolling in the village areas. So villagers are afraid that fighting will happen., Are the SAC military still active in the area?
Yes, they are guarding the place [it is unclear what place is being referred to] in P---. Some people saw it when they passed by., Do they also come to the areas between M--- and O---?
They are patrolling a lot between M--- and P---. They also come inside the villages., Do they steal villagers’ livestock and call for [request] porters when coming around the village?
They do not call for porters. However, they are stealing the crops and vegetables that villagers grow [in their plantations]. I have not heard about the stealing of livestock yet., When they [the SAC] were fired at [by the KNLA], did they do any retaliation against the local villagers?
No, they did not do anything. The fighting happened inside the village though. It happened near Saw Q---’s house [on September 3rd 2021]. [KHRG’s researcher noted that the roof, ladder, and the wall of Saw Q---’s house were hit by bullets.], So villagers might flee?
Yes, they fled. The house owner [where the fighting happened] kept his children at a distance [a safe place either in the forest or at other people’s house]., Did they [villagers] flee to the forest?
Yes, they fled far from the village., Did many villagers flee?
Yes, they are afraid and are staying alert., Did the SAC soldiers ask for food from the villagers or the village head?
No. They only asked for navigators. [The KHRG researcher noted that three villagers were forced to go with the SAC soldiers as navigators.], Why did they ask for navigators when they already knew the way?
They wanted to keep them in front because they knew people [KNLA soldiers] were active in the area., So villagers in M--- and O--- are more afraid because the SAC troops are more active in the area?
Yes, they are very afraid. Even I stay away from there [her village, R--- village, is nearby]. I’m also afraid., You are afraid of staying here [in your village] as well.
Yes, we heard that fighting could break out in M--- village. So villagers here returned from their farms and plantations, and from outside of the village because we heard about that [the possibility of fighting] in advance [if fighting broke out, they would not be able to return to their homes]., Well, I just would like to ask you about the situation. So far, there is not much displacement yet right?
Right, they do not face many problems with food security or the disease [COVID-19]. However, in O--- village, outsiders are not allowed to enter anymore., What if the SAC soldiers enter?

The term has been used by KHRG throughout its reporting history, and most consistently during periods of civilian government. Since the February 1st 2021 coup and the military’s establishment of the State Administration Council (SAC) as the executive governing body of Myanmar, Myanmar’s armed forces have also come to be referred to as the SAC military. KHRG uses the term SAC military in specific reference to the Myanmar military since the February 1st 2021 coup. During previous periods of military rule, KHRG also used the names adopted by the military government in referring to the Tatmadaw (i.e. SLORC (State Law and Order Restoration Council) between 1988 to 1997, and SPDC (State Peace and Development Council) from 1998 to 2011), because these were the terms commonly used by villagers in KHRG research areas., [7] Karen Information Center (KIC), “KNLA သိမ်းယူလိုက်သည့် ခုတ်ခွားစခန်း အနီးသို့ စစ်ကောင်စီတပ် ပြန်တက်လာနေ”, August 2021., [8] The Karen National Liberation Army is the armed wing of the Karen National Union., [9] Naw is a S’gaw Karen female honorific title used before a person’s name., [10] An Infantry Battalion (IB) comprises 500 soldiers.

Myanmar: World must act now to prevent another year of intolerable ‘death and misery’,News and Press Release,Amnesty,Protection and Human Rights,27 Jan 2022,"If the international community continues to drag its feet on the grave human rights violations including lethal violence targeted at protestors that we have seen in Myanmar this past year, many more people will suffer and this human rights crisis could worsen, Amnesty International said today ahead of the one-year anniversary of the 1 February, 2021 coup., “Enough is enough, the 55 million people of Myanmar cannot afford another year of wavering and sitting on the sidelines by many governments around the world. Concrete action aimed at holding the military accountable and preventing their access to weaponry used to commit widespread human rights abuses must be taken now or the shocking death and misery that have defined life in Myanmar since the coup is likely to persist,” said Ming Yu Hah, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Campaigns., “As the anniversary of the coup draws near, the military has launched indiscriminate air strikes that have killed civilians in the southeast, blocked life-saving aid, and kept up a bloody campaign against activists and journalists, who have been detained and killed in custody. Too many governments continue turning a blind eye to all these atrocities, as they did following the gross violations of human rights against the Rohingya people. As a result, the military has been increasingly brazen, acting with impunity in its efforts to wipe out any resistance to its rule., “The Myanmar people are desperate and have become disillusioned about help from the international community. But there are clear steps that need to be taken to prevent the Myanmar military from maintaining its dystopian campaign of terror and persecution. The UN Security Council must stop dragging its feet, and instead impose a global arms embargo and targeted sanctions against military leaders, and urgently refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court., “In addition, all local and foreign companies in business partnerships with the military or military-owned businesses need to responsibly disengage, cutting the flow of funds that the military uses to prop up its lethal operations., “Closer to home, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) must present a unified front on Myanmar and demand the military to immediately stop the violence against civilians. The ASEAN should also exert pressure on the military to stop blocking humanitarian access and expand on and implement with a clear timeline its five-point consensus adopted last year, which has proved a failure., “The new year must bring new approaches to Myanmar, placing human rights for the people of Myanmar, accountability, and a zero tolerance to human rights violations and abuses at the forefront.”, Background:, Myanmar’s military seized power in a coup in the early hours of 1 February, 2021. Since then it has killed more than 1,400 people and arrested more than 11,000, with over 8,000 currently in detention, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. The shocking violence fits into a long history of well-documented crimes under international law against ethnic minorities in the country, including the Kachin, Shan and Rohingya., The UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar has previously called for Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and other senior officials to be investigated and prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide., The former civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been sentenced to six years on bogus charges and faces more than 100 years if convicted on all the counts against her. Many of her closest allies, including President Win Myint, have also been convicted on similarly trumped-up charges., Following the violent crackdown on peaceful protesters, some opponents of the military authorities have established the armed People’s Defense Force, which claims to have killed hundreds of soldiers through shootings, bombs and ambushes., On top of the chaos that has gripped major cities and towns across the country in the aftermath of the coup, economic and food insecurity as well as pandemic-related challenges have caused millions to face hunger. Hundreds of thousands have also been internally displaced while thousands have fled across the border to Thailand.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-world-must-act-now-prevent-another-year-intolerable-death-and-misery

In addition, it is estimated that 600 people remain on the Thai side of the border but spontaneous and/or forced returns have occurred during the week., The reception area for new IDPs remain Taunggyi and its surrounding townships in Shan (South) State with 10,000 new people who arrived last week, a small reduction compared to previous trends. Furthermore, the displacement within Kayah State had brought about 459 newly displaced to Hpruso. While the number has decreased compared to last week, airstrikes by the Tatmadaw had been reportedly taking place in Hpruso, Demoso and Loikaw impacting civilians. More forced displacement is foreseen in the coming weeks due to the continuous fighting., In Kayin State, clashes heavily intensified in Myawaddy, Kawkareik and Hpapun townships with shelling and airstrikes as well as attacks on the roads. The situation is worsening in the area with a significant increase of IDPs that could be verified, bringing up to 9,200 newly IDPs mainly in Kyainseikgyi, Hpa-an and Hpapun townships.

"Atrocity Alert No. 285: Myanmar (Burma), Burkina Faso and the 40th Universal Periodic Review",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,26 Jan 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., INTENSIFYING VIOLENCE IN MYANMAR BRINGS THE COUNTRY TO THE BRINK OF CIVIL WAR, More than 2,000 civilians in Shwebo Township, Sagaing Region, were displaced on 24 January when Myanmar’s (Burma) military – the Tatmadaw – torched their village in retaliation over an attack by a local People’s Defence Force (PDF). In Chin State, at least 3,000 people have been displaced in recent days as a result of clashes between local defense groups and the Tatmadaw. More than 30,000 villagers from Chin State have now fled violence in the region to seek safety in neighboring India. In addition, the military’s assault on Loikaw, Kayah State, by the Thai border, is ongoing and has contributed to the displacement of approximately half the region’s population., Meanwhile, the Tatmadaw has also continued to perpetrate airstrikes throughout the country, particularly in Magway and Sagaing regions and Chin, Kachin, Shan, Kayah and Karen states, against PDFs and civilian areas, including refugee camps. These escalating attacks appear to be part of a widespread and systematic scorched earth campaign. The Karen National Union, the Karenni National Progressive Party and the Chin National Front recently called on the UN and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to declare a military no-fly zone due to the Tatmadaw’s increased use of airstrikes on civilian targets., Amid this escalating violence, two of the world’s largest energy companies – TotalEnergies, the French energy conglomerate, and Chevron, a United States (US) multinational energy corporation – announced on 21 January that they will withdraw from Myanmar over worsening human rights abuses. This announcement came one day after TotalEnergies called for international sanctions on Myanmar’s oil and gas sectors. Oil and gas are Myanmar’s single largest source of foreign currency revenue, and limiting the Tatmadaw’s access to those funds is critical for hindering its ability to perpetrate atrocities. Liam Scott, Research Associate at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “governments have no excuse to avoid taking this concrete and impactful step towards limiting the Tatmadaw’s capacity to wage war on its own people. All UN member states – especially France, the US and members of the European Union and ASEAN – should now impose targeted sanctions on Myanmar’s oil and gas sectors.”, Nearly one year since the 1 February coup, the intensifying violence throughout Myanmar this past week has brought the country to the brink of civil war. Individual states, ASEAN and the international community must take the necessary steps to prevent further atrocities and a protracted conflict in Myanmar. States can and should do so by imposing arms embargoes on Myanmar to further limit the Tatmadaw’s capacity to commit atrocities. Targeted sanctions and arms embargoes are an effective and crucial way for states to uphold their responsibility to protect the people of Myanmar., RISK TO CIVILIANS INCREASES FOLLOWING MILITARY COUP IN BURKINA FASO, On 24 January a group of mutinying soldiers announced on state television that they had seized control of Burkina Faso after detaining President Roch Marc Christian Kaboré, suspending the constitution and dissolving the government and national assembly. The announcement came two days after riot police clashed with anti-government protesters in the capital, Ouagadougou. The leaders of the coup, the Patriotic Movement for Preservation and Restoration, said they acted in response to the “exasperation of the people.”, Discontent and criticism from civilians and the military had been growing over President Kaboré’s inability to stem pervasive insecurity caused by the spread of Islamist armed groups and their increasing attacks. These grievances have fueled a wave of protests in recent months. Some troops were also frustrated due to the lack of resources they have been given to fight violent extremism., While hundreds of people gathered in Ouagadougou to celebrate the coup, the situation has drawn condemnation, including from UN Secretary-General António Guterres, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union, who fear military rule could further destabilize Burkina Faso and the Sahel region. ECOWAS will hold an extraordinary summit on the situation in Burkina Faso on Friday., Burkina Faso has previously been known for peaceful coexistence between different religious, linguistic and ethnic groups, as well as a fragile stability until a popular uprising in 2014 that ousted longtime former President Blaise Compaoré, creating a power vacuum. In subsequent years, homegrown Islamist armed groups formed and regional factions of these groups also spread into Burkina Faso from neighboring Mali and Niger. During 2018 violence by Islamist armed groups worsened, with these groups increasingly targeting civilians and capturing towns and territory. According to Human Rights Watch, Islamist armed groups killed more than 350 civilians and kidnapped hundreds of others in Burkina Faso during 2021., Since the beginning of the crisis, Burkinabé authorities have struggled to provide adequate protection to populations, and at times, military and police forces have perpetrated atrocities against civilians, including murder, rape and torture while fighting Islamist armed groups. For example, in November, Burkinabé troops allegedly extrajudicially killed 15 men from around Djigoué village, in the south-west region, and three men from Poikoro village, in the Cascades region. The escalating conflict has resulted in Burkina Faso becoming one of the fastest growing displacement and protection crises in the world, with at least 1.6 million people displaced., Christine Caldera, Research Analyst at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “while the long-term impact of the military takeover in Burkina Faso remains unclear, the risks for civilians are heightened given the grave security threats and humanitarian crisis facing the country. As the situation remains volatile, it is more important than ever to ensure that the country’s human rights obligations are fully respected.”, UN REVIEWS HUMAN RIGHTS RECORDS OF SOUTH SUDAN, SUDAN, SYRIA AND VENEZUELA, The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) – a peer review process of every country’s human rights record – began on 24 January in Geneva under the auspices of the UN Human Rights Council (HRC). Among the 12 countries under review this session are South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Venezuela, providing member states with an important opportunity to examine ongoing systematic violations and abuses of human rights, and offer recommendations to governments to better protect their populations, who are at risk of, or are facing, atrocity crimes., Member states reviewed Syria on the first day of the UPR session, during which cross-regional delegations condemned ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity. Syria’s review occurred against the backdrop of the conflict entering its eleventh year, with Syrian government forces continuing to carry out indiscriminate airstrikes, as well as commit murder, torture and sexual violence as a matter of state policy., Yesterday member states took stock of Venezuela’s human rights record, which occurred amid ongoing government repression and persecution, and violations and abuses which may amount to possible crimes against humanity. Despite being a current member of the HRC, the Venezuelan government refuses to commit to genuine and system-wide human rights reform. The recommendations from the UPR will help outline necessary reform to address atrocity risk factors, which should guide member states’ decisions on long-term engagement with Venezuela., The UPR of South Sudan – which is scheduled to take place on 31 January – is a vital opportunity to insist the government take steps to ensure the full implementation of the 2018 peace agreement and address the underlying causes of intensifying inter-communal and localized violence. Member states should also reiterate the recommendations provided by the HRC-mandated Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, which previously noted that many structural factors that facilitated the commission of atrocity crimes in the past, remain present today., Sudan’s UPR – which is set for 1 February – will be occurring amid increased political violence following the 25 October military coup. Since then, pro-democracy movements continue to protest and demand a genuine civilian-led political transition. Member states should ensure that the UPR process does not legitimize the unconstitutional actions of the military, as well as address the deteriorating human rights situation in Sudan. Additionally, intensifying clashes in Darfur demonstrate the need for disarmament of ethnic militias and other armed groups, justice for past atrocity crimes and providing effective protection to all vulnerable populations., Savita Pawnday, Executive Director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility Protect, said that, “as the UPR is underway, states should utilize the process to ask governments about measures they are willing to take to protect their populations, how these will be implemented through system-wide, institutional reform, and who will be held accountable if they continue to fail to do so.”",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-285-myanmar-burma-burkina-faso-and-40th-universal-periodic-review
UN Security Council Should Act on Myanmar Atrocities,News and Press Release,HRW,Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding,25 Jan 2022,"One Year After Coup, Global Arms Embargo Urgently Needed, Louis Charbonneau
United Nations Director, United Nations Security Council member countries should abandon their timid approach to the Myanmar military’s mounting atrocities and replace mealymouthed statements with tough action., A year ago, on February 1, 2021, Myanmar’s military ousted the democratically elected civilian government, jailed many politicians, and unleashed a wave of violence against protesters opposing the coup, killing nearly 1,500. Renewed attacks on ethnic minority areas have resulted in numerous war crimes., Three-and-a-half years earlier, the same military launched a campaign of atrocities against Rohingya Muslims including murder, rape, torture, and the widespread burning of villages. A UN-backed investigation said the attacks against the Rohingya may amount to genocide., Between the 2017 campaign against the Rohingya and the 2021 coup, the Security Council did little more than issue a handful of statements on Myanmar, failing to put forth a single resolution. This approach surely gave Myanmar’s military confidence that any new wave of repression would largely be met with silence., Calls for the Security Council to hold a public meeting to discuss the violence since last year’s coup have gone unheeded, as has a campaign by dozens of organizations urging the council to impose a global arms embargo on Myanmar and targeted sanctions on the junta leaders and military companies., The United States, Britain, and the European Union have issued unilateral sanctions on Myanmar. But none has presented a draft resolution for the Security Council to negotiate. Why? Fears of a Chinese and Russian veto., But a veto threat hasn’t stopped them before. Russia, usually backed by China, has vetoed 16 resolutions regarding Syria’s armed conflict since 2011. US and EU persistence has sent a strong message that the international community is determined to hold parties to the conflict accountable for serious abuses., In June, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution calling on all governments to suspend arms transfers to Myanmar., A Security Council resolution imposing a legally binding UN arms embargo is urgently needed., If Russia and China want to side with Myanmar’s murderous military against the country’s people, nothing can stop them. But Security Council action is long overdue.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/un-security-council-should-act-myanmar-atrocities

All parties to the conflict must adhere to the provisions of international humanitarian and human rights law regarding respect for and the protection of health services and the wounded and sick, and regarding the ability of health workers to adhere to their ethical responsibilities of providing impartial care to all in need., PHR is calling on international actors to provide COVID-19 vaccines, medical aid, and broader humanitarian support to the people of Myanmar through flexible mechanisms that recognize the evolving nature of conflict dynamics and difficulty in reaching all people in need.

Safety and Security",26 Jan 2022,"415 Attacks on Health Care in Myanmar During One Year of Crackdowns Following Military Coup: Report, Ahead of February 1 coup anniversary, new report spotlights Myanmar armed forces’ brutal violence against health workers and facilities, January 26, 2022, At least 415 attacks and threats against health workers and health infrastructure in Myanmar were perpetrated during the one year since the country’s coup and the ongoing crackdown, according to a new report by Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), Insecurity Insight, and the Johns Hopkins University Center for Public Health and Human Rights (CPHHR). February 1 marks the one-year anniversary of the Myanmar coup d’état and the military’s ensuing crackdown on civilians, which has been characterized by targeted violence against health workers and obstruction of health care services, in gross violation of international law., “Our Health Workers Are Working in Fear”: After Myanmar’s Military Coup, One Year of Targeted Violence against Health Care,” based on open-source information, documents and analyzes trends in violence against health workers and facilities during the military crackdown since the coup, highlighting:, “In the year since Myanmar’s coup, nurses and doctors have been in the military’s crosshairs. Armed forces have harmed and intimidated health care workers, raided COVID-19 clinics and blocked vital humanitarian aid, resulting in the decimation of the Myanmar health system amid a pandemic,” said Lindsey Green, program officer for PHR and a report co-author. “Without immediate action from the international community to pressure the Myanmar military to end the bloodshed, Myanmar’s besieged health workers and civilians will enter a second year of a health and human rights catastrophe.”, The data featured in the new report covers February 1, 2021 through January 10, 2022. Researchers from the CPHHR, Insecurity Insight, and PHR used an open-source methodology informed by the Berkeley Protocol on Digital Open Source Investigations. The incidents reported are neither a complete nor a representative list of all incidents. Data collection is ongoing and data may change as more information is made available. However, the research provides a snapshot of how Myanmar’s military is persecuting health workers and targeting facilities amid its broader crackdown on civilians in the past year. The underlying data set can be explored at Humanitarian Data Exchange on a global map on threats and violence against health care., Attacks on health care have become a prominent feature of the country’s coup d’état. Today, Myanmar is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a health worker, with more reported attacks against health care in Myanmar in the past year than in any other country on Earth., While the highest number of monthly incidents were documented amid nationwide protests in March 2021, there has been a gradual increase in reported attacks from September 2021 through early January 2022, amid escalating armed resistance across the country and crackdowns by the Myanmar military., The new report also analyzes how forms of violence against health care have evolved alongside wider events happening in the country over the 12 months since the coup, including the nationwide protests, the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM), the disastrous third wave of COVID-19, and the declaration of a people’s defensive war., The report shows how, today, the people of Myanmar are facing gravely diminished access to routine and emergency health care services, with ongoing and egregious deliberate targeting of health care by the Myanmar military and other armed actors., Mandalay Medical Cover, a volunteer medical organization, provided a statement alongside PHR to the UN Human Rights Council about the impacts of violence against health care:, “Our healthcare workers are working in fear. We are being oppressed, we are forcefully arrested – as are our family members if we cannot be found – and are being prevented from providing proper medical care, resulting in permanent damage to patients and the loss of many lives…. By effectively and forcibly preventing doctors from providing essential medical care to these people, many lives which could otherwise have been saved are unnecessarily lost.”, Attacks on health workers violate human rights and are grave breaches of international law. The researchers offer a series of detailed recommendations to the State Administration Council, Myanmar military (Tatmadaw), National Unity Government, ethnic armed organizations, People’s Defence Force, and the international community., PHR is calling on the Myanmar military-led State Administration Council and Tatmadaw to immediately cease the targeting of health care workers with warrants and arrests for participating in the CDM and peaceful protests or for their provision of health care, as well as to immediately release people arbitrarily detained. All parties to the conflict must adhere to the provisions of international humanitarian and human rights law regarding respect for and the protection of health services and the wounded and sick, and regarding the ability of health workers to adhere to their ethical responsibilities of providing impartial care to all in need., PHR is calling on international actors to provide COVID-19 vaccines, medical aid, and broader humanitarian support to the people of Myanmar through flexible mechanisms that recognize the evolving nature of conflict dynamics and difficulty in reaching all people in need. This should include support for cross-border delivery of humanitarian aid (along borders with China, India, and Thailand) to reach those in need who cannot be reached otherwise., PHR is also calling on the United States Congress to pass the BURMA Act, which calls for the authorization of humanitarian assistance and targeted sanctions with respect to human rights abuses perpetrated by the Myanmar military. In addition to the February 2021 coup and ongoing crackdown against civilians, Myanmar security forces also perpetrated atrocities against the Rohingya people, which resulted the exodus of more than one million people from Myanmar to Bangladesh., As the one-year anniversary of the coup is marked on February 1, the human rights and health crisis continues to grow in Myanmar, with escalating conflict, increasing numbers of internally displaced people and refugees, and the effective collapse of the public health care system., “The impacts on the people of Myanmar of the military coup d’état and attacks on health care over this past year are incalculable and will continue to have implications for many years to come – especially as these attacks continue unabated,” the report states., Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) is a New York-based advocacy organization that uses science and medicine to prevent mass atrocities and severe human rights violations.

Q&A: One year on from the Myanmar coup,Analysis,ICG,"Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",25 Jan 2022,"Richard Horsey
Senior Adviser, Myanmar, The 1 February 2021 coup in Myanmar removed Aung San Suu Kyi’s democratically elected government. A broad spectrum of society continues to resist the coup in various ways. In this Q&A, Crisis Group expert Richard Horsey assesses the situation and what the future may hold., What is the situation in Myanmar today?, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing clearly did not anticipate that his power grab would face such strong, determined resistance when he engineered the coup a year ago. The resistance emerged almost immediately after his junta deposed the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, charging her with numerous offences most regard as trumped-up. Since then, despite its brutal repression of opposition, the military regime has been unable to consolidate control of the country. It is resorting to increasingly extreme violence to try terrorising the population into submission. It has killed some 1,500 civilians in the past year – including some who were summarily executed or tortured to death in interrogation centres – and arrested, charged or jailed nearly 9,000 more., Just in the last several weeks, soldiers drove an army truck at full speed into a group of peaceful demonstrators and bystanders in downtown Yangon, killing several people and injuring others; in Sagaing Region, the military incinerated a group of eleven villagers, including children, some apparently while they were still alive; and on Christmas Eve in Kayah State (a predominantly Christian area), regime troops burned 31 people in their vehicles after stopping them at a checkpoint as they tried to flee fighting between the army and resistance forces. In this last incident, four members of a local military-aligned militia were also shot dead when they tried to negotiate safe passage for the civilians., These shocking events have not diminished the will of a wide section of Myanmar society to continue resisting. Rather, they have prompted increased defiance among ordinary citizens. After the Yangon attack, residents across the city took to their balconies to bang pots and pans, a traditional way of driving out evil that was widespread across the country in the coup’s immediate aftermath, until troops began shooting at those participating. Now again, troops took aim at balconies and vandalised houses and parked cars in the streets. On 10 December, following the Sagaing massacre, activists called a nationwide silent strike. Despite threats from the authorities not to take part, nearly every business in Yangon and most other cities shuttered their doors and people stayed at home, leaving the streets eerily silent., Violent resistance has also continued to escalate in various parts of the country. After the Christmas Eve massacre in Kayah State, local defence forces that formed in the aftermath of the coup allied with an ethnic armed group to retaliate. The regime responded by launching airstrikes on the state capital Loikaw in early January, forcing more than half the population to flee. Local defence forces that have sprung up across the country in reaction to regime violence have also continued to step up attacks on military targets in Sagaing Region and adjacent areas after the massacre there. In the south east, one of the oldest ethnic armed groups in the country (and the world) – the Karen National Union (KNU) – is taking a more assertive military posture following raids by regime forces searching for dissidents and striking civil servants to whom the KNU had provided sanctuary. This shift of some ethnic armed groups toward more proactively supporting resistance forces is gathering pace, putting greater pressure on the military., Instead of reaping the expected rewards of power, Min Aung Hlaing and his generals are now locked into a spiralling crisis, deploying extreme violence to try to ensure the survival of their regime. Despite incurring significant losses, they still appear to believe that their military might and counter-insurgency experience will allow them to prevail in the end. With local resistance forces and the National Unity Government (NUG) – a parallel administration formed by lawmakers elected in November 2020 – determined to prevent that at all costs, violence looks set to further escalate over the coming months., What impact is the post-coup crisis having on ordinary people?, The double blow of COVID-19 and the coup has devastated Myanmar’s economy, with millions of people losing their jobs or sources of livelihood over the last year. The prices of many essential food items have surged as the national currency, the kyat, has plummeted in value, pushing up the cost of imports including cooking oil, agricultural inputs such as fertiliser, and refined fuels – and hence, domestic transport costs. A large proportion of the population, including in the cities, is slipping into poverty and food insecurity, wiping out a decade of progress and exacting a terrible cost on the most vulnerable., Public services have collapsed. Doctors, medical staff and teachers have been at the forefront of the civil disobedience movement, with the majority continuing to refuse to work under the junta. Those on strike have been targeted for beatings and arrest, while those who have continued working face violent retaliation from their communities and local defence forces. The upshot is a health system in disarray and schools likewise disrupted, with few teachers in classrooms and few students in attendance. There are widespread blackouts across the country as the regime has been forced to cancel power generation projects pegged to the U.S. dollar that it can no longer afford., Conflict across large swathes of the country has forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes since the coup, with more than 320,000 newly displaced by the end of 2021 – likely an underestimate given problems with humanitarian access and the fact that much new displacement is in areas with no recent history of conflict and thus no established reporting network. The newly displaced come on top of another 340,000 people who were uprooted by conflict prior to the coup, mostly in ethnic areas. With violence escalating, the number of displaced civilians is only likely to rise, with devastating humanitarian consequences as cutting off aid to civilians is part of the regime’s counter-insurgency strategy. Intensified fighting could also result in refugee flows into neighbouring Thailand and India., What has been the international response?, International efforts to address the crisis have been lacklustre at best, with Myanmar failing to get the attention it deserves. One reason is that major powers have been focused on the global pandemic response, as well as on other crises such as those in Afghanistan, Ethiopia and now Ukraine. The West in particular feels – understandably – that it has little leverage and a lack of good options to influence events on the ground. While the U.S., European Union and UK have imposed a series of sanctions upon regime figures and military-owned companies, these have very limited impact on the regime’s capacity to operate., UN Security Council divisions have been less evident on Myanmar than on many other issues, in part because members have tried to respect each other’s sensitivities on this file. The Council has not gone beyond issuing statements of concern, to no real effect. China mostly shares Western concerns about the coup’s economic and security implications, which are a threat to its interests, but is much less inclined than other permanent Council members (except Russia) toward sanctions, public condemnation or framing the crisis in human rights terms. Beijing is also reluctant to see an issue in its neighbourhood internationalised, preferring to approach Naypyitaw bilaterally or through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). India, a non-permanent member, has also been increasingly resistant to Council scrutiny and action on this case. For their part, the Western permanent members – the U.S., UK and France – have chosen to keep any disagreement within limits, in order to avoid the toxic divisions that have emerged on issues such as Syria., While these diverging views are a clear impediment to a more robust international stand against the regime, the fragile modus vivendi that remains among Council members on this issue is not completely without value. It has, for example, allowed the big powers to broker a deal that denies the regime representation at the UN and instead leaves incumbent Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, who has very publicly sided with the NUG, in Myanmar’s seat. This arrangement is a major source of irritation for the regime and provides the NUG with its most important international platform., Like most Western governments, the UN has been content to outsource most diplomatic efforts to ASEAN, whose member states agreed in April 2021 to a five-point consensus on steps the military regime must take to de-escalate violence. Despite internal differences, the regional grouping has eventually taken a stronger stance than many observers expected, particularly by banning Min Aung Hlaing from attending its summits – an unprecedented step for a group that traditionally prefers consensus and shies away from intervening in its member states’ domestic affairs. But its modest diplomatic efforts, under rotating chairs Brunei and now Cambodia, have gained no real traction with a regime unwilling to make concessions. There are now fears that Cambodian President Hun Sen in particular is too idiosyncratic – and maybe too influenced by China – to guide any meaningful diplomatic initiative. It is also tricky for Western countries to back a process led by Hun Sen given his authoritarian tendencies at home., In any event, while the generals do care about international opinion, to some extent, and crave improved relations with the outside world, nothing so far indicates that they are prepared to change their behaviour or political objectives in order to obtain diplomatic recognition., In Myanmar, the lack of international action has prompted considerable despondency, and some antagonism toward the outside world, particularly the West and the UN. Gone are the hopeful slogans seen in early protests calling for outside intervention; one recent banner read: “There is no supreme saviour” (a quote from the left-wing anthem “The Internationale”). Having come to the conclusion that they are largely on their own, people have taken their destiny into their own hands, including with armed struggle., While international leverage is undoubtedly limited, there is more that the outside world should do. Myanmar’s troubles will not be contained within its borders, and will likely give rise to significant regional and global challenges relating to public health, refugee flows and security, particularly vis-à-vis the drug trade and other illicit activities. There is also no prospect of resolving the Rohingya refugee crisis unless the Myanmar situation is addressed., Foreign donors must continue to support the Myanmar people through delivery of humanitarian aid, which requires funding but also greater diplomatic dexterity and attention, to navigate the very difficult aid environment and ensure that conflict-affected populations benefit, not the regime. Beyond humanitarian assistance and protection, long-term support for public health, education and livelihoods, as well as for civil society organisations and journalists, will be vital. Technical and financial assistance to strengthen the NUG’s administrative capacity can help and is more feasible than formal recognition of the NUG – which many in Myanmar are demanding, but which foreign governments remain very reluctant about, given their need to maintain channels to the regime. The new UN special envoy, Noeleen Heyzer of Singapore, has an important role to play, given her deep knowledge of the UN system and strong diplomatic networks in ASEAN. Governments around the world should do all they can to support her mandate., How is the situation likely to evolve from here?, The regime has made clear what its plans are, announcing early on a “five-point road map” that it has printed on the front page of state newspapers every day since shortly after the coup. Min Aung Hlaing’s plan is focused on holding elections in mid-2023, after which the junta will supposedly hand over power to an elected president – two and a half years after the coup. In the meantime, the regime is doing everything it can to ensure that the electoral playing field is tilted decisively in its favour. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has already been sentenced to years in prison on several dubious counts and faces more criminal charges, is likely to remain in detention indefinitely; her party, the immensely popular National League for Democracy, is facing dissolution; and the regime-appointed election commission is putting in place a contrived new electoral system designed to prevent the emergence of any dominant party, ensuring that the military remains kingmaker thanks to its 25 per cent bloc of seats in parliament., Yet it is hard to see how the regime could hold elections when almost the entire country is in revolt. It is even harder to fathom how new elections could put an end to the political crisis. Popular anger at the military is such that hardly anyone would see a new government made up of recently retired generals in civilian garb as any kind of step forward. Nor would most people deign to participate in such a farce. In these circumstances, polls would be a flashpoint for dissent and unrest, not a step toward stability., Myanmar will thus likely remain in a state of tumult for the foreseeable future. Resistance groups are getting more sophisticated at targeting regime forces, and increasingly cooperating with various ethnic armed groups, some of which have significant military capabilities. While these trends are likely to continue, actually toppling the regime – which is fearful of the retribution it would face from a furious nation – is much more difficult for resistance groups to achieve. With neither side in a position to deliver a decisive blow to the other, a protracted and increasingly violent confrontation appears inevitable. For now, much of the country will therefore likely be under the control of a patchwork of local actors, including Myanmar military units, resistance forces and, in some cases, criminal actors, who will step in to fill security vacuums and seek to profit from them. Caught in the middle will be ordinary citizens, who are already paying a terrible price.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/qa-one-year-myanmar-coup

Monitoring the agri-food system in Myanmar: Rice Millers – November 2021 survey round,Assessment,IFPRI,"Agriculture
Food and Nutrition
Protection and Human Rights",21 Jan 2022,"In November 2021, we surveyed 392 medium- and large-scale rice millers from major rice-growing regions of Myanmar to learn more about the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and political instability. This report presents important results and analysis from those interviews., Key findings, ▪ Mill activity increased in November as paddy harvesting began. However, monthly throughput among active mills is 11 percent lower than in the same period in 2020. Looking back over the monsoon production season (April-September), reported throughput was also 13 percent lower than in 2020. Looking forward, 57 percent of millers expect lower monsoon harvest season throughput (Oct-Jan) in 2021 relative to 2020, and two-thirds attribute the expected decline to lower paddy harvest volumes in their areas., ▪ Challenges in the banking sector continue to be salient. Nearly half of interviewed mills report disruptions in making payments for paddy or receiving payments for rice, and 52 percent of mills consider banking disruptions as the most severe. As a result, mills are heavily reliant on cash. Inperson bank transfers increased for rice sales transactions relative to September but are still far below half of their 2020 level., ▪ Sixty-three percent of millers reported increased transportation costs. The average price to transport a bag of rice to Yangon increased by 22 percent in November 2021 compared to November 2020 and reported diesel prices are 72 percent higher than last year., ▪ Emata paddy prices and milling margins continue to be remarkably stable during this tumultuous time and there are no apparent major price disruptions at the farm or mill-level for Emata rice varieties. Prices declined in November 2021 relative to September following the influx of paddy from monsoon harvests. However, prices of Pawsan rice varieties are 25 percent higher than a year ago. Further, rising transportation costs and a decline in milling throughput will likely lead to higher consumer rice prices for all varieties. Given the huge importance of rice in diets, together with income and employment declines, rice price increases will have outsized negative effects., Recommendations, ▪ Credit guarantees to enable banks or MFIs to expand working capital to the milling sector should be considered to ensure the financial viability of rice milling., ▪ Easing transport restrictions, stabilizing fuel prices, and continued operation of export markets would bring much needed stability to rice markets while relaxing the financial and production constraints that millers are experiencing.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/monitoring-agri-food-system-myanmar-rice-millers-november-2021-survey-round

A total of 405,700 displaced within Myanmar was recorded, as a result of armed conflict and unrest since 1 February 2021. This is an increase of 27% in just one month and the total now includes 217,900 internally displaced persons (IDPs) in South-East Myanmar – 91,400 in Kayah State, 42,600 in Shan State (South), 74,600 in Kayin State, 7,100 in Mon State, 1,600 in Tanintharyi Region and 600 in Bago Region; 7,500 in Shan State (North). In addition, there are 33,800 IDPs in Chin State, 20,100 in Magway Region and 113,900 in Sagaing Region., Clashes intensified in the South-East and there were reports of the killing of civilians including at least 35 people in one incident – among them four children and two staff members of the humanitarian organization, Save the Children – in Kayah State. Violence in Kayin State led to fresh displacement of 16,000 people, while people also fled clashes in Shan State (South)., In the South-East, the security situation has sharply deteriorated in Kayin and Kayah states with large scale displacement reported following clashes which started on 15 December in Lay Kay Kaw in southern Myawaddy Township and surrounding areas. A substantial proportion of Kayah State’s 300,000 population is now displaced, and thousands of families continue to live under makeshift tents along the Thailand-Myanmar border. Between 16 December 2021 to 17 January 2022, some 9,700 individuals sought safety in Tak and Mae Hong Son provinces in Thailand from the upsurge in violence in Kayin and Kayah. Of this number, some 1,200 individuals remain in one temporary safety area. Despite the gradual return of over 8,500 individuals, many of whom remain internally displaced in border areas, new refugees continue to cross to Thailand. UNHCR and inter-agency partners are advocating for the transfer of the remaining population to holding areas for more suitable temporary accommodation and improved humanitarian assistance., In Kachin and Shan (North) states, the situation remains volatile with sporadic clashes reported in Kachin State between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and Kachin Independence Army. In Shan State (North), clashes continue between the MAF and ethnic armed organizations (EAOs)., In the North-West: Tensions between local People's Defence Forces (PDF), the Chinland Defence Forces (CDF) and the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) remained high in Chin State, Sagaing and Magway regions, leading to increased displacement in Chin State and Sagaing Region. The largest increases were observed in southern Sagaing, where attacks on villages displaced thousands of people from Kale Township. Shortages of food, winter items, as well as fuel and medical supplies remain a concern for the displaced and the host communities, particularly in Chin State. Some 15,000 persons are estimated to remain of those that crossed into India since February 2021., In Rakhine State: IDPs across Rakhine State, as well as non-displaced Rohingya communities, continue to face challenges in accessing basic services, livelihoods, and humanitarian assistance, exacerbated by rising commodity prices and strict COVID-19 prevention measures. The tension between the Arakan Army and Tatmadaw continues in Rakhine State. Incidents of arson were reported in Rakhine and Rohingya villages in Mrauk-U, causing concern among communities about the potential for resumption of conflict.

Water Sanitation Hygiene",21 Jan 2022,"IOM Vision, Throughout 2021, Myanmar has seen surges of civil unrest, disruptions of essential services and widespread internal displacement as well as complex cross-border movements. IOM, in coordination with humanitarian and development partners, seeks to upscale and strengthen provision of essential and life-saving multi-sectoral assistance to affected populations￼￼￼,￼￼ while building local capacities for response and recovery. Recognizing the complex mobility dynamics and cross-border implications of the crisis, IOM country offices in Myanmar and Thailand will continue to monitor mobility dynamics related to the crisis, and coordinate to ensure that preparedness actions and targeted response capacities are in place and strengthened., CONTEXT ANALYSIS, The ongoing, interlinked crises in Myanmar continue to exacerbate preexisting vulnerabilities and give rise to new multi-sectoral needs, including health, food, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), livelihoods and protection. Further, the combined impacts of the political crisis, interruption to essential services, deteriorating security conditions and the continued spread of COVID-19 in Myanmar and the region have led to increasingly complex and mixed mobility flows internally and internationally. As of the end of 2021, OCHA estimates 400,000 have been newly displaced across Myanmar due to clashes and insecurity since 1 February, in addition to more than 340,000 in situations of protracted displacement prior to 2021. In addition, over 70,000 Myanmar migrants have returned from Thailand since January 2021, with increased irregular movements between Myanmar and Thailand in recent months. In the current context, protection risks related to gender-based violence, trafficking, exploitation and abuse have increased for migrants and displaced populations. Households are struggling to meet their needs after losing regular sources of income from jobs and remittances, giving rise to increasing levels of debt and use of negative coping mechanisms such factors and shocks have reversed or severely compromised previous development gains. Affected populations include individuals facing protracted and new displacement, internal migrants displaced from periurban areas, Myanmar migrants returning from abroad, host communities and migrant-sending/receiving households., With a highly porous border between Thailand and Myanmar that has typically seen dynamic, regular and irregular crossborder flows, movement between the two countries continued in 2021 despite official border closure. Between March and May 2021, IOM’s mobility monitoring mechanism estimated about 4,000 Myanmar nationals entering Thailand monthly.
These numbers reduced to about 2,000 per month between June and August as a result of heightened mobility restrictions, increased COVID-19 infections on both sides of the border and challenges crossing the river during the rainy season. From September 2021, estimated arrivals into Thailand have been increasing again due to the continuing deterioration of the situation in Myanmar, the gradual reopening of Thailand’s borders and the end of the rainy season.
The cross-border movement is expected to remain dynamic and complex as Myanmar nationals represent one of the largest migrant populations in Thailand. Three million Myanmar nationals were estimated living in Thailand before 2021. In 2022, Thailand estimates requiring about half a million labour migrants to help resume economic activity in line with overall COVID-19 recovery efforts. This combined with the deteriorating situation in Myanmar, is likely to contribute to increased mobility between the two countries with many Myanmar nationals arriving in Thailand in search of economic opportunity while others will continue to flee unrest and the deteriorating COVID-19 situation in Myanmar. The ongoing pandemic will further increase the vulnerability of Myanmar nationals and border communities and heighten protection risks as irregular crossings are likely to continue in the foreseeable future.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-crisis-response-plan-2022-myanmar-and-thailand

This figure includes 217,900 IDPs in Kayah, Kayin, Shan (South) States and Bago East and Tanintharyi Region. In addition, it is estimated that 1,200 people remain on the Thai side of the border for safety and access to basic services such as water, shelter, health and food., The main hosting area for new IDPs are currently Taunggyi and its surrounding townships in Shan (South) State with 15,238 new people who arrived last week. In Loikaw, it was reported that 80% of the population had left the area to find safety due to the continuous clashes with shelling and airstrikes. Furthermore, the displacement within Kayah State had brought about 2,125 newly displaced to Demoso, Hpruso and South Pekon. However, the continuous airstrikes and clashes in those areas had led to secondary displacements., In Kayin State, clashes intensified in Myawaddy, Kawkareik and Hpapun townships with shelling and airstrikes as well as attacks on the roads. 186 people displaced towards Hpa-an and Hpapun, most of them as secondary displacements. In Lay Kay Kaw, IDPs are also moving to safer locations with better access to services and assistance.",https://reliefweb.int/map/myanmar/myanmar-emergency-overview-map-number-people-displaced-south-east-feb-2021-and-remain-10

Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding
Protection and Human Rights",19 Jan 2022,"Last week in East and Southeast Asia, the Myanmar military carried out airstrikes in Kayah and Kayin states, as well as in the Sagaing region. North Korea conducted two new missile tests. In the Philippines, one person died in an IED explosion reportedly carried out by the Islamic State (IS)-linked group Al-Khobar. In Indonesia, a two-day clash between ethnic Papuan groups led to significant damage to civilian houses in Jayawijaya regency, Papua province. In the Deep South of Thailand, a decrease in political violence was reported as peace talks continued., Armed clashes between military forces and ethnic armed organizations and/or local defense forces were reported in nine states and regions across **Myanmar **over the past week. Notably, the military conducted airstrikes in Kayah and Kayin states, as well as in Sagaing region, last week. In recent months, there has been an increase in the use of aerial bombardment by the military, resulting in the further displacement of civilian populations., In Kayah state, military forces launched air and ground offensives and besieged the state capital of Loikaw last week. The offensive came after days of heavy fighting with the coalition of Karenni National Progressive Party/Karenni Army (KNPP/KA), Karenni Nationalities Defense Force (KNDF), and other Karenni resistance groups around central Loikaw. The military targeted Loikaw with airstrikes on 8 January, and had reportedly cut off water and electricity supply to all of Loikaw township by 9 January (Myanmar Now, 14 January 2022). At least half of the town’s 50,000 residents have fled after clashes in the urban center intensified (Myanmar Now, 12 January 2022)., Elsewhere, in neighboring Kayin state, the military began firing heavy artillery into villages in Kawkareik township on 8 January. The artillery fire came a day after unknown assailants destroyed a petrol truck believed to be transporting petrol for the military in Kawkareik township. Clashes between military forces and joint forces of Karen National Union/Karen National Liberation Army (KNU/KNLA) and PDF were subsequently reported on 10 January., In western Myanmar, the bodies of 10 civilians – including a 13-year-old boy and the editor-in-chief of Chin-based Khonumthung Media – were discovered on 8 January in Matupi township, Chin state. Most of the bodies bore signs of torture, including some found with gunshot wounds. According to local sources, the bodies belonged to those who were taken away by military troops on 6 and 7 January as human shields (Irrawaddy, 10 January 2022). In Sagaing region, the military deployed three helicopters and conducted airstrikes in Ohn Hnauk village, Pale township on 10 January. State media claims that the airstrikes targeted local PDF groups holding a meeting (Irrawaddy, 11 January 2022)., On 11 January, North Korea test-fired an alleged hypersonic ballistic missile that landed into the sea east of the Korean peninsula, outside Japan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) (The Guardian, 11 January 2022). It was the second missile launch this year, following a missile test on 5 January. In response to the test, the US imposed a series of sanctions targeting North Korean nationals involved in the nuclear program and announced that it will seek UN sanctions if tests continue (Time, 16 January 2022). Following the latest round of US sanctions, North Korea test-fired two suspected short-range ballistic missiles on 14 January. Experts claim that these tests were conducted in an apparent strategy to pressure the US ahead of potential future negotiations to obtain greater concessions (AP, 15 January 2022). UN Security Council resolutions ban ballistic missile and nuclear tests by North Korea., Last week in the Philippines, a rarely reported Islamist group called Al-Khobar was the primary suspect in a bombing attack on a bus line in Cotabato, which led to the death of a five-year-old child and injuries to six others. The group originated in the early 2000s as a splinter of the Islamist separatist group Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) that turned to extortion activities (CNN, 1 February 2011; Philippine News Agency, 7 March 2021). In this manner, the military has described Al-Khobar as an “extortion gang” that targets private firms (Philippine News Agency, 14 January 2022). Al-Khobar also has close ties to groups aligned with IS. Al-Khobar’s founder, Salahuddin Hassan, was also the leader of the IS-inspired Dawlah Islamiyah until his killing in October 2021 (AP, 29 October 2021). Dawlah Islamiyah is believed to be an umbrella group for various militant Islamist groups that operate in the Southern Philippines ​​(International Crisis Group, 27 June 2019)., In Indonesia, rival communal militias from the Nduga and Lanny Jaya regencies clashed in Jayawijaya regency, Papua province on 8 January. The clash was triggered by the killing of a resident of Nduga regency by a Lanny Jaya regency local earlier that day. Two people were wounded during the clash, in which both groups used machetes, axes, and spears and burned houses in the district. The following day, another clash broke out between the two groups. A civilian was killed, while 21 others were injured, and at least 40 houses were burned. Communal violence is not uncommon in Papua province. In October 2021, six people were killed in the province when armed members of the Kimyal tribe attacked residents from the Yali tribe in Dekai district, Yahukimo regency., In the Deep South of Thailand, there was a decrease in political violence last week as Thai authorities and Malay Muslim separatists met and agreed on a framework for further rounds of peace talks (Bangkok Post, 15 January 2022). It was the first face-to-face meeting since the previous round was held in March 2020 (Benar News, 7 January 2022) The latest peace talks took place after increased violence in the final days of 2021. Since a separatist insurgency reignited in the Muslim-majority region in 2004, thousands of people have been killed in violence across the Deep South (SCMP, 14 January 2022).",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/acled-regional-overview-east-and-southeast-asia-8-14-january-2022

Fighting has intensified in southeastern Kayah and Kayin states since December. Some 162,000 people, including women and children, remain displaced in the two states after fleeing their homes since May 2021. More than 650 houses, monasteries, churches and schools have reportedly been burnt or destroyed in Kayah State alone., “We are deeply worried about the new wave of violence and fighting targeting civilians in southeast Myanmar. We condemn yesterday’s airstrike which affected hundreds of people. These were communities that had already been forced to flee their homes because of violence, and sheltered at the displacement site in search of protection and safety. This indiscriminate targeting and killing of civilians must end., “The fighting is causing death, more displacement and disrupting access to critical services and humanitarian aid.

This is in addition to the 340,000 people living in protracted displacement before February 2021., • A small number of partners were able to reach IDPs and other affected people in acute conflict areas during December, but greater access remains critical for the urgent delivery of humanitarian assistance to hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people., • At the end of the year, the Humanitarian Response plan was 58 per cent funded receiving US$225.3 million of the $385.7 million requested for 2021. In 2022, the humanitarian community requires increased funding to bring in additional resources to scale up its efforts to address the unmet and escalating needs., • On 31 December, the 2022 Humanitarian Needs Overview was published identifying 14.4 million people in need. The 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan will be published by the end of January outlining efforts to reach 6.2 million people with assistance and requiring $826 million., KEY FIGURES, 320K people currently displaced across Myanmar by clashes and insecurity since February 2021, 175K people currently displaced in southeast Myanmar by insecurity and clashes since February 2021, 132K people currently displaced in Chin State, Magway and Sagaing regions by clashes and insecurity since May 2021, 17K people currently displaced in Shan since January 2021 and in Kachin since March 2021 due to clashes and insecurity, SITUATION OVERVIEW, The security and humanitarian situation in Myanmar remains volatile, with civilians bearing the brunt of ongoing armed clashes between the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) and Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs) and/or various PDFs, as well as between EAOs, in multiple states and regions. In Kayin and Kayah states, as well as Magway and Sagaing regions, clashes have intensified, resulting in increasing civilian casualties, destruction of civilian properties and internal and cross-border displacement., Since the February military takeover, more than 2,200 houses and other civilian properties have reportedly either been burnt down or destroyed, mainly in Chin (800), Kayah (654), Sagaing (529), and Magway (223). As of 27 December 2021, an estimated 320,900 people were internally displaced due to clashes and insecurity since 1 February, according to UNHCR figures. The southeast of the country (Kayin, Kayah and southern Shan) recorded the highest new internal displacement with 175,700 IDPs (55 per cent), followed by the northwest part (Sagaing, Magway and Chin) with 132,200 IDPs (41 per cent), Shan with 14,400 IDPs (four per cent) and Kachin with 3,200 IDPs (one per cent). In addition, 340,000 people remain displaced due to earlier conflicts before 2021. This includes 106,800 people in protracted displacement camps (since 2011) in Kachin and northern Shan; 144,000, mostly Rohingya people, in camps in Rakhine State (since 2012); and 79,900 people displaced in Rakhine State and southern Chin due to conflict between the Arakan Army (AA) and the MAF from early 2019 and late 2020.

Health
Protection and Human Rights",13 Jan 2022,"This Situation Update describes events that occurred in T‘Naw Th’Ree (Tanintharyi) Township, Mergui-Tavoy District, including the problems that local villagers are facing. Anti-coup protests and a Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) have taken place since the State Administration Council (SAC) seized power. There has been a lack of security for the participants who joined the protests and CDM, and some have fled to areas within Mergui-Tavoy District where they have received protection from the Karen National Union (KNU). The SAC military has increased troop rotation in the area, and have set up local militias, one of which shot a teenage boy who was out at night after curfew. Villagers have faced increasing arbitrary taxation, and are experiencing greater livelihood, education and healthcare challenges.[1], Political situation and the SAC military, Since the State Administration Council (SAC)[2] took power, villagers fear that fighting will happen again [like in the past]. The price of food has been rising so villagers are concerned that they won’t be able to have enough food in the future. Travel has also been restricted. The SAC military[3] are often searching for and arresting civilians who participate in the anti-coup protests. Some civilians who participate in the protests are afraid to sleep in their house at night so they have to find a safe place to sleep. Government staff [participating in the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM)[4]] in T’Naw Th’Ree (Tanintharyi) Township, Mergui-Tavoy District have felt and experienced this as well. These civilians are in need of a temporary safe place to protect [shelter] themselves [from arrest or violence by the SAC]. The Karen National Union (KNU)[5] leaders from T’Naw Th’Ree Township already have a plan to protect the civilians who participate in the protests (including the government staff [who join the CDM]), and to support them in fleeing to [other locations within] T’Naw Th’Ree Township., There are over 40 SAC battalions in Mergui-Tavoy District. The SAC usually rotate their troops every two or three months. Some of the battalions based in T’Naw Th’Ree Township are: Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[6] #561 in Nyaung Kwin A’Nauk Kan Hton Taw village, LIB #558 in Kan M’Laing village, LIB #559 and #560 in Lay Nya [village], LIB #557 in Kin village, A’Ma Ta [artillery camp] #306 in Maw Ton village, and Yay Phyu (Yebyu) operation command in Yay Phyu village. Most of those SAC troops also operate in T’Naw Th’Ree Township, including the areas near the river banks. The SAC troops increased their military movement and reinforced their army camps after the military coup. (They also did so after the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA)[7] in 2015). Since the coup, they [the SAC] have been secretly surveilling the movement and situation of Karen revolutionaries and civilians. Moreover, they have a plan to form a militia in every area [the SAC military junta would like to form a militia in every village]. Civilians in Dawei Town have also been prohibited from watching the news on television., On March 16th 2021 at 7:45 pm, Htoh Htoh, a soldier in the SAC militia [pyithusit (People’s Militia)] based in A--- village, shot dead a student named Maung[8] B---, aged 17 years old, Grade 8, of Buddhist-Bamar ethnicity and living in A--- village, T’Naw Th’Ree Township. His father is U[9] C--- and his mother is Daw[10] D---. There are people of both Karen and Bamar ethnicity living in that village. The reason why the militia shot him [Maung B---] is because he went out at night [after curfew]. [KHRG received this information from the KNU in T’Naw Th’Ree Township.] [According to KHRG’s researcher,] we [the local villagers] do not know how the Myanmar government will take action [to resolve this case and punish the perpetrator]. The village [A--- village] is under mixed control. The militia was first established in the village before the [2015] NCA was signed. Since the NCA, there had been no more militia in that village, but after the Tatmadaw seized power, they re-formed the militia in most of the villages., Civilians’ livelihood situation, There are 62 Karen villages in T’Naw Th’Ree Township. The Karen villagers live in three types of locations: islands, rural areas and areas close to the [Thai] border. Most of the Karen civilians who live in rural areas work in the following: plantation farming (in plains areas and hill farms), other plantation work such as on rubber plantations, casual day labour, and buying/selling livestock. The Karen villagers who live on the local islands work in fishing or make charcoal [to sell]. But their work has been disrupted by the Myanmar Military Intelligence [especially for those who work on the islands]. The Myanmar Military Intelligence required them to pay fines [fees] and they have had to buy petrol for the Myanmar Navy. The civilians who buy/sell livestock in the rural areas have also had to pay arbitrary taxes to the Myanmar Military Intelligence, Myanmar Forestry Department, Myanmar Police Force and Myanmar military troops who are based along the border of T‘Naw Th’Ree Township., Health situation, There is one Karen Department of Health and Welfare (KDHW)[11] clinic in E--- village, T’Naw Th’Ree Township. There are also Karen health workers in that clinic to treat the patients. The majority of illnesses that the villagers are facing are: malaria, diarrhoea, arthritis, anaemia and stroke. Villagers in some of the areas have access to Myanmar government healthcare services, such as midwives and nurses who can test for malaria. However, not all of the illnesses that the villagers are facing can be treated [at the local clinics] so they have to go to [the hospital] in Dawei Town in order to receive treatment., Education situation, There are three Karen schools in T’Naw Th’Ree Township: Thoo Lei Plaw Middle School, Ba Hkwa Primary School, and P’Naw Thaw Primary School. All of the schools are managed by the KNU in T’Naw Th’Ree Township. The school curriculum comes directly from the Karen Education and Culture Department (KECD)[12] education system. The school teachers are of Karen ethnicity. They do not have enough support or enough food [for the students] in their school. Therefore, they are seeking more support. According to P’Doh Saw Seh Hkay, head of the KECD in T’Naw Th’Ree Township, they need support from NGOs for the three schools in order to run the school administration for the education of the next [younger] generation. Additionally, all three schools are still open and continue their teaching as planned despite the COVID-19 pandemic and military coup, which shows their strength [resilience]., Conclusion, After the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA), civilians were able to travel freely and work freely for their livelihood. But since February 1st 2021, when the Tatmadaw seized power, civilians have been concerned that fighting will resume in KNU-controlled areas of Mergui-Tavoy District. Currently, the civilians flee into the jungle. The local villagers are afraid of the SAC troop rotations and there are many problems for the participants in the CDM., Further background reading on the security situation in Mergui-Tavoy District in Southeast Myanmar can be found in the following KHRG reports:, Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in March 2021. It was provided by a community member in Mergui-Tavoy who has been trained by KHRG to monitor human rights conditions on the ground. The names of the victims, their photos and the exact locations are censored for security reasons. The parts in square brackets are explanations added by KHRG., [2] The State Administration Council (SAC) is the executive governing body created in the aftermath of the February 1st 2021 military coup. It was established by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on February 2nd 2021, and is composed of eight military officers and eight civilians. The chairperson serves as the de facto head of government of Myanmar and leads the Military Cabinet of Myanmar, the executive branch of the government. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of SAC chairperson following the coup., [3] The term most commonly used in referring to Myanmar’s armed forces is Tatmadaw. The term has been used by KHRG throughout its reporting history, and most consistently during periods of civilian government. Since the February 1st 2021 coup and the military’s establishment of the State Administration Council (SAC) as the executive governing body of Myanmar, Myanmar’s armed forces have also come to be referred to as the SAC military. KHRG uses the term SAC military in specific reference to the Myanmar military since the February 1st 2021 coup. During previous periods of military rule, KHRG also used the names adopted by the military government in referring to the Tatmadaw (i.e. SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council] between 1988 to 1997, and SPDC [State Peace and Development Council] from 1998 to 2011), because these were the terms commonly used by villagers in KHRG research areas., [4] On February 2nd 2021, healthcare workers at state-run hospitals and medical facilities across Myanmar spearheaded what is being referred to as a Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) consisting of labour strikes in protest against the February 1st 2021 military coup. The movement quickly spread to include civil servants from all sectors of the government who are walking off their jobs as a way of non-recognition and non-participation in the military regime. Because of the popularity of the movement, and its seminal role in wider protests across the country, some people have begun using it as a catch-all phrase to include other protest forms like boycotts and pot-banging., [5] The Karen National Union (KNU) is the main Karen political organisation. It was established in 1947 and has been in conflict with the Burma/Myanmar government since 1949. The KNU wields power across large areas of Southeast Myanmar and has been calling for the creation of a democratic federal system since 1976. Although it signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement in 2015, relations with the government remain tense., [6] A Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) comprises 500 soldiers. Most Light Infantry Battalions in the Tatmadaw are under-strength with less than 200 soldiers, yet up-to-date information regarding the size of battalions is hard to come by, particularly following the signing of the NCA. LIBs are primarily used for offensive operations, but they are sometimes used for garrison duties., [7] On October 15th 2015, after a negotiation process marred with controversy over the notable non-inclusion of several ethnic armed groups, a Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) was signed between the Burma/Myanmar government and eight of the fifteen ethnic armed groups originally invited to the negotiation table, including the Karen National Union. It was followed by the adoption of a Code of Conduct by the signatories in November 2015. In February 2018, two additional ethnic armed groups signed the NCA under pressure from the Burma/Myanmar government., [8] Maung is a Burmese male honorific title used before a person’s name., [9] U is a Burmese title used for elder men, used before their name., [10] Daw is a Burmese female honorific title used before a person’s name., [11] The Karen Department of Health and Welfare (KDHW) is the health department of the Karen National Union. It was established in 1956 to address the lack of public healthcare resources in rural Southeast Myanmar. It currently operates a network of community-based clinics in the region, but its capabilities remain limited due to funding constraints., [12] The Karen Education and Culture Department is the education department of the Karen National Union. Its main goals are to provide mother tongue education services to rural Karen populations in Southeast Myanmar, as well as to preserve the Karen language, culture and history. Despite being an important education provider in the region, it is not officially recognised by the Myanmar government.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/mergui-tavoy-district-situation-update-sac-militia-shoots-teenage-villager-cdm-and

Mr. Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on Myanmar Ms. Noeleen Heyzer urged for immediate action based on strengthened United Nations - Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) cooperation to prevent further deterioration of the situation in Myanmar and address the desperate needs of its people. She expressed deep concern about continued intensification of military operations, including aerial attacks in parts of the country, emphasising that the people of Myanmar needed to see indicators and results on the ground, requiring any goodwill to be demonstrated in concrete terms., As highlighted in her discussions with ASEAN Foreign Ministers, the Special Envoy appreciated the confidence of regional leaders in her trust-building efforts with all stakeholders in Myanmar and reliable assessment of the situation on the ground, based on regular contacts with affected communities across the country who continue to appeal for her support and urgent assistance., The Special Envoy underlined her readiness to help strengthen regional efforts towards effective urgent implementation of the “Five-Point Consensus,” aligned with the will of the people of Myanmar. The Special Envoy stressed that a Myanmar-led process, that is guided by the will of the people, towards a peaceful, democratic and inclusive future needed to be supported by a coherent international approach grounded on regional unity, She committed to working closely with the Chair of ASEAN and its members towards this end, making available the wide array of comparative advantages and expertise of the United Nations to reinforce and complement regional action, grounded on the “Five-Point Consensus,” as a vital step., The Special Envoy underlined the urgency for an expanded approach to providing humanitarian assistance. In this respect, she highlighted an UN-ASEAN “humanitarian plus” umbrella could coordinate and deliver assistance to affected communities through all existing channels, and address the multiple priority needs of the people across the country. This would include civilian protection as well as food security, socio-economic resilience, humanitarian and COVID assistance. The Special Envoy welcomed the Prime Minister’s invitation to co-facilitate such efforts., She also stressed the importance of advancing the “Five-Point Consensus,” including an immediate cessation of violence, and for all parties to exercise utmost restraint. For this, the Special Envoy advocated for confidence-building measures involving all stakeholders, in addition to ethnic armed organizations. In this regard, she proposed the UN and ASEAN, as part of its “humanitarian plus” joint action, consider pursuing with all sides a humanitarian pause in targeted areas to allow safe and unhindered access., The Special Envoy reiterated her offer to work closely with the Special Envoy of the ASEAN Chair. This meant bringing in broader support from the international community and United Nations system around a coordinated strategy towards creating an enabling environment for inclusive dialogue., She emphasized solutions needed to derive from engaging directly with and listening carefully to all those affected by the ongoing crisis. For example, the Special Envoy encouraged the formation of an UN-ASEAN Women, Peace and Security platform to amplify the voices of women and young people, including from hard-to-reach areas. She looks forward to future discussions with the ASEAN Foreign Ministers to pave the way on the concrete recommendations for joint action.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/readout-special-envoy-secretary-general-myanmar-s-virtual-call-prime-minister-kingdom
"Atrocity Alert No. 283: Myanmar (Burma), Nigeria and Kazakhstan",News and Press Release,GCR2P,Protection and Human Rights,12 Jan 2022,"Atrocity Alert is a weekly publication by the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect highlighting situations where populations are at risk of, or are enduring, mass atrocity crimes., MYANMAR MILITARY LAUNCHES AIR STRIKES IN KAYAH STATE, DISPLACING THOUSANDS, Since 6 January the military in Myanmar (Burma) – the Tatmadaw – has perpetrated a large-scale offensive against Loikaw, the capital of Kayah State, in what may become the heaviest bombardment of a major urban center in Myanmar since the 1 February coup, according to local media. The military has launched several air strikes, including an attack as recently as 11 January, and is continuing to fire heavy weaponry in an attempt to quell anti-junta forces active in the city. At least six civilians have been killed and approximately 60,000 – nearly two thirds of the city’s residents – have been forced to flee since the assault began. A military blockade and ongoing hostilities have prevented additional civilians from fleeing and humanitarian groups from entering the city., Kayah State – also known as Karenni State – is mainly inhabited by the minority Karenni ethnic group, which is predominantly Christian. For decades, the military has battled intermittently with armed Karenni groups, and hostilities have intensified since the coup. In recent weeks, the Tatmadaw has increasingly perpetrated attacks against civilians and ethnic militias throughout the region. A particularly grave attack occurred on 24 December, when the military shot and burned at least 35 civilians, including four children and two staff of Save the Children, near Mo So village of Hpruso town in Kayah State., The UN Security Council condemned the killings with a Press Statement on 29 December, and said that, “the members of the Council called for the immediate cessation of all violence and emphasized the importance of respect for human rights and of ensuring safety of civilians.” Although the Council called for accountability, the statement stopped short of naming the Tatmadaw as the perpetrator., Savita Pawnday, Executive Director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “nearly one year since the 1 February coup, the UN Security Council has only managed to meet privately and issue Press Statements on the situation in Myanmar. The Council needs to hold an open session on Myanmar as soon as possible in order to address the crisis in a public forum so Council members are no longer able to hide behind empty Press Statements and make their plans for action – or lack thereof – public.” The airstrikes on Loikaw and the Christmas Eve massacre point to a dangerous escalation and underscore the urgent need for the Security Council to impose a global arms embargo on Myanmar. UN member states, including ASEAN, should impose targeted sanctions on the oil and gas sectors, the country’s single largest source of foreign currency revenue, to limit the Tatmadaw’s ability to fund and perpetrate atrocities., HUNDREDS OF CIVILIANS KILLED BY ARMED BANDITS IN NORTH-WEST NIGERIA, At least 200 people were killed and 10,000 displaced as result of a series of attacks by armed bandits in Nigeria’s north-western Zamfara state between 4 and 6 January. Local media have reported that the search for more bodies continues as many people remain missing. The attacks began on Tuesday in the Anka Local Government Area, where more than 300 armed men on motorcycles raided at least eight villages, then subsequently raided 10 more villages in Anka and Bukkuyum Local Government Area on Wednesday and Thursday. Survivors said the armed men reportedly stole approximately 2,000 cattle, burnt homes and mutilated the bodies of the victims. In a statement on 10 January, UN Secretary-General António Guterres strongly condemned the “appalling attacks” in Zamfara and urged the Nigerian authorities “to spare no effort in bringing those responsible for these heinous crimes to justice.”, Conflict between herding and farming communities over land and resources has grown over the past decade in north-west Nigeria. Inter-communal violence has become increasingly deadly as a result of the proliferation of armed banditry groups and gangs who engage in organized cattle-rustling, kidnapping, plunder, murder and rape. While bandit groups are driven largely by criminal motives, ethnic tensions have intensified as many bandits are ethnic Fulani and prey on settled farming communities. Inter-communal conflict has also been further exacerbated by deteriorating political, economic and security conditions, including threats posed by the armed extremist groups Boko Haram and the so-called Islamic State in West Africa., In an attempt to curb armed banditry in north-west Nigeria, in September 2021 the Nigerian government launched renewed campaigns in the region, deploying a large number of troops, cutting off communication networks and imposing restrictions on movement in affected areas. This militarized approach, however, has inadvertently strengthened bandit groups and resulted in an increase of reprisal attacks against civilian populations. Last week’s attacks in Zamfara were believed to be in response to air raids conducted by the military against bandit hideouts in the Gusami forest and west Tsamre village on 3 January that killed more than 100 bandits, including two of their leaders., Juliette Paauwe, Senior Research Analyst at the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, said that, “while military operations against armed bandits can be successful in the short-term, the Nigerian government needs to pursue sustainable solutions that address the underlying drivers of inter-communal conflicts like endemic poverty, corruption, youth unemployment and environmental degradation to comprehensively address the threat posed by armed bandits.”, AT LEAST 164 DEAD IN UNPRECEDENTED VIOLENT CRACKDOWN ON PROTESTS IN KAZAKHSTAN, Since protests erupted on 2 January, Kazakhstan experienced its most intense and violent crisis in its thirty-year history after independence. Peaceful protests began in Zhanaozen, an oil town in western Kazakhstan, over a steep increase in gas prices. By 4 January protests spread across the country, expanding the scope of demands to include long-standing socio-economic and political grievances. Nationwide dissent peaked a day later on 5 January, escalating into large-scale looting and clashes in the country’s largest city, Almaty, and resulting in brutal retaliatory violence from the state. According to Kazakh officials, more than 2,000 people have been injured, nearly 10,000 detained and at least 164 killed during the wave of violence and unrest., As nationwide protests intensified, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev declared a state of emergency in several areas of the country, including Almaty and the capital, Nur-Sultan. The state of emergency has since been extended to the whole country until 19 January. In Almaty, riot police allegedly used tear gas and stun grenades in clashes with protesters. At the same time, demonstrators seized some government buildings, setting them on fire, and attempted to storm police stations., UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, stressed that, “international law is clear: people have the right to peaceful protest and freedom of expression. At the same time, protesters, no matter how angry or aggrieved they may be, should not resort to violence against others.”, President Tokayev called the protests and riots “an act of aggression” and reportedly gave security forces a shoot-to-kill order against protesters, who he called “bandits and terrorists.” This order came as President Tokayev requested assistance from the Collective Security Treaty Organization – a Russian-led security alliance of six countries in the region – to suppress the protests. Approximately 2,300 troops from the alliance were deployed. Security forces have since forcibly regained control in Kazakhstan, employing live fire to end the unrest in Almaty, the epicenter of the violence. Of the 164 people killed, 103 of the deaths were in Almaty, according to the health ministry., While Kazakhstan has been regarded as a pillar of political and economic stability in the region, authorities have long restricted fundamental rights and ignored demands for genuine socio-economic and political reforms, such as lifting restrictions on peaceful protest and free speech and bans on opposition groups. Rampant economic inequality and discontent has also been growing for decades., Although a relative calm has been restored in Almaty following nearly a week of unrest, risks for further violence remain as security forces continue to heavily guard the city. It is imperative that security forces and protesters refrain from violence and seek a peaceful resolution to grievances. The police and all security forces must respect their international obligations and protect human rights during the state of emergency. Kazakh officials must promptly, independently and thoroughly investigate all allegations of human rights violations.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/atrocity-alert-no-283-myanmar-burma-nigeria-and-kazakhstan

Myanmar: Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) remember home,News and Press Release,JRS,Protection and Human Rights,3 Jan 2022,"Last February, political turmoil in Myanmar left thousands scrambling to survive amidst abductions, warrantless arrests, and sexual violence. The consequences of the military coup have worsened issues of food security, inflation, and poverty, on top of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic., Across the country, critics of the coup and their families are being pursued by the junta and subject to abduction, torture, and detention. Numerous reports speak of military attacks against civilians, especially in hardest hit areas like the Kayah state., One of the main challenges is represented by the hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons (IDPs). Having been forced to flee their homes, IDPs now need shelter, water, food, fuel, and healthcare. Without these essentials, they remain at risk of starvation, disease, and exposure., In the following testimonies, internally displaced persons in Myanmar reflect on the meaning of home through the memories of what they have left and the objects that came to represent safety in displacement., JB, “This sling shot is a piece of home for me. Wherever I go, it is always with me. I go hunting birds with this. I free cattle with the help of this sling shot. I feel safe when I hold this and when the danger is about to come, this is the weapon I can use to protect myself.”, Sue, “I miss my best friend. Her name is Nan Z. P. and we were very close and shared everything we had. After being an IDP for more than two months, I have never seen or heard news from her. This beautiful pink dress that she gave me is a piece of home and it reminds me of the happy and peaceful time we had together before the coup.”, A refugee returnee, displaced for the second time, “For me, home has never been certain as there are many armed conflicts happening everywhere after the coup. But for us, a cooking pot and a match are a very important piece of the house. Because wherever we are, when we flee from armed conflicts, this pot and a match are necessary for us. We need them to cook food to survive. We can boil drinking water and cook food. And by lighting the fire, match provides us warmth.”, Ne, “When I heard the word home, I imagine the tent that I am living in. Even though it has no full facilities like my house from the village, it currently gives us warmth and protects us from getting wet. It has the shadow of home, and it is the present home for me.”, Phaw, “According to my experience, tarpaulin is a piece of home when we are displaced. We need it to build temporary tent and it’s easier to bring along with us whenever we move. It can provide a place for my family to stay and sleep. It also protects us from the rain and makes us warm.”, Ray, “Home”
My dream of home was not so big
Just a place, my favorite space
Full of love, laughter and bliss
Always praying for the sake, My real home is not so big
It’s not grand and great
Scary sounds waken my deep sleep
Wish my little space would be safe, People say that Home Sweet Home
Is the place where love blooms?
But now, only fear has grown
Where is our Home Sweet Home?",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/myanmar-internally-displaced-persons-idps-remember-home

"Kler Lwee Htoo District Short Update: SAC troops fired mortars into a village, injuring three villagers, December 2021",Situation Report,KHRG,Protection and Human Rights,6 Jan 2022,"This Short Update describes events that occurred in Ler Doh Township, Kler Lwee Htoo District in December 2021. Three villagers (two children and one adult) were injured by mortars that SAC troops fired at their village following a skirmish between the SAC and the KNLA. A few days after this incident, and following another skirmish, SAC troops fired their weapons at a mother and child who were working in their paddy field.[1], On the evening of December 7th 2021, a skirmish occurred near H--- village, Kheh Der village tract[2], Ler Doh (Kyaukkyi) Township, Kler Lwee Htoo (Nyaunglebin) District when local [Brigade #3] Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA)[3] and Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO)[4] troops combined forces to attack State Administration Council (SAC)[5] Infantry Battlion (IB)[6] #75 at H--- army camp. Following the skirmish, SAC IB #75, which is led by Battalion Commander Zaw Zaw Naing and based at the army camp south of the village, fired mortars at H--- village. Two of the mortars exploded in the village, injuring three villagers., The skirmish took place at around 7:05 pm. Children and teenagers were gathering at the church to practice singing and dancing [in preparation to celebrate Christmas] when they heard gunfire around H--- village, causing them to flee and scatter through the village. Following the gunfire, the SAC troops[7] from IB #75 fired two mortars into the village, injuring three villagers., The three injured villagers are Saw[8] D---, a 25-year-old man; Saw B---, an 11-year-old boy; and Naw[9] C---, an 11-year-old girl. [All three had been at the church and fled at the sound of gunfire.] Saw D--- was struck by shrapnel on his chest, just below his left nipple. Saw B---’s left foot was struck by shrapnel and one of his toes was blown off. Naw C--- was hit by shrapnel on her left thigh, resulting in a minor injury. According to the villager who reported this incident to KHRG, all three injured villagers were initially treated by the local health worker, as there is no clinic or hospital in the village., On the morning of December 8th 2021, SAC soldiers from IB #75 called the H--- village administrator to check on the three injured villagers and asked him and fellow villagers to send those who had been injured to H--- army camp for proper treatment. All three injured villagers were sent to the IB #75 army camp and received treatment there. Both Saw B--- and Naw C--- were able to get [sufficient] treatment at the army camp, as their injuries were not serious [not life-threatening]. SAC soldiers told villagers that Saw D---‘s injury was serious and he was in critical condition [due to the location of the injury]., The SAC told Saw D---’s parents that they could not treat him at the army camp due to the severity of his injury, and the fact that the shrapnel was located close to his heart. According to one villager, the victim’s parents had two options to treat their son: the first option was to send their son to Ler Doh Town and get treatment at a hospital in the town, while the second option was to send their son to a hospital in a Karen National Union (KNU)[10]-controlled area in Mu Traw District. Ler Doh Town is far from H--- village and transportation to the town is difficult, so the parents decided to send their son to a hospital in a KNU-controlled area of Mu Traw District [the location in Mu Traw is also far from H--- village, but Saw D---'s parents felt safer sending their son to this location]. Saw D--- was transported to the hospital in a hammock carried by other villagers on the evening of December 8th 2021, and is currently being treated at the hospital in Mu Traw District., One villager reported that they [the villagers] are afraid because the SAC soldiers told them that, if fighting did occur near the village, it would be because the villagers were cooperating with “outsiders” [term used by the SAC, which villagers understood to mean the KNLA and KNDO] to allow the KNLA to attack them [the SAC troops]. The villager also added that the SAC soldiers told them that if they [the SAC troops] were attacked, they would fire at any location they thought the attack was coming from [meaning the SAC soldiers will fire indiscriminately in the direction of the attack, and mortars could land in the village]., A villager also reported that the SAC troops sent more trucks to their army camp at H--- in order to repair the vehicle roads and bring rations to their frontline army camps in the area, though the local KNU and KNLA have strictly forbidden the SAC from doing so. According to the local KNLA soldiers, as of December 14th 2021, 51 trucks with about 2,400 sacks of rice, ammunitions and other supplies have been sent to H--- army camp. Four SAC battalions were sent to the area in early December 2021: IB #124, Light Infantry Battalion (LIB)[11] #351, LIB #598 and LIB #440. IB #75 was already present in the area, so there are now five SAC battalions [in the area around H---]. Because they [the SAC] have increased troop presence in the area and are conducting more security operations in order to send rations, villagers are in a more difficult situation. Because H--- village is situated beside the vehicle road and surrounded by mountains, villagers are not able to relocate anywhere else., As of December 8th 2021, villagers do not dare go to their paddy farms to harvest and collect [their already] harvested paddy [the whole rice grain, including hulls] because they worry that the SAC troops will fire mortars at their farms. In addition, the SAC troops began conducting more military activities, making the [livelihood] situation even more difficult for local villagers., Second Incident, Five days after this incident, at around 1:00 pm on December 12th 2021, local KNLA and KNDO joined forces and attacked a group of SAC troops to the east of H--- village at L--- Place, when the SAC soldiers were returning to H--- army camp [from security patrol]. Following the attack, at around 2:00 pm, the same SAC troops that were attacked opened fire at a mother and child while the two were harvesting paddy on their farm. The SAC troops used several small arms [small assault rifles] and one M-79 [grenade launcher], which they launched from G--- Place [which is located in between L--- Place and H--- village]. The mother and child managed to run away, so there were no casualties., As of December 14th 2021, some villagers have gone to work on their farms, however, they are very cautious because they worry the SAC troops might shoot or fire at them., Further background reading on the situation of militarisation and human rights violations in Kler Lwee Htoo District in Southeast Myanmar can be found in the following KHRG reports:, ""Kler Lwee Htoo District Incident Report: One villager injured, another one missing after being shot at by the Tatmadaw in Moo Township, May 2021”, June 2021., “Kler Lwee Htoo District Short Update: Increased militarisation and fighting between the Tatmadaw and the KNLA prevent IDPs from returning home in Ler Doh Township, March to May 2021”, May 2021., Footnotes:, [1] The present document is based on information received in December 2021. It was provided by a community member in Kler Lwee Htoo District who has been trained by KHRG to monitor human rights conditions on the ground. The names of the victims, their photos and the exact locations are censored for security reasons. The parts in square brackets are explanations added by KHRG., [2] A village tract is an administrative unit of between five and 20 villages in a local area, often centred on a large village., [3] The Karen National Liberation Army is the armed wing of the Karen National Union., [4] The Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO) was formed in 1947 by the Karen National Union and is the precursor to the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). Today the KNDO refers to a militia force of local volunteers trained and equipped by the KNLA and incorporated into its battalion and command structure; its members wear uniforms and typically commit to two-year terms of service., [5] The State Administration Council (SAC) is the executive governing body created in the aftermath of the February 1st 2021 military coup. It was established by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on February 2nd 2021, and is composed of eight military officers and eight civilians. The chairperson serves as the de facto head of government of Myanmar and leads the Military Cabinet of Myanmar, the executive branch of the government. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of SAC chairperson following the coup., [6] An Infantry Battalion (Tatmadaw) comprises 500 soldiers. However, most Infantry Battalions in the Tatmadaw are under-strength with less than 200 soldiers. Yet up to date information regarding the size of battalions is hard to come by, particularly following the signing of the NCA. They are primarily used for garrison duty but are sometimes used in offensive operations., [7] The term most commonly used in referring to Myanmar’s armed forces is Tatmadaw. The term has been used by KHRG throughout its reporting history, and most consistently during periods of civilian government. Since the February 1st 2021 coup and the military’s establishment of the State Administration Council (SAC) as the executive governing body of Myanmar, Myanmar’s armed forces have also come to be referred to as the SAC military. KHRG uses the term SAC military in specific reference to the Myanmar military since the February 1st 2021 coup. During previous periods of military rule, KHRG also used the names adopted by the military government in referring to the Tatmadaw (i.e. SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration Council] between 1988 to 1997, and SPDC [State Peace and Development Council] from 1998 to 2011), because these were the terms commonly used by villagers in KHRG research areas., [8] Saw is a S'gaw Karen male honorific title used before a person's name., [9] Naw is a S’gaw Karen female honorific title used before a person’s name., [10] The Karen National Union (KNU) is the main Karen political organisation. It was established in 1947 and has been in conflict with the Burma/Myanmar government since 1949. The KNU wields power across large areas of Southeast Myanmar and has been calling for the creation of a democratic federal system since 1976. Although it signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement in 2015, relations with the government remain tense., [11] A Light Infantry Battalion (LIB) comprises 500 soldiers. However, most Light Infantry Battalions in the Tatmadaw are under-strength with less than 200 soldiers. Yet up to date information regarding the size of battalions is hard to come by. LIBs are primarily used for offensive operations, but they are sometimes used for garrison duties.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/kler-lwee-htoo-district-short-update-sac-troops-fired-mortars-village-injuring-three

COVID-19 Case Management Guideline for Home-Based Care in Myanmar [EN/MY],Manual and Guideline,WHO,Health,5 Jan 2022,"Introduction, This guideline is intended to help the health care providers who are providing life-saving medical treatment to COVID-19 patients in the context of home-based care when referring the patients to the designated health care facilities are not feasible. When possible, a doctor and his/her team* should follow the patient at home, in person or by teleconsultation to be sure that the family and the patient have the best follow up., It is strongly recommended to transfer the patients to the designated health care facilities whenever it is available and it is indicated at any point during the course of home-based management., Some investigations in this guideline may not be available in some parts of Myanmar and/or may not be done for a certain period of time due to limitation of the resources, health care providers are needed to treat the patient with their own clinical judgment. Similarly, some medicines are out of reach for various reasons, general measures such as prone position, breathing exercise, oxygen treatment, steroid therapy and anticoagulation therapy are paramount in managing mild to moderately severe COVID-19 patients and preventing the disease progression., As infection prevention control measures are the key component of preventing the COVID-19 disease transmission, caregiver training is important in managing the COVID-19 patients at home. Therefore, adequate time should be allowed to give proper training to caregivers and reassessment of their understanding and practicing while managing the patient either at home visit or via teleconsultation.",https://reliefweb.int/report/myanmar/covid-19-case-management-guideline-home-based-care-myanmar-enmy
